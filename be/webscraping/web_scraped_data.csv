engineering,https://www.uts.edu.au/study/engineering/courses/undergraduate-engineering-majors/software-engineering,"Software engineers focus on large, complex, and critical software systems that are interwoven into our daily lives.
Large, critical complex software systems are part of everyday life. For example large-scale infrastructures such as power distribution and traffic systems or autonomous vehicles or machinery, or personal online systems such as My eHealth and MyTax are run on complex software products. Demands to design, develop, deploy and maintain these systems are growing.
The fundamental focus for software engineers is to ensure that systems are resilient, perform as expected the first time and every time throughout their life, including the ability to deal with unusual combinations of events.
The Software Engineering major teaches you about the physical design, analysis and management of software to ensure safe, reliable, secure and maintainable systems. It goes beyond programming; you will develop skills to identify issues with existing systems and create new possibilities with the application of large-scale software design.
Roles be found in almost every large organisation across industry sectors including medical, transport, aviation, defence, telecommunications, banking and finance, tertiary research and development.
0:03  Today, we'll be covering a few different topics
0:06  regarding the whole idea of software. Essentially, what is
0:10  software engineering? What are potential career paths? How and
0:14  what exactly is software engineering at UTS and exactly some of the
0:19  subject pathways that you can pursue to get into that career
0:24  that you're really looking for. Of course we'll end this
0:26  session off with a quick Q&A, so if you have any questions, feel
0:30  free to pop in the chat and we can answer a little bit later
0:33  here today. So, at UTS we offer a variety of different majors
0:40  under the Bachelor of Engineering honours. For this
0:43  session we'll be focusing solely on software but if you
0:46  just look on the screen you can see that there are so many
0:49  different types of majors that you can go into. Here at UTS we
0:54  like to emphasise that you can do very much a flexible type of
0:58  major where you can just dabble in a lot of these different
1:00  areas and then finalise later on. If you look on the screen
1:04  you can also see that there's an asterisk on some of them, those
1:07  just mean that you can particularly do a double degree,
1:10  where you can see in the grey box area with those other
1:12  degrees. For myself, like I said beforehand, I do a double degree
1:16  in engineering and business. So I'm coupling those two together
1:20  and majoring in software. So you probably wondering a little bit
1:26  about what is software engineering, I would just read
1:29  the slide, but I'll give a little bit of my own particular
1:32  definition of why I believe, at the very end of the day, I
1:35  simply put it as we're here to solve critical problems. If you
1:40  have that mindset of problem solving, if you're looking to
1:43  innovate in your own particular way, this is probably a great
1:46  career path and potential area of education for yourself. If
1:52  you're looking to understand why you should study software
1:55  engineering, the future is becoming more technological.
1:59  Some of us say that we're entering a new sense of an
2:02  industrial revolution, in the sense, and being in software
2:05  engineering just helps pave the road down that path. At UTS we
2:09  like to say that we are very much future focused and with
2:12  software engineering you definitely reside with that
2:15  particular saying. Now, of course, when you come in with a
2:18  future focused mindset we have to do so with a mindset of
2:22  tackling real industry problems and of course those problems
2:26  have to be tied to a sense of global demand. And when you
2:29  pursue an engineering degree at UTS, you're globally recognised
2:33  for particular areas, across different companies that
2:36  recognise your degree as a credible education source. So
2:42  you're probably wondering what particular areas of software
2:46  that you can apply your degree towards. For myself, I have
2:51  dabbled in web development, I've done a little bit of machine
2:54  learning, applications, mobile development and the list goes
2:57  on. You can choose to dabble in many different areas, especially
3:01  at UTS itself, but it's ultimately up to you to choose
3:05  and pick your own journey and what you want to specialise in.
3:08  A lot of people love going into the hardware and IoT
3:10  applications, the Internet of Things, some people love
3:13  specialising in cloud services and software as a service. So,
3:17  ultimately, if you have any questions about what these
3:21  things are feel free to publish that later on and we can dive a
3:24  little bit more into the nitty gritty details. The premise of
3:28  computer science and software engineering is that computer
3:30  science is way more theoretical and with software engineering,
3:34  it's way more practical. So, in this sense, if you look at
3:38  computer science, if you're very interested in say like
3:40  mathematics, computational processes, then computer science
3:44  is probably the way to go but if you're looking to understand
3:47  the whole software development lifecycle of understanding user
3:50  requirements, tying those user requirements to specific key
3:55  products and ideas and then producing those into a
3:58  production which customers can actually utilise then software
4:01  engineering probably is a great pathway for yourself. So the
4:07  question really comes down to what is the challenge, right?
4:10  When you come into like a technological space, you know,
4:13  innovation is great, everyone has great ideas but you also
4:16  have to consider is it feasible, is a suitable, is it robust
4:20  enough for to be an actual product out into the world
4:24  itself? You can actually take real world example for my own
4:29  case, which I think a lot of us probably have understood or even
4:33  been aware of in the last year or so. We're going the
4:35  Coronavirus pandemic. Last year the government rolled out
4:41  a contact tracing application and in that contact tracing
4:45  application it was meant to solve the problem of how do we
4:48  track particular individuals, right, who have been exposed to
4:52  Coronavirus and how do we make sure to track those who have
4:57  been in the same proximity as those with Coronavirus. Now, the
5:00  government released a particular application that was supposed to
5:03  do those but it did experience some problems, of course. And in
5:08  their sense, they really want to say that was an innovative
5:11  experience or application to solve this particular problem
5:14  but they showcase that there were some issues in regards to
5:18  how many, what were the technical issues that they were
5:21  experiencing. For example, iPhones and Android
5:25  compatibility, there was issues with data sharing. Additionally, there
5:28  was also some issues with how do we exactly get people to opt
5:32  into the application, as well as participate in that pool so we
5:36  have this shared network of contact tracing within the
5:40  entire state itself. So as you can see, they had some
5:44  difficulties there but understanding these challenges
5:47  helps to produce better products into the future and you'll
5:50  definitely see this in many different areas within your
5:52  career if you do pursue a degree and a career into software
5:56  engineering itself. So anticipating the unexpected, as
6:00  well as being able to fit those user requirements about right,
6:05  is something that you definitely need to consider.
6:07  There are so many different types of careers that you can go
6:10  into itself. A lot of these probably just sound like names
6:14  to you, but I can group these a little bit so that it becomes a
6:18  little bit more digestible. As you can probably see there are
6:22  software engineering degrees, development and DevOps, DevOps
6:26  meaning it's much more into like the database kind of area. But
6:30  once you get into like the designer, consultant and
6:32  architect type of career path, that's bridging the gap between
6:36  the business and the technicals itself. So you have to
6:39  communicate with the software development teams while also
6:42  constructing the architecture of how the technology will interact
6:47  with one another, and, of course, if you'd like to go into a
6:50  little bit more of the front end, UI, UX design, being a
6:54  designer is a great place for you to fit into as well. So at
6:59  UTS, we, this is just a very simplified course structure,
7:03  this is what we recommend to follow when you are enrolled
7:06  into the Bachelor of Engineering honours degree. As you can see,
7:10  we have the engineering core subjects, those are just
7:13  covering the basics, as I mentioned beforehand, in regards
7:16  to dabbling in the different majors here UTS as well as just
7:21  setting the foundations of your mathematical skills. You might
7:24  even cover physics, for example, and then you get into the actual
7:28  major specific subjects such as your software engineering
7:30  degree and those usually follow a set course, but you also have
7:34  the option to select a few electives here and there, where
7:38  you want to specialise and learn about something that may be of
7:41  your interest. For myself, I want to learn a little bit more
7:44  about machine learning so I took a few machine learning
7:47  courses here at UTS and that's just to diversify my
7:52  experience and it's really great for the resume and CV. So, as it
7:56  shows at the bottom, you can definitely see that there's a
7:58  diploma of professional practice and usually a lot of
8:01  students opt in to do this diploma on top of their actual
8:04  degree. What this particularly means is that you get two six
8:08  month placement internship experiences. Typically students
8:11  do it in their second year and do the second one in their
8:14  fourth year. This will just provide you another extra level
8:17  of credibility, especially when you're going out in industry,
8:20  where it's very, it's very important to have that practical
8:24  experience. So once again, I just want to emphasise that
8:29  even if you don't think or know that you want to do software
8:33  engineering, we do say that engineering is very flexible.
8:36  Meaning that if you want to just go into a flexible engineering
8:39  degree at the start, that's perfectly fine, you can start
8:42  dabbling in different areas and different majors as you go on
8:45  and then you can decide in your like second and third year on
8:48  what major you want to pursue for the rest of your degree. And
8:52  of course, you can pick and choose your journey, and I like
8:55  emphasising that because if you have a specific interest in
8:59  different industries then you can combine that and create your
9:03  own sub major in that emerging area. As you can see, there's
9:06  renewable energy, there's advanced manufacturing and the
9:08  list goes on from there and of course, like I said, it's
9:11  flexible so you can definitely dabble into different areas as
9:14  you see fit. So we're gonna go into Jasmine's own personal
9:19  experiences. Jasmine, do you want to jump on?
9:23  Thanks, Andrew. So hi everyone, my name is Jasmine, again, and I
9:27  study a Bachelor of software engineering with a minor in
9:30  interaction design. So basically, interaction design is
9:34  how a user interacts with the software. So buttons, UI, things
9:38  like that, so UI is what you actually see. So I actually
9:42  started with a general engineering degree, so that's
9:44  what I went into here at UTS. That was for a few reasons; one
9:51  of them was I didn't quite make the ATAR to get into a software
9:53  engineering degree and the other one was, I'm not, I wasn't
9:56  entirely sure if software was the degree I wanted to do. So I
10:00  started with the general engineering, and that didn't
10:02  actually set me back at all, so I'm actually going to graduate a
10:06  little early, which is, which is quite nice. So I moved into
10:09  software engineering in my second year of university and
10:12  that transition was actually very, very easy to do, it was
10:15  just changing a major. So I've really enjoyed the course
10:19  so far. As I mentioned, I'm doing interaction design, so
10:22  that's taken up four of my electives and you get a total
10:25  of eight electives and so I've got into both minor and explore
10:29  some other areas. So I'm going to dabble in games development
10:32  next semester, which will be interesting to see, I've never
10:36  done that before and I'm going to graduate next year, which is
10:40  very exciting. So I've got to look into finishing my degree
10:45  and getting through all that. So I've done most of the course at
10:48  this point and I've, so far, I've really enjoyed it. So in my
10:54  first year, actually, I joined the Motorsports team at our
10:57  university. So what the Motorsports team is, is they
11:01  design and they build a race car Formula One style from scratch
11:05  every year. It's a big deal, big feat, a lot of mechanical,
11:09  electrical engineering students but at the time they had no one
11:12  in software and my sister was on the team. So she studied
11:16  mechanical and mechatronic engineering and so she
11:19  mentioned, hey, come join us, see what you can do and so I did,
11:23  and, but, I joined in my second semester of my first year and I
11:27  knew nothing about software at this point. I barely knew how to
11:30  code something on my own without a course requirement and so it
11:34  was a very big journey for me but it's really what sort of
11:37  sparked me to go out and learn on my own and really develop my
11:40  skills in the areas I was most interested in. So I ended up
11:44  developing two software programmes in the two years I
11:48  was with them and they were both for telemetry which,
11:50  telemetry is basically you have sensors on your car, maybe your
11:53  speedometer, for example, on your regular car, and it's how
11:56  do we show that to people so that they can interpret it and
11:59  make decisions based on that. So there were sensors on the car that
12:03  I was reading from and I displayed them. So the first
12:06  time it was more about how do I actually create this and then
12:09  the second time it was more about how do I make this very
12:12  easy to digest. So you have all of this data, it means nothing
12:16  to me. I don't know anything about the physics of a car but
12:19  I just wanted to make sure it was very easy to digest. So I
12:23  learned a lot about what I was most interested in through that
12:27  and I really refined my skills which I really recommend, going
12:32  outside of your coursework to really discover what you enjoy.
12:35  Because it's such a big industry, there's so much you
12:38  can do and so it's really good to dabble while you're still at
12:40  university and you have so much time and you're keen to still
12:44  learn, you're still in that learning mindset. So as for my
12:48  internships, so I do the diploma as well, which means I've done
12:51  two six month internships where I'm actually on my second one
12:54  now. So I've done two summer internships with Google, and I'm
12:59  currently on a six month internship with Apple. So big
13:04  names but they've been really enjoyable and I can honestly
13:08  say I don't think I would have felt as prepared for either of
13:11  them if I hadn't had that Motorsports experience and I
13:14  hadn't dabbled outside of my coursework. I really, I learnt
13:19  how to teach myself and how to ask for help through that. So
13:23  the two internships were incredible, so the two ones at
13:26  Google were both as a software engineer. I was put on a team,
13:30  so my first one was on Google Maps and my second one was on
13:34  what's called a site reliability engineer, so basically, the
13:36  people who maintain a software and make sure it keeps working.
13:40  So if there's an outage on an app then an SRO team will come
13:44  and make sure that that gets fixed and that it doesn't
13:46  happen again. So both of those were really incredible learning
13:50  experiences. I had the most amazing mentors. The programme
13:54  is incredible and if you've ever watched the internship, the
13:57  movie, it's very much like that, everything's free. I put on
14:00  quite a few kilos that summer, just eating, there's so much
14:04  food, but it was an incredible learning experience and that's
14:07  really what you take away from it. And then I'm currently at
14:10  Apple and that is a completely different experience. So this
14:14  one's a bit longer, it's six months instead of three, and
14:17  I've really gotten to experience the whole software lifecycle. So
14:21  when I joined they basically said find a problem in our
14:23  office and fix it, and that was it and so that's very vague,
14:27  you have to work through a lot of ambiguity but I got there.
14:31  You sort of start breaking up the pieces little by little and
14:34  eventually you get there. And so I'm about two and a half months
14:37  in and I've got my idea and I figured out the problem and I
14:41  can really justify that. And so that's also part of the software
14:44  experience, is finding the problems you want to fix and
14:47  figuring out, are they really going to benefit people and
14:50  being able to justify that as a means of is it worth creating?
14:54  And so that's been the best learning experience so far for
14:57  me. I think, software engineering, you think of coding but, but really
15:01  thinking about the whole software lifecycle and how you
15:04  create these products, what are you creating, has been really,
15:07  really incredible for me. So that's all about me. Let me know
15:11  if you have any questions and I'll answer them in the chat.
15:13  But I'll pass over back to Amir.
15:16  Thank you so much for that Jasmine, that's a really cool
15:18  story. You had a really cool University career, it seems
15:22  Awesome, so. Okay, we'll go to the next step. HSC subject
15:27  selection. So what specifically do you need? UTS does not have
15:32  any prerequisites, we do recommend maths, extension one,
15:37  and advanced English as well as Physics for all engineering
15:40  courses but we don't assume you have any IPT or software design
15:44  development, although that does help. So, adjustment points.
15:50  These are points, that as you guys know, are added to your raw ATAR.
15:54  So, UTS does give up to 13 adjustment points. That is,
15:58  including from completing the UTS engineering and IT
16:01  questionnaire, which is how I personally got in; good results
16:04  from, you know, relatively relevant HSC subjects; gender as
16:09  well as special considerations such as COVID, and more. Yeah,
16:14  awesome. So this is the university application process.
16:18  I know it might be a lot to take in, of course, you guys will get
16:21  these slides at the end so you can have a thorough read, but
16:25  essentially, how this works is we've got Open Day coming up
16:29  August 28. Our scholarship applications are currently open
16:33  so you can check out and see if you have any scholarships you
16:36  might be eligible for. Awesome news is that the UTS courses are
16:41  now on UAC so you can actually go into UAC now and select your
16:44  courses and see what's going on there and of course,
16:49  early offers are given out January to August. Now, as many
16:52  of you guys know, because a lot of the attendees are from Year 12,
16:57  the HSC is September to November. However, from December all the
17:01  way to March, there are different rounds that UAC
17:04  offers for, you know, any courses that you've applied for. So you
17:10  can of course change your preferences if you don't get
17:12  in in the first or second round. So, next is student
17:17  support. So some of you may be asking, well, what if I don't
17:20  know maths or physics or etc? So we do have bridging courses
17:25  offered for maths and physics as well as chemistry. So yeah,
17:30  that's something you guys can consider. I personally did a
17:33  physics bridging course. It was a few weeks before my first
17:36  semester and it really kept me up to speed. Then of course,
17:40  you've got your U:PASS, which is Pier Assisted Study Success. So
17:43  essentially, someone from a semester or two before from a
17:47  subject helps you out with the subject if you have any
17:50  questions and of course you've always got tutors and lecturers
17:53  that will help you understand anything. And finally, just to
17:58  connect digitally, this is some ways you can access us if you
18:02  have any questions engineering@uts.edu.au or feit@uts.edu.au or via 
18:07  our socials.

engineering,https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/short-courses/uts-institute-data-intensive-courses/institute-data-learner-perspectives,"Airline Pilot – Dominique Cotte successfully transitioned her career during COVID-19 to the cyber security industry by becoming trained through our part-time cyber security program.
Prior to pursuing studies with the Institute of Data, I was an International wide-body jet pilot for Emirates Airline – 4 years on Boeing 777. I’ve also flown for Tigerair Australia. My career over the past 17 years has been in the aviation industry. In terms of prior qualifications, I have a bachelor’s in aviation technology from Swinburn Hawthorn.
I was introduced to IoD’s Cybersecurity program through my sister actually – she is a travel agent for cricket in Australia who recommended it to me. I thought it was a great transition from aviation especially due to my experiences in risk management, threat & error management, and critical thinking ability. In addition, my previous focus on international standards, regulation and safety management was very helpful in my career transition.
I was always interested in moving into coding or studying another career path alongside my aviation career. The pandemic consolidated my need for this. Cybersecurity was also thriving during the pandemic! There were so many jobs becoming available worldwide, revealing a great opportunity for myself and many others
I did find that my lack of IT and cyber past experience was a challenge. I had great practical knowledge gained from the Institute of Data program, however for a few months, I was rejected and did not have any interview opportunities. My breakthrough was when I personally reached out to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of Qantas. We established a great relationship over time and she provided me guidance and insight into how I could position myself better in job application from the perspective of a Cyber Security professional. Due to this, I did land the opportunity with QBE. It definitely helps having the right connections. What is also important is being open & proactive to receiving guidance from professionals who can help you find a job in the industry.
There are numerous ways individuals can prepare for a Cyber Security interview. Here are a few tips that I would suggest:
Learn more and explore roles in cyber security here and here.
It has been a humbling experience starting a completely new career. I have had to develop skill sets I haven’t used in some time and face new challenges. I’ve realised there is a lot of room to grow and develop within Cybersecurity. With hard work, I’m determined and driven to learn as much as I can. I definitely have a better work/life balance compared to my time working as an airline pilot. Now, I can come home, spend time with friends and family far more often and have more stability in my life.
My capstone project was focused on a suggestion my lead trainer gave me. It was suggested for me to base my project around something that I wanted to work in – for me, I wanted to work in risk. I really enjoyed the process – it honestly surprised me how much I had learned about the topic from the moment I started to the moment I presented it in class. It was a great opportunity to hone my studies in an area I was motivated in. It also made my capstone project far more interesting.
The program gave me far more clarity and understanding about the industry, where Cybersecurity is heading in the future and modern day threats associated with technology advances. It also gave me a great insight into where my strengths lie and how I could utilise my strengths in the Cyber Security space. The program also taught me how to develop and learn the required practical skills for the job. Many of the technical and interpersonal skills that were taught to me were actually very applicable and relevant.
I enjoyed the challenge of learning and up-skilling especially as a mature age student. I learned so much from my counterparts, and loved the community we created throughout the program. I felt supported by our trainers and learned so much. They put in extra time to support each one of us throughout the course which I am very grateful for. Their guidance allowed me to understand every component of the program as we progressed.
If you are interested in up-skilling and landing a role in the Cyber Security industry, book a consultation with a Data Industry Career Consultant today.
The travel industry sadly ground to a halt with the onslaught of COVID19. I saw the fast-growing cyber security industry offering an exciting, interesting and challenging work scape so I made the pivot. Cybersecurity has a skills shortage and needs diversity in professionals who can bring open-mindedness, unique thinking and experiences as well as much needed soft skills to bring cyber awareness out of the basement and into the board room.
What I’ve enjoyed the most is seeing where business goals and cybersecurity intersect to support risk strategies and enable businesses to grow with confidence. My trainer Michael is instrumental in bringing real world experiences to the classroom, helping me to see past the theory and into the office with everything I’ve learned.
I’m excited and grateful for the opportunity to join Triskele Labs. I began looking at cybersecurity jobs when I started the course. My advice is, don’t wait until you’re finished. When I decide to pursue something, there’s no looking back - no hesitation, just discovery, delivery and drive. I made the effort to ask lots of questions and unpack all the areas of cybersecurity. I began to see where my strengths and experiences leant best. When I started applying for jobs and had discussions with people in the industry, I became aware of the difficulty to break into cyber security. For all that there’s a skills shortage and our industry’s in need, it’s a challenging one to start out in. I believe in living for your work and not working to live....
To join the cyber industry, you need to push yourself to get a foot in the door and craft how you can grow and pivot. My advice to anyone joining the industry is; before you know what you want to do, you need to know who you are. Start with that - define who you are, let that grow into who you want to be. From there, you can start to answer where you want to be in your professional life. It’s a lot easier to pinpoint the how from there. Be ready to shift your perceptions and assumptions. The industry has opportunities for people from all sorts of backgrounds. Wherever you’re coming from, you need to be able to break down what you’re good at into key components and demonstrate how they are relatable, transferable or complementary to the cybersecurity industry. Be self-aware to know how to deliver.
Lastly, talk to as many cybersecurity folks as you can. Network, connect and have conversations. The greatest thing to propel you in the industry will be your peers. No amount of qualifications, hours or skills will make you better than someone who can develop great relationships.
It’s all about Level of Preparation. Dial it up to 11. Off the chart. If you don’t feel over prepared, you’re not ready. Make sure you can articulate your story. Have a clear understanding of who you are, what you want, why you want it, where you’re going, what you can contribute and what you’re willing to do to make it work.
Know as much about your prospective employer, company and its staff as you can. You need to know who you are interviewing for. I make sure I’m interviewing the employer as well. They need to be the right fit for me too. In line with who I am, supportive of my ambition and direction as well as share a mutual belief of possibilities.
Enrol in the Institute of Data cyber program with UTS today. But be open minded, round out your learning- make it interactive, structured, self-driven and connected. Build solid relationships with peers and other professionals. Always be clear on your intentions. Someone will be willing to help if you can demonstrate a desire to help yourself.
Six months ago, all I saw was the crash-landing travel industry. Now, I see more possibilities than ever before. One of the exciting things about the beginning of this journey is that there’s such an incredible opportunity to learn, grow and move within the cyber industry. From roles that are super technical, to people focused and everything in between.
The course validated there isn’t a pre-requisite amount of technical skill to start your cyber journey. One thing increasingly clear is that there is not a ‘type’, ‘one best way’ or ‘one size fits all’ for what’s required. Curiosity goes a long way. Be ready to work really hard and know there’s a great reward in doing so.
If you are interested in up-skilling and landing a role in the Cyber Security industry, book a consultation with a Data Industry Career Consultant today.
My career background is predominantly in the IT space – as a COBOL developer and application development team leader & manager. I have been self employed for a few years prior to up-skilling with this program – running my own business on Amazon and publishing books over the years. I do also have a diploma in management – PMP (PMI).
Prior to up-skilling, I didn’t have any concrete career goals. I was working for myself for some time and was more aiming for a change in my career path – hence why I transitioned my career.
The reason why I chose the part-time program is because I had other commitments that did clash with the full-time program, it allowed me to balance everything in my life easier. Part-time class hours suited my schedule better. In hindsight, I could have stretched myself to complete the full-time course though.
I landed the new role through many, many applications, sending emails with expressions of interest, contacting local MPs, and even contacting previous employers from Ireland. It was through my own hard efforts as well as the practical skills & careers guidance that I was able to land the position at the end of the day.
I sent an EOI for a role that I actually didn’t qualify for – they wanted an Australian citizenship which I don’t have. I did mention this in my letter. Thankfully, they actually had other positions in the company that didn’t need citizenship! It was a great learning experience because it made me realise I need to be creative, not be blinkered in what I’m applying for, and focus on the roles and/or companies that I’d like to work for – not just the role. That would be what I would suggest to other people who are applying for cybersecurity positions.
I am way better off! I’m employed now, previously was not employed. I’m really loving my experience with the company and looking forward to growing in my new sphere of experience over the next 6-12 months.
One thing I wish I knew before changing careers to cyber was how vast the industry is! It may have helped if I had narrowed down where I did want to land-up in.
My particular project was difficult because there was very little documentation on SD. I managed to get the proof on concept, load all the existing rules, and execute various tests. However, without the documentation available, I could not find specifically how the rules were interpreted or worked. It taught me that some tools are not necessarily the be-all-and-end-all. If one doesn’t fit the bill, then try others. Time constraints in my case, prevented that. I gained valuable presentation and reporting skills out of the project.
I enjoyed the scope of areas the program covered, and therefore the variety of skills to learn. I also enjoyed being in a position to learn as much as I can to protect myself and others from potential cyber attacks.

Each separate module is delivered though a half-day virtual classroom session. The modules can be combined and customised depending on the context, needs and priorities of you and your team.
This course is intended for professional engineers and decision makers. 
After completing all of the modules in this series you will be able to:
Each module is offered as a half-day virtual classroom session, these modules can be combined and customised depending on the training needs of you and your team. 
Electric vehicles (EVs) are the future of transportation and their usage is increasing significantly worldwide. The uptake of EVs are an essential part of the energy transition strategy, which will result in significant changes for vehicle manufacturers, government, companies and individuals. In this module, you will be given a comprehensive overview of the technology of electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and electric mobility. You will develop a deeper fundamental understanding of the technology behind electric cars, electrical machines, charging technology, infrastructure and the role of electric vehicles in the energy transition strategy.
The integration of small-scale renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind energy, has increased significantly in developed countries including Australia, however the variability of wind and solar power does not fully correspond with demand, and can create challenges associated with reliability and economic viability. Advanced power electronic converters and controllers are required to ensure the resilient operation of power systems with large-scale renewable energy sources and microgrids. This module will provide an overview of the technological advancements in renewable energy systems, microgrids, smart power electronics interfaces and controls for managing the impacts of integrating large-scale renewable sources. 
Smart and active distribution systems will play a key role in the future of smart grids with emerging technologies such as distributed generation, renewable energy, microgrid and consumer engagement. This module looks at the challenges associated with the planning, engineering, design and operation of electrical distribution systems and smart grid systems.
Smart grids will be a major contributor to next generation electricity grids, with secure communication systems, optimised operation and advanced control. The implementation and management of smart grids requires a number of new tools and techniques. This module is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary for designing, analysing and controlling smart grids with secure communication systems. You will also acquire knowledge in cyber-physical systems, IoT enabled fault tolerance and dependable control.
With the deep penetration of renewable energy generation and emerging distributed energy management technologies, there are significant opportunities to modernise the current grid towards the smart grid to improve its efficiency and performance through market-based transactive exchanges between energy producers and energy consumers. This module looks at the concepts and frameworks associated with transactive energy as a new economic tool, and explores the potential of transactive energy to improve the resilience, safety, efficiency, reliability and adaptability of the grid. 
Technological developments have significantly impacted energy storage systems, which have gained wider adoption in power systems to facilitate the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources, improve power quality and increase both energy and power densities. Developments in this area are largely due to the availability of new materials, improved power and energy management technologies and requirements resulting from more challenging working environments. This module provides an overview of the latest technologies and applications associated with batteries, supercapacitors and superconductors.
Power electronics converters play an essential role in today’s power grids and will undoubtedly be a key enabling technology in next generation power systems. Currently there is a need to integrate more renewable energy sources and energy storage sources to the power grid, while increasing its reliability. In this new context, power electronics technology is vital in the modernisation of the power grid. At the transmission level, power converters provide flexibility to the grid in terms of power flow control, voltage regulation/reactive power injection control, and HVDC power transmission. At the distribution level, power converters can be used for load compensation, harmonic reduction, dynamic voltage support, distributed energy resources, energy storage systems and microgrids. This module is designed to provide you with the necessary knowledge and skills on power electronics operations and control in order to satisfy the needs of next generation power systems.

Here at UTS we offer a combined degree of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
Electronics and electrical complement each other, so you will be, after graduation, you will be skilled, for example, for jobs relevant to electrical as well as to electronics, and nowadays problems are complicated; you need to have that kind of multi-disciplinary skills to address real world challenges
0:45Dr Dushmantha Thalakotuna - Senior Lecturer School of Electrical and Data Engineering
In the workplace you work in teams; and you work with Engineers, Project Managers, Architects, different roles. And in the studios, students work in a group as well. They actually train for what they're going to do in the industry.
0:59Dr Negin Shariati - Senior Lecturer School of Electrical and Data Engineering
They can be more creative, I mean, in a studio because it has a research flavour as well. It's not about a traditional subjects, just going to the lecture room and gain some knowledge. It's a two way learning experience.
1:14Navil Burhan Uddin - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Electrical Engineering student
In a traditional subject we are given a set of, like, instructions to follow. We follow that for our projects, but in the studio subjects our projects are more open. Open in the sense that we decide what we want to do, regarding with that theory of that subject.
1:29Sahil Deep Singh - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Electrical Engineering student
It's more interesting. You can see the actually, practically, more. Like they give you better opportunity to learn how the things working as compared to the normal subjects. Just more benefits and opportunity to the students to learn better.
1:44Hayden Keers - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Electrical and Electronic Engineering student
And at the end of it, you have this video of something that you've made that you can then go to employers and say, ""Hey, I've made this. I know how to do this.""
The biggest reason why I chose UTS over other institutions would be the integrated internships as part of the degree. I wanted to have that experience when I left my degree to kind of be 'A Cut Above the Rest' in terms of who I was competing with jobs for.
2:08Erica Howell - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Electrical and Electronic Engineering student
I'm currently doing a paid internship with Boeing Defense Australia, within the avionics sustainment field, doing process based work to make sure that planes keep flying.

engineering,https://www.uts.edu.au/study/engineering/courses/electrical-and-data-science-engineering-majors/meet-dhruv-electrical-engineering-student,"Electricity powers the world around us and is core to the future of engineering and technology. Taking inspiration from a Year 9 Electrical elective, Dhruv chose to major in Electrical Engineering to future-proof his career opportunities through practical and hands-on learning and contribute to our changing world.
Dhruv’s journey to engineering was ignited by his curiosity to this field at a young age. “My dad is an engineer. I was always interested to learn what he did at work”. 
Whilst he was certain about studying engineering, Dhruv was unsure about which major he would pursue. However, Dhruv recalled studying an electrical subject in Year 9 as an elective. “I really enjoyed that subject and its practical element such as making circuits, and I was really looking for that hands-on approach to study when considering my major”. Dhruv also felt that Electrical Engineering was a future-focused major and would set him up for success. ""Technology moves at such a rapid pace, but electricity is always at centre of technology and powers the world around us. It is crucial to so many elements of our society, and I felt Electrical Engineering would also give me a variety of career opportunities to explore in the future.”  
Dhruv also decided to study a business management degree together with his engineering degree with the hope that he would be set up for a future in management. He believed that the dual-degree approach would enhance his skill set preparing him for various roles in the future.
Engineering Undergraduate Courses Guide (PDF, 7.2MB)
When choosing UTS for his Electronic Engineering major, Dhruv was drawn to the hands-on and practical approach on campus. “I like being challenged to think differently, and I get the freedom to do that in my engineering subjects. We also get access to some great facilities like the UTS Robotics Institute where I get to experience real-life working equipment that I wouldn’t get anywhere else”.  
In 2nd year, Dhruv worked with other engineering students for the UTS Rover Team project that saw him design rovers to be launched on the moon. “It was so cool to be a part of something space-related that combined so well with my degree. We got to use some really high-end equipment that I would have otherwise not had the chance to experience”. In his third year, Dhruv joined the UTS Aerospace Society where he took part in the Spaghetti and Space launch project that involved building a high altitude balloon that travelled 25kms into space with a plate of spaghetti. “It was such a great project and received so much attention across Australia. It felt like a fever dream!”. Having taken part in these experiences, Dhruv believes they have helped complement his skills learnt within his studies and explore different facets of engineering.  
I really love UTS’ hands-on and collaborative approach to learning. It makes so much sense, especially during excursions or when working on practical projects through the students’ clubs and societies. 
""I also appreciate the university’s willingness to employ students on campus through the Student Promotional Representatives (SPROUT) program which I am a part of where we can inspire other potential students to study degrees like Electrical Engineering that they may not have considered.”  
As a part of his Electrical Engineering major, Dhruv has had the chance to gain industry exposure and make connections through internships. “I am interning for Alstom, who work closely on the Sydney Light Rail and Sydney Metro projects. I am specifically working on the Sydney Trains project”. Working with a close team of experienced Engineers, Dhruv has received practical experience and is able to contribute to real-world projects that keep the Sydney rail network running. ""I have physically contributed to the traction maintenance of the Millenium fleet commissioned in the early 2000s working with a close team of experienced engineers. I’m involved in the repairs and get the chance to work on projects that are meaningful.  
Dhruv believes that engineering enthusiasts should explore their passion, and not be afraid to explore their options. 
It’s a common misconception that Electrical Engineering is very difficult and math-heavy. Don’t just rule out a major because you’ve heard that it’s difficult. If you have a passion for it and are looking for solid graduate opportunities and a community to be a part of, Electrical Engineering is a great major to pursue.
Dhruv attributes his academic journey’s success to his ability to be involved in extracurricular projects. “I would say be as productive and proactive as possible in your degree. Try as many things as possible and find your niche”.
The Electrical Engineering major is offered to undergraduate students and can be paired with an Engineering degree.

When Palvi was in her final year of school, she felt as if her friends had their study path figured out. “I didn’t really know what I wanted to study for a long time. I’ve always felt that I’ve been an all-rounder in school and took that open-minded approach into making a decision on a degree”. Palvi took a process of elimination approach to land on her Data Science Engineering degree. “I had to force myself to explore the courses available as applications at universities were about to close. I read course guides as I tried to identify which course would suit the subjects I was passionate about being math and physics.  I stumbled upon Engineering as my core degree”  
When picking her major, Palvi came across Data Science Engineering. Despite not knowing much about the major, she knew she was up for a challenge and decided to research further on what it involved. “Further research on this major made me appreciate the growing nature of data engineering. I hadn’t heard much exposure to anything related to my major in the past, but I felt that the field was growing and it was very future-focused which grabbed my attention”.  
Despite lacking prior technical knowledge, Palvi embraced the opportunity to study technology in a completely unfamiliar domain. “We were not offered ""techy"" kind of subjects at school; we were very humanities-based. So, everything I studied from the first semester at uni was new to me. But I love a challenge and I get the best feeling out of it in the end.”  
When asked how she would explain Data Science Engineering to someone with no prior knowledge of it, Palvi assures that it’s simpler than it sounds. 
Everything around us in the world is built or affected by data. It’s everywhere, and it has the potential to make a difference in the world. Data Science Engineering involves creating and managing systems to service the data in our world. It’s all about leveraging the power and potential data has to make a difference.
Palvi is currently interning at Woolworths Group. The opportunities not only enhanced her knowledge but also helped to refine her career aspirations. “Internships are such fantastic ways to build your skills both in technical and non-technical aspects. I found that my internships allowed me to work in areas of Data Science Engineering that I wouldn’t have otherwise pursued. It’s a benefit that not many people talk about, but it means I don’t have any unchartered career territories within the industry”.
Participating in mentorship programs, like the Lucy Mentoring program, also highlighted a proactive approach to seeking guidance and insights from experienced professionals. These interactions also enabled her to see the importance of promoting gender diversity in traditionally male-dominated fields like engineering. 
The Lucy Mentoring Program has allowed me to connect with so many like-minded women from different Engineering backgrounds. It’s provided me with perspective.  
Palvi is also a Women in Engineering and IT Co-Operative Scholarship recipient and explains this achievement as life-changing as it provided her with more opportunities to network, and grow her confidence in this field. “Data Science Engineering is such an amazing study path for what it is. Having the scholarship awarded on top of that has presented me with even more opportunities to network, but mostly the growth in my confidence since the start of my journey has been astronomical”.   
Palvi says the most surprising part of her degree was that she didn’t feel she needed to have any prior knowledge in Data Science Engineering to succeed. “There’s a beauty to learning as you go. How hard can it be if you don’t ever try it out? Don’t feel you need to over-prepare for the unknown. The learning curve is real, but it’s rewarding when you get to the top”. 
Palvi also credits her study experience to her ability to push herself enough to take on the opportunities that come her way. “You will gain more if you learn to embrace opportunities that come your way. I would tell my younger self the same advice because that is how you grow outside your comfort zone. Everything will work out if you put in the effort and stay in the present.”

The difference between Data Science and Data Engineering is that Data Science deals with the analysis of the data. The Data Engineers instead build all the infrastructure that is needed by the Data Scientists. The infrastructure entails software pipelines; entails preparing storage; entails preparing a number of things that the Data Scientists rely on to do their job.
Data Engineering is a profession that requires access and experience with a number of components of the IT pipeline. That means access to storage; access to fast computing; access to distributed computing, and at UTS we offer all of that in different degrees, and different versions, to students in the different stages in career.
0:52Olivia Ju - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Data Science Engineering student
I just really like the flexibility that this program provides. I get to choose what honestly interests me, and what inspires me to do what I'm majoring, I guess. So Data Engineering, I really like the coding aspect of it; the development; the back end infrastructure. Not a lot of subjects in universities, in general, just offer such group work based projects.
So definitely it has increased my soft skills as well technical skills. I did build upon them, but in terms of soft skills, like my communication; my confidence; my ability to just communicate with people, has definitely, I could see an improvement.
1:24Professor Massimo Piccardi - School of Electrical and Data Engineering
Internships are a very important component of the formative part of the students. They're more adult so depending on specific offering from industry, from companies, we compile them and we pass them on to students, and students can then choose from those internships something that is close to their heart and they engage in those.
1:44Robert Joyce - Chief Technology Officer, Nokia Oceania
One thing employers look for on a CV is experience, as well as a good academic record, and I think internships,for me, really tick the box in at least having some industrial experience before graduation.
So Nokia, we do offer internships. I have a girl that works in my department at the moment. She's working on some machine vision project and she's actually looking at the safety of rail tracks using computer vision.
2:14Rohith Gajangi - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Data Science Engineering student
In my placements, I've done one as a full stack software developer, and then a software engineer and a data analyst. These are all different roles. I got a broad exposure to all of them across my placements.
My most recent internship was for a tech company called ServiceNow, and after the internship I've got on as a full time site reliability engineer there.
2:43Professor Massimo Piccardi - School of Electrical and Data Engineering
So, my advice to a student who is interested in Data Engineering would be to read as much as possible. Anything they can come across, even informally; blogs online; some experience from friends, to understand more clearly what that Data Engineering degree would entail for them.
They can talk to us, as well. Anyone who's interested can come and ask for some informal advice for getting to have an understanding, as early as possible, is good to guide your choices.

engineering,https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/short-courses/why-short-courses/5-tech-trends-2024,"Even as new technologies are developed, innovation around the application of existing technology is rapidly changing how organisations operate and how we interact with the world. Leaps in computing capacity, data capture and connectivity are accelerating this change. Here are five areas to watch in 2024 and beyond…
AI is about machines with human attributes - speaking, reading, seeing and even recognising emotion - completing tasks while also ""learning"" from repeated interactions. Using algorithms that adapt to location, speech or user-history machines can perform tasks that are dangerous or tedious, more accurately or much faster than humans.
Within a few years, analysts predict that all software will use AI at some level, according to US research and advisory firm Gartner. Importantly AI offers the opportunity to continuously tailor products and services providing a competitive advantage over rivals that is not easily copied. The question to ask is 'how can AI help my organisation?
Systems that combine real-time 3D vision, sound, haptics (the sense of touch), location data and even other senses such as smell enable people to immerse themselves somewhere else, react to what's around them and alter their virtual environment in real-time. Organisations are increasingly applying this technology across a wide spectrum of human activity from art and entertainment to commerce, education and the military. It's used to train doctors, nurses, teachers and police officers and will soon be available on your smart device. Could you use AR to lift efficiency for your internal stakeholders or help you communicate with your customer base?
The fortunes of digital currency Bitcoin have drawn public attention to Blockchain technology, but this secure system for recording and verifying transactions and storing trusted records has the potential to disrupt enterprises of many kinds. Companies are using Blockchain technology to transform time-consuming, centralised, less reliable and less secure systems. Digital democracy platform MyVote, for example, uses Blockchain to store users' personal data and voting history to give citizens a more direct voice in the political process. Could you use Blockchain to keep your data secure?
Robots in manufacturing go back to the 1960s. Now it's the scale and breadth of the transformation that automated systems make possible, as a result of other advances in machine learning and connectivity, for example, that puts automation firmly at the forefront of technology trends. From convenient devices at home to industrial applications on a massive scale, automation will be a key focus of technological change, with potentially far-reaching economic and social consequences.
Currently, professional services such as the legal and finance industry are being disrupted by automation with feedback from these sectors being that core technical skills, together with management and people skills are more important than ever. How will automation disrupt your industry?
Gartner calls the combination of technologies and the connection of people, devices, content and services the ""intelligent digital mesh."" This is the foundation for new business models, platforms and possibilities that will transform how we live and work with implications that go far beyond the technology itself and involve disciplines such as law, economics, business and politics.
It is early days for the application of IoT strategy, but it is clear that opportunities will exist for those with the technical knowledge to connect platforms as well as those with the data analytics skills to utilise the rich stream of information generated by IoT applications. What could you learn from connecting and analysing the data from your products or elements of your core operations?
During a postgraduate degree at UTS, you'll develop the characteristics to help you be agile, look for opportunities to innovate and disrupt and be an effective project manager. You'll also have the opportunity to build technology expertise such as in data analytics, according to your interest.

It takes a lot more than just animators to make a 3D animated film. From story and art department, through modelling, rigging, animation, surfacing, effects, lighting, compositing, production and technical directing, hear about what each of these roles brings to each production, based on our most recent 3D animated short film ‘Apart’. 
These are all roles we are looking for when recruiting for the Master of Animation and Visualisation each year at the University of Technology Sydney. So if you would like to move from being a student, to becoming a specialist and landing a dedicated role in an animation or visual effects studio, consider joining our team of incredibly talented students in next years masters course.
It’s essential at undergraduate level that students develop broad knowledge and skill, but how do you translate these skills to a professional working environment? Here at the Academy we teach students at a postgraduate level so that they can further develop specialised skills in order to contribute at a high level to complex projects, and also to accelerate their entry and progression in industry.
Here are some of the key areas students can choose to specialise in as part of the production process when undertaking the Master of Animation and Visualisation.
The Art department starts with the original story idea then creates the visual look of the project.
The Modelling team takes designs and creates the characters, creatures, objects and assets as 3-dimensional computer models. 
Riggers create an interactive skeleton with integrated controls for models that enables them to be animated. 
Previz/Layout artists take the first raw elements from art department and animation, and create basic moving shots, including decisions about framing, lensing and camera movement.
Animation is the creation of performance from rigged models. Great animators typically have a strong understanding of gesturing, theatrics and performance.
Detailed texture and pattern artworks are produced to warp perfectly around 3D models to create the right photo-realistic or stylised look for each asset.
FX simulations are special effects that enhance shots and scenes, such as fire, explosions, dust, steam, sparks, or even fur or cloth simulations, crowds or cities. 
Lighting artists set detailed light sources to each shot to highlight the action, characters and emotion through the use of highlights and shadows.
Compositing is the process of combining all the various elements of the production into one final composited scene.
Production Coordinators ensure the project runs to schedule. It’s a great role for those who envision themselves in a project management or producer role.
Technical Directors are responsible for creating tools and maintaining the software and pipeline for the production of the animation and/or visual effects projects.

Students collaborating. Image: Toby Burrows
According to Chris Messina, who invented the idea of using hashtags, this means you're an agile employee who confidently navigates the technological landscape and understands the crossover between visual design (the look and feel), and interaction design (how the look and feel work).
Facing an overload of data, you can weed out relevance. You have specific expertise and yet you're abreast of other areas in the organisation. You embrace unfamiliar situations. You understand algorithms and coding, and you get what GitHub and StackOverflow mean. Self-sufficient and independent, you're always searching for best practices and improved productivity. You thrive on group collaboration and excel as part of a team.
Learning from the start-up scene, many corporations are investing time and money to foster ""intrapreneurship"". Apple, Sony, 3M, ING Direct, Coca-Cola, IBM, and Allianz are among many companies with innovation divisions. You may choose to dive into this type of role, with the passion and permission to disrupt an organisation from within.
A memorable example of intrapreneurship is Google. The company encourages employees to spend 20 percent of their time working on ""what they think will most benefit Google"". This led to employees developing Google News, Gmail and AdSense.
According to Jeff Collins, president of the Dallas-based Innovative Management Solutions, to be a project manager communication skills are the key characteristic you need. You'll know how to share your clear vision and important information with team members so they buy into the project's goals and purpose.
Also, you'll display confidence, positivity and enthusiasm for the project while remaining level-headed and composed, embracing problems and leading by example. You'll delegate responsibilities and tasks, giving team members a chance to thrive and grow while not micromanaging their progress.
Big data is growing rapidly and many companies struggle to keep up. Knowing how to extract data, analyse it and look for patterns are skills that can improve the use of resources, value chains, managerial operations, industry knowledge and growth opportunities.
Data analysts are in big demand across all sectors. International research and advisory firm Forrester also predicts a significant rise in companies hiring Chief Data Officers. Businesses need them across their operations, including finance, human resources and marketing.
During your postgraduate degree at UTS, you'll develop the characteristics to help you be agile, look for opportunities to innovate and disrupt and be an effective project manager. You'll also have the opportunity to build technology expertise such as in data analytics according to your interest.

Mechatronic engineers use a combination of mechanical, electronics, computer systems, and software engineering to design and build mechanical systems and their controllers, software, and hardware, plus electronic processes and the networks which link them.
You’ll study dynamics (the science of moving things) and learn to calculate and control the movement and interaction of solid objects and electricity. You’ll also learn to design, build, and manage automated and autonomous mechanical systems, with an emphasis on robots, micro and nanoscale machines, automatic and intelligent control systems, and biomedical devices.

You’re also likely to work closely with electrical, mechanical, and software engineers, and will find opportunities in many of the areas suggested for those majors.
Well mechatronics is what you can call the robotics as well.  The students basically learn about how to program microcontrollers how to work with the actuators, how to work with the sensors.
How to do control, how to do programming so we created an environment for them to work on their projects while we are mentoring.
At the same time I wanted to add a bit more excitement to it by introducing a competition to assess the performance so there's code completion based assessment the particular subject that I was talking about is called mechatronics two - what you are basically doing is trying to create opportunities for the students to learn robotics or mechatronics in a fun way.
You decide the way that you want to how you want to go there. But in order to go there these are the skill sets needed. We provide some information about it and we teach them how to get that information. We mentor them so in that way they will have more time to think, time to innovate. It is going beyond the boundaries of this class. So the students are now self-motivated to do their own project.
Also they have now created their own robotic society where they basically manage their own projects. They are facilitating workshop for all other students who are maybe first years or have very limited knowledge in robotics. I see that they are growing as lifelong learners I believe that is what I am really proud of.

A trip to Adelaide to witness a meeting of the world’s top minds in the field of space at the International Astronautical Congress, proved to be the inspiration behind the UTS Faculty of Engineering & IT Summer Studio - Global Aerospace Challenge led by fourth-year student, Gavan Huang.
“I think UTS has the right mindset when it comes to experiential learning and this is a point of difference when you choose to study here,” he said.
“Senior staff are accessible and open to students pitching their ideas which is a big plus when trying to get new initiatives off the ground.”
Gavan’s first step was to introduce the idea of a space subject to the Faculty’s Learning and Development team. This was met with a positive response together with the suggestion to test the waters at the UTS Summer Studio and so the Global Aerospace Challenge was born.
As Founder and President of the UTS Professional Aeronautics and Astronautics Society, Gavan is passionate about providing students with better access into the Australian Space Industry.
Through the Global Aerospace Challenge, he hoped to debunk the myth of space being a difficult topic and introduce people to the concept of space entrepreneurship.
“Students have the opportunity to work closely with industry stakeholders to build projects to solve problems the space industry faces today.”
“It’s about looking at the problems that exist in the world and using space technology to solve it – then creating a scalable business model which can sustain your solution, such as:
Gavan says the 10 participants kicked off their Global Aerospace Challenge by discussing their own space interests – from space colonisation to launch vehicles and asteroid mining.
“I wanted to take all the best aspects of uni learning and combine them into one so that we could deliver an inspiring studio workshop,” he said.
With the Australian Government announcing its intention to establish an Australian space agency, Gavan hopes the UTS Faculty of Engineering and IT is recognised as competitive in this field.
“The success of the Global Aerospace Challenge and the introduction of space subjects to our mainstream curriculum is a positive step forward as we continue to work towards UTS students becoming the future leaders of the space industry.” "

When fourth-year student Seamus O’Sullivan first learned about the UTS Summer Studios he thought it would be a chance to take on a hobby project during the holidays. He was also familiar with the Vivid festival and liked the idea of being part of practical collaboration that would result in something tangible at the end.
“With Vivid such a well-known event in Sydney, I thought the Vivid 2018 studio offered a cool opportunity to create something that I could relate to myself,” he said.
This studio was dedicated to the delivery of an interactive light installation for the vivid light festival– but that’s all the students were told.
The nine-strong team had to work closely together to research the entire project.
“The best thing about the studio is that we were able to lead the design ourselves, but with plenty of support and technical expertise from our tutors when we needed it,” Seamus said.
“We were responsible for all the decision-making as the project progressed and we got to learn a lot through this process.” 
“As well as great support from UTS tutors, you also get a chance to see what’s happening in other majors and get access to new facilities that you may not have needed to use before.”
For Seamus this included using the new UTS ProtoSpace for 3D printing as well as the Fabrication Labs for laser cutting. 
Seamus says the studio offers a different experience to term time study where you follow a standard pathway to meet course requirements. With the studio you’re working on a real-world project tackling real-world challenges along the way, such as:   
Seamus says the result of the studio was a strong prototype and design concept that can be scaled up in the future – and the project continues to live on!
“Our team has kept in touch and have the foundations to keep the momentum going on this project. The next step is to attract some funding and civil engineering expertise to the project so that we can have an installation ready for Vivid 2019 or 2020.”

This major is available in the following courses:
What is the difference between chemical engineering and chemical process engineering?
Both chemical engineering and chemical process engineering involve converting raw materials and energy into consumer products. The key difference is that chemical engineering will have a strong focus on chemical principles, while chemical process engineering will have a stronger industrial focus featuring operations and process design for a vast range of industries e.g. agriculture, mining, biotech, pharmaceutical and automotive.
Is chemical process engineering a good career choice for women?
The limiting factor for a CPE career is not gender but instead a passion for chemistry and doing innovative things with raw materials and energy! As such, CPE provides flexible and vast job opportunities and is a good fit for both male and female engineers ranging from laboratory scale chemical analysis up to field site mining engineering and offshore oil and gas process engineering.
