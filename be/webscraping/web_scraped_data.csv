UTS Business School's commitment to innovative teaching and learning is reflected in our state-of-the-art facilities. Our new learning spaces encourage collaboration and innovation in both formal and informal learning environments. Our facilities include flexible environments, informal learning spaces, group collaboration areas and social hubs. These collaboration areas are designed with a high level of connectivity, with large display screens and smart whiteboards that connect to students' laptops to enable clear and effective information sharing.
 
The spaces have been created as an interconnected environment, with everything from reading nooks to large conference-style areas, all fitted with power outlets for recharging batteries. The Sandpit, part of the award-winning Greenspace in Building 5, can be used either as an open space, or curtained off for privacy, while the Shed provides an indoor/outdoor environment with heating for the winter months.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/why-business-uts/practical-experience,"Practical experience is one of the core elements of teaching and learning throughout the University. At UTS Business School, we ensure each course is structured to allow relevant, practice-based assessment is conducted alongside theoretical learning and examination.
An elective in the Bachelors of Business and Economics, and compulsory in the Bachelors of Management and Accounting, internships are your best opportunity to put what you have learnt so far into practice, working on projects that add real value to client organisations and getting a real feel for what work in that industry is like. For information on our work placement programs, see our Internships page.
Each major or specialisation in the undergraduate programs involves completing a capstone subject, usually consisting primarily of an industry project. These subjects allow you to create work that is assessed at an industry level, and to contribute significant project outcomes to your professional portfolio.
A compulsory first year subject in the Bachelor of Business, IBP has been developed in response to calls from industry wanting graduates with a thorough understanding of how different business elements work together. Through IBP, you will get a taste of the different disciplines in the business degree as well as an understanding of ethical and sustainability issues as they relate to the role of business in society.
You will experience case studies throughout your degree, working on solving complex business problems with our partners. You may even find yourself presenting your solutions to industry panels including future employers.
In a number of subjects, you may be given real-world case studies that have been brought us by our industry partners and collaborators. This insight into the workings of the current issues facing the industry is invaluable, as you experience the application of skills and knowledge in a workplace scenario, but with the input and advice of peers and academic staff.
If you are currently working within your field of study, many subjects allow you to bring your own professional projects in as case studies

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/whats-it-really/international-opportunities,"At UTS, we believe that a global perspective is an intrinsic quality of academic life. With a large number of international students, multicultural student clubs and strong ties to institutions spanning five continents, there’s plenty to get involved with here in Sydney. But for those looking to roam further afield, there are a number of options available.
Combine your degree with a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies, and immerse yourself in a new language and culture. This unique degree offers unrivalled international academic experience, with students spending two semesters abroad studying at a host university as part of the International In-Country Study component. To find out more about combining your degree with International Studies, take a look at the International Studies course area in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, and at the available combined degrees with the Business School: the Bachelor of Business Bachelor of Arts in International Studies and the Bachelor of Management Bachelor of Arts in International Studies.
 Here’s how it works: In the first three years of your degree, you’ll be based at UTS where you’ll combine your business subjects with language and culture studies based on your chosen country major (pick from Argentina, Canada (Quebec), Chile, China, Columbia, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Latino USA, Mexico, Spain or Switzerland). Once you’ve skilled up, you’ll be ready to launch: you’ll spend your fourth year overseas, putting your language and cultural nous to the test. As well as gaining first-hand experience of life in another country – and accruing course credit while you travel – you’ll also have the chance to think about business in a global context. It’s great news for your degree, and even better news for your career: when you’re out looking for work, an international experience can make you even more attractive to prospective employers. 
The international aspect was the most straightforward and the most focused on delivering a genuine international experience, compared to all similar courses. Upon jumping into the Business and International Studies program it became even more apparent how focused the uni is on international awareness, with many different options available for travel, such as BUILD travel grants and AIESEC overseas internships.- Aaron Ngan, Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of Arts in International Studies
Why not make a global exchange part of your degree? Use 4 elective subjects to complete study for a session through our Global Exchange or Study Abroad programs. With over 240 exchange partners in over 40 countries and territories, UTS has one of the largest international exchange programs in Australia. 
The Diploma in Languages is a concurrent degree that can be taken alongside your degree. Engage with the in-depth study of your chosen culture, and choose from six language options - Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese or Spanish. The Diploma of Language doesn’t require you to study overseas but can be a great complement to an exchange program and doesn’t have to add any time onto your degree.
Extend your global learning beyond travel and start building your global mindset with UTS BUILD. BUILD (Beyond UTS International Leadership Development) is an extra-curricular global leadership program with a mission to develop self-aware, informed and active global citizens and leaders. Starting with your identity as a global citizen, the program exposes you to global issues and ideas and develops your leadership skills to deliver positive global impact. Participate in interactive workshops, learn from inspiring speakers, join field trips, community activities and much more. Include an immersive overseas experience through Global Short Programs, Global Exchange or In-Country Studies to help you put your learning into practice. All these experiences earn points towards your completion. In addition to a completion certificate, the program is recognised on your Australian Higher Education Graduation Statement (AHEGS).
Go global during your session break 
UTS Global Short Programs offers students the ability to experience a short-term overseas or virtual program during the university session break. These programs allow students to experience other cultures whilst cultivating new perspectives and learning a broad range of skills that will help them thrive in the future.
Students can choose to make their UTS experience more international by attending summer or winter schools at partner universities, engaging in experiential learning programs, or completing an international internship. All Global Short Programs have been approved by faculties, and eligible students can receive academic credit and financial assistance.
You can complete an overseas internship with one of our international partner institutions and count it for the Business Internship subject, or use an elective subject to study in a short term program at an overseas university. UTS Business School also offers a 6 week Jakarta Internship Program with a focus on Business leadership & entrepreneurship.
By the end of the program, I felt I had matured and established new connections and skills that I find myself constantly applying in work and study. To make the most of an experience like this, always have an open mind and be ready to adapt. Having cultural understanding and empathy was so important in letting me develop relationships ... which enhanced my experience greatly.- Rianna Darby, Jakarta Intern, Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of Arts in International Studies"

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/information-technology/student-experience/careers-and-employment,"The demand for skilled IT professionals is growing exponentially to meet emerging tech trends. Check out the jobs in demand and predicted to grow in the future.
Technology continues to infiltrate every aspect of our lives, and there’s no signs of it slowing down. Your IT degree will prepare you for a fast-paced digital future, giving you the knowledge and developing the skills you need for any industry or your own start-up.
Today, IT professionals are programming, networking, analysing and building. They're pioneering business and technical solutions for computer hardware, software, electronics, the Internet, telecommunications, e-commerce and computer services. And they're often disrupting today and delivering the technology of tomorrow.
If you’re interested in working in technology, the opportunities are endless. In fact, the IT sector is one of the biggest contributors to Australia’s national economy with predicted growth until 2020.
Software developers are the creative minds behind computer programs and algorithms. The programs must be secure and continuously tested to ensure code is released consistently, at a high quality and fast, ensuring clients and customers have a seamless and safe experience across applications.
Smart solutions, robots, machine learning, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and advanced enterprise solutions are increasing the demand for custom software solutions.
Advances in inter-connectivity, smart technology and online services are increasing the chances of cyber threats. In fact, according to the 2016 PwC Global
Economic Crime Survey, cybercrime is ranked second most reported economic crime in the world.
Cyber security experts are tasked with simulating, tracking and targeting hackers.
The Internet of Things is predicted to have 50 billion ‘things’ connected to the net by 2020. These ‘things’ include mobile phones, home appliances, healthcare devices, lights, wearable devices, engines and machinery.
As the demand for data grows, so will the demand for data analysts. An analyst has deep analytical skills with an ability to identify patterns and draw conclusions and
insights to inform business decisions.
The world of virtual and augmented reality is changing fast and becoming more accessible and wide-spread. Aside from the gaming industry, VR is also being used in the engineering, architecture, construction, education, medical and military industry for 3D design, simulations and training.
AI is enhancing human decision-making, by powering computer systems with human intelligence. This includes machine learning, where humans teach computer programs to learn by finding patterns in data. The more data available, the better the performance!
For instance, Google Assistant recognises your speech, provides search results and gives you recommendations on music and movies according to your search history. Clinicians are also benefiting from AI by using complex pattern recognition to determine tailored treatments for patients, using billions of dimensions of DNA.
As technology advances and AI breakthroughs occur, we can expect further integration into our daily lives. Think automated transport, social robots, virtual personal assistants and advanced health detection.

To enable this, UTS IT courses are offered in conjunction with the Diploma in Information Technology Professional Practice. 
Simply put, it's an internship. With the Diploma in Information Technology Professional Practice, you complete a minimum of 9 months' work experience before you graduate. Completing an internship allows you to integrate what you're learning in the classroom into a work environment.
Practical experience in the workplace is a great way to learn. Students find that they perform better in their subjects after completing their internship, meaning they contribute more to class and bring their work experience to their academic learning. There are many other benefits, including:
You'll need to manage your own internships; however, the faculty Work Integrated Learning Team (internships) and UTS Careers Team can assist you with this process. The teams maintain
 links with more than 1000 organisations offering both scholarships and internships. They also offer opportunities to find mentors, meet contacts, and build networks that are invaluable for your future career.

Students studying a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Diploma in Information Technology Professional Practice usually complete their internship during the third year of their full-time course.

Text: Jessica La Rosa, Bachelor of Information TechnologyJessica: I chose to go on exchange because I wanted to experience a new culture and I wanted to make new friends from not just Italy but all different countries.The thing I like the most about Italy is that it has such an interesting culture. The Italians really love family and they’re very close, very friendly. That’s great also when you’re studying there because it was really easy to make friends.
Text: Kruti Joshi, Bachelor of Arts in Communication (Journalism)Kruti: The thing I liked the most on exchange, from being from India and then living here for twelve years, I’ve never seen snow so I thoroughly enjoyed that and I also quite liked the people I met, most of them were from Europe and it was amazing to think like its such a small place and it could have so many different cultures and languages.
Text: Chun Lam Ma ( James), Bachelor of Forensic Science in Applied ChemistryJames: The main reason I chose to go on exchange was that I really wanted to experience something that was very different from my home country, Singapore and Sydney and I’d like to experience something that is more diverse in terms of education base.
Text: Luke Fergus, Master of ArchitectureLuke: the opportunity to study architecture in Denmark is quite appealing and also the chance to study in another school especially in Europe. To see their sort of teaching style and how they go about things was also attractive.
Text: Bradley Sacks, Bachelor of BusinessBradley: I think the specific skill that I developed while I was on exchange was how to manage money and I also learnt how to live by myself. I have never lived away from home before. As a matter of fact I have never actually travelled overseas before without my parents. I also learned how to be more confident and interact with different people from different cultures.
Jessica: What I loved about the university was that the teachers were very, very helpful. The subjects were exactly what I wanted. I wanted to study Italian as the language and it was so great to learn from Italians themselves.
Kruti: the best thing I gained while I was on exchange was a lot of friends and a lot of new acquaintances. If I ever go back to Europe I know I’ll have a place to go to and a person I can rely on.
James: When you go on exchange you get a global perspective. You get more culture embedded in you and what I think is that this experience is one of a kind you can’t get it else where. So I really recommend students, international students to go on exchange. Just go for it.
Jessica: It can be a bit scary at first to make the decision to move to a country at first. I think its very valuable and it could be the best six months of your life. Once you’re there, you’ll learn so much and you’ll make friends of a life time. So I really encourage you to go on it.

UTS: Pharmacy
Sally Lui: The pharmacy profession is definitely moving towards health services, and I do find UTS do it really, really well.We're not just focusing on helping a patient manage their medication; although, we still do that. We actually help manage their whole disease condition. We can actually see how they progress as they come back to the pharmacy. They get their prescriptions filled. We can help monitor. It becomes a really close [00:00:30] relationship and a very ongoing relationship.
What I love most is patient interaction, being able to see them understanding the information they're actually telling them. It's great to actually see the changes in their lifestyle, and you're touched by their stories.
Look, I think pharmacy's a wonderful career. If you work hard, and you have a great attitude, you love working with people, [00:01:00] you can work well in a team, you'll come out of the degree, and there'll be jobs ready for you.
Absorb as much as you can. Ask questions. Tell us what you're interested in, tell us what you like. The more that we find that you're interested and engaged, the more we can offer and show you bits. You'll get so much more out.
Our course is a comprehensive two-year program (120 credit points = 108 credit points of core subjects + 12 credit points of electives) that allows for professional services education and electives. A full-time study load is four subjects plus half a day of clinical practice per semester, plus clinical placements in breaks.
You can expect to be on campus or at clinical placement five days per week during session and full-time two or four-week clinical placement blocks during breaks. Some students maintain part-time jobs in addition to their study. You will participate in clinically focused coursework, research training, and gain extensive experience during a range of clinical placements.
The program is offered as a full-time on-campus course and part-time and distance options are not available. All Graduate School of Health courses operates on Calendar B.
This program has been granted accreditation by the Australian Pharmacy Council and is approved by the Pharmacy Board of Australia as a qualification leading to registration as a pharmacist in Australia.
UTS Master of Pharmacy students benefit from individual mentoring under our Academic Mentorship Program. 
Students are assigned to an academic mentor who is charged with overseeing their progress. This innovative measure will make sure that you have the best possible chance for success in your program and start to build your professional network.

For our law students, it is an invaluable opportunity to develop intellectual, volunteer and leadership capacities.
1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,023
The Brennan Program is
a free voluntary Program,
2
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:05,671
driven by the ideals of
justice consciousness,
3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,789
idealism and a sense of service.
4
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:10,983
In accomplishing this award,
it developed students capacity
5
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:13,990
for professional and personal
leadership and service.
6
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:18,795
Since 2011, the Brennan Program
has accrued over 2,000 active members.
7
00:00:18,796 --> 00:00:21,616
My favourite part of it was probably
the connections that I made
8
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:22,827
and the people that I met.
9
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:25,070
My main goal in joining
the Brennan Program
10
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:27,225
was to get more involved
in social justice.
11
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:28,577
What I love about the Brendan Program
12
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:31,241
is I really got to meet
so many different people
13
00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:32,725
and do a wide
range of tasks, you know,
14
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:35,608
I was doing things from
volunteering at immigration centres
15
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,827
to helping the elderly use IT.
16
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:39,742
So, if you're a UTS law student,
17
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:41,695
I would suggest that
you just give it a go.
18
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:45,196
It's a fun, engaging
and diverse experience.
19
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:47,758
Being surrounded by
people who are driven
20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,742
and who really care about
social justice issues,
21
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:53,632
really inspired me as well
and it just reminded me that
22
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,625
it's possible to create a better world.

The Brennan Justice and Leadership Program (Brennan Program) was introduced in 2011 as a joint initiative of the UTS Faculty of Law and the UTS Law Students’ Society. It is named after Sir Gerard Brennan AC KBE GBS QC, former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia and UTS Chancellor (1999-2005). Sir Gerard’s life and career exemplified the qualities of professional leadership, service and excellence that the Program seeks to nurture.
The Brennan Program consists of two components:
To complete the program and qualify for the Brennan Justice and Leadership Award, student participants must accrue 100 Reflection on Justice points and Leadership Through Service hours according to the pro-rata allocation available in the Brennan Program Handbook.
The Reflections on Justice component is designed to stimulate an intellectual engagement with the idea of justice to continue across your studies of law and beyond, and generate a group conversation about justice among students.
To fulfil the requirements of this component, you may attend both internal UTS and external lectures on justice and join discussion groups to reflect on the idea of justice. Lectures and discussion groups are assigned points; most lectures are worth five points each unless otherwise stated; and documented; participation in five discussion group meetings is worth 20 points.
Here you may undertake voluntary roles with a service and leadership element. Volunteering may be done in either legal or non-legal contexts.
Examples of how Brennan students are making a difference through their volunteer work include:
If you're a member of the legal profession who would like to explore the possibility of engaging with the UTS Law Brennan Justice and Leadership Program, either by presenting a justice topic to our students as part of our Justice Talks series, or providing volunteer opportunities for students, our team is ready to chat. See our UTS Law Brennan Brochure for a snapshot overview."

Mooting is an exciting way to gain high level courtroom skills and research experience, and is fully funded by the Faculty (including airfares, accommodation and competition expenses).
Mooting is a mock-court experience where students argue questions of law. Coveted by top law students and future employers scoping talent, mooting augments your ability to persuasively argue a case in court and become intimately familiar with relevant law through research.
UTS Law offers an award-winning mooting program. As a new law student, you will be encouraged to sharpen your mooting technique through junior level competitions run by the UTS Law Students’ Society. As your talents develop, you will have the opportunity to apply for a range of competitive-entry, merit-based national and international inter-varsity moots coached by experienced UTS Law academics. This includes the much sought-after Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot and the Oxford Intellectual Property Mooting Competition held at the University of Oxford.
UTS Law celebrates the achievements of our mooting teams at our annual Awards Ceremony. Mooting may also be counted as a credit toward your degree.
Congratulations to the Faculty of Law's mooting team who won the 2022 Oxford Intellectual Property Mooting Competition at the University of Oxford. The team included Madeleine Sherbon, Sam Guzman and Andre Murrell (a mix of Bachelor of Law and Juris Doctor students), coached by Evana Wright and Isabella Alexander.
The moot took place from 17 – 19 March 2022 at Oxford University and involved 30 teams competing from around the world. The Grand Final was judged by Lord Kitchin of the UK Supreme Court and Lord Justices Arnold and Birss of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales.
In addition to winning the Grand Final, Madeleine Sherbon won 4th best speaker in the preliminary rounds and Andre Murrell equal 5th best speaker from the preliminary rounds. The team also won second prize for written submissions.

Their ongoing feedback reveals that they are looking for students who have relevant work experience and relevant skills that demonstrate they can adapt to a workplace to deliver on projects. 
At UTS, you'll complete two 6-month internships as part of the Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice. The first one as early as second year and the second in fourth year. You'll also have the option of interning overseas thanks to our membership with the International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience (IEASTE). Paid professional traineeships are available in over 80 countries.
All students enrolled in the Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice take part in a 48-week structured Practice Program, consisting of two 6-month internships during their engineering course.
The diploma is a compulsory component for all domestic students enrolled in a single professional engineering course.
The internship enables students to link learning in the workplace to learning at university. It also ensures that graduates are in high demand with employers. Internships also provide employers with an opportunity to trial and recruit prospective graduate employees.
Developing complex engineering expertise can take a long time, typically 3-4 years post-graduation. The longer your internship, the greater exposure you'll have to the realities of the engineering world and the measures taken to tackle complex projects.
You'll complete two internships, one as early as second year and the other in fourth year, a total of 12 months, which will give you a distinct advantage at a job interview [if you haven't already stitched up employment in your second internship].
You're not on your own when looking for internships.
Dedicated staff are available to assist you with resume writing, interview skills and job finding strategies at UTS Careers. We maintain links with more than 1000 organisations offering both scholarships and internships, the latter being advertised on our in-house jobs portal, CareerHub. We also offer opportunities to find mentors, meet contacts, and build networks that will prove invaluable in your career.
An internship is similar to a full-time job.
You’ll be expected to commit to the contracted hours of employment during this time. Don’t worry, there are no other classes during this time so you can solely focus on your work placement.
Most students do get paid during their internship, however, this is at the discretion of the employer. In 2018, the average weekly salary for UTS Engineering students on their first placement was approximately $680, and $796 while on their second placement.
Yes. As part of the Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice, you must complete an internship.

There are many ways to get experience in industry outside of your internship. It's all part of your uni experience - you choose what you'd like to be involved in!
I chose UTS because they had a really good internship program, and I wanted to get that practical experience. All engineers do have to do a 60-day placement, but with UTS, it’s embedded in two six-month blocks. I knew that would be valuable.
Md Intisarul Hoque, Electrical Engineering
The internship program at UTS was a deciding factor. You come out of your degree with a year of work experience – I think that’s really important when your employers are looking for people and they know you’ve worked in the industry already.

Text: Jessica La Rosa, Bachelor of Information TechnologyJessica: I chose to go on exchange because I wanted to experience a new culture and I wanted to make new friends from not just Italy but all different countries.The thing I like the most about Italy is that it has such an interesting culture. The Italians really love family and they’re very close, very friendly. That’s great also when you’re studying there because it was really easy to make friends.
Text: Kruti Joshi, Bachelor of Arts in Communication (Journalism)Kruti: The thing I liked the most on exchange, from being from India and then living here for twelve years, I’ve never seen snow so I thoroughly enjoyed that and I also quite liked the people I met, most of them were from Europe and it was amazing to think like its such a small place and it could have so many different cultures and languages.
Text: Chun Lam Ma ( James), Bachelor of Forensic Science in Applied ChemistryJames: The main reason I chose to go on exchange was that I really wanted to experience something that was very different from my home country, Singapore and Sydney and I’d like to experience something that is more diverse in terms of education base.
Text: Luke Fergus, Master of ArchitectureLuke: the opportunity to study architecture in Denmark is quite appealing and also the chance to study in another school especially in Europe. To see their sort of teaching style and how they go about things was also attractive.
Text: Bradley Sacks, Bachelor of BusinessBradley: I think the specific skill that I developed while I was on exchange was how to manage money and I also learnt how to live by myself. I have never lived away from home before. As a matter of fact I have never actually travelled overseas before without my parents. I also learned how to be more confident and interact with different people from different cultures.
Jessica: What I loved about the university was that the teachers were very, very helpful. The subjects were exactly what I wanted. I wanted to study Italian as the language and it was so great to learn from Italians themselves.
Kruti: the best thing I gained while I was on exchange was a lot of friends and a lot of new acquaintances. If I ever go back to Europe I know I’ll have a place to go to and a person I can rely on.
James: When you go on exchange you get a global perspective. You get more culture embedded in you and what I think is that this experience is one of a kind you can’t get it else where. So I really recommend students, international students to go on exchange. Just go for it.
Jessica: It can be a bit scary at first to make the decision to move to a country at first. I think its very valuable and it could be the best six months of your life. Once you’re there, you’ll learn so much and you’ll make friends of a life time. So I really encourage you to go on it.

As a Pharmacy student, you can expect to combine the study of therapeutics and pharmaceutical sciences with the theory and practice of designing, developing, implementing and evaluating professional pharmacy services. Students have the option to choose electives that reflect their professional interests and will prepare them for the career they want.
Please note that Master of Pharmacy (International) includes International Placement 1 and International Placement 2 in addition to the above subjects.
UTS is known for its innovation. And this is evident in our partnership with Westmead Hospital., where instead of taking the hospital to the university, we've brought the students to the hospital.
So UTS is really known for its innovation. It's really cutting edge in terms of its resources and one of the areas that we've been demonstrating that is with our partnership with Westmead Hospital. So instead of taking the hospital to the university, we've brought the students to the hospital.
Westmead Hospital is one of the largest teaching hospitals in Australia, servicing over a million people in Western Sydney. Our partnership with UTS provides a unique opportunity for pharmacy students to experience the breadth and depth of hospital pharmacy practise that is otherwise not able to be undertaken as part of a traditional hospital pharmacy placement.
The Advanced Clinical Pharmacy elective's really interesting. So there's no lectures, there's no workshops, there's no formal classes. So what they're gaining is the opportunity to consolidate and to continue their learning but in a self-directed way. So they're learning to react as a pharmacist in that real-world setting.
From an employer perspective, it has been refreshing to watch the students grow and develop during their time with us, in particular, their clinical judgement and confidence in hospital pharmacy practise.
Being in the hospital setting and part of the pharmacy team, students develop their patient-centred care skills, they develop their critical thinking and their clinical judgement skills, and they really learn how to be a pharmacist.
So what I'm enjoying about the Advanced Clinical Pharmacy elective is that you get to take that theoretical knowledge that you learn every day at UTS in the classroom and apply it to a practical setting here at Westmead Hospital.
- I think this elective has really helped me understand the patient perspective, so it's really prepared me as a future pharmacist.
This elective's already helped me in my career. I've got an internship for next year in hospital pharmacy. It's also given me an opportunity to talk to different pharmacists who are in different roles and different stages of their careers and just see where it's possible to go with a career in pharmacy.
Master of Pharmacy students experience a diverse range of clinical placement opportunities. Students complete approximately 520 hours over the two year program, ranging from half day per week placements during teaching sessions to block placements during session breaks.
Enquire now
All placements are generally sourced for students by UTS Pharmacy. Occasionally students may choose to source their own clinical placement (around a particular area of interest or location, for example), but most prefer to take advantage of provided placements as these sites are carefully selected to complement in-class learning.
Students are allocated placements within the Sydney metropolitan and greater Sydney areas. Opportunities to undertake placements in rural and regional settings are also available for students.
Our partner pharmacies are located across the Sydney metropolitan and greater Sydney areas, from Hornsby in the North to Wollongong in the South; from Manly in the East to Penrith in the West.
Hospital pharmacy
Our hospital pharmacy partners include some of Sydney's largest teaching hospitals as well as settings in rural and regional Australia.
Students also have the option to pursue career interests outside the traditional areas of hospital and community pharmacy. Specialist settings can include:
Pharmacy Consultancy (e.g.Meditrax )
Pharmaceutical Industry
Government
Professional Organisations (e.g. National Prescribing Service)
Specialist Clinics (e.g. respiratory, oncology, drug and alcohol)
Research
Female 1: For two days I got to go to Nimbin. They have a multi-facility there where they have aged care and they have a few emergency departments, something that I've never seen before.  It was a really great experience. Everyone is just so willing to help and so much more enthusiastic
Male 1: What I like best about the program is being able to learn with other healthcare professionals and work on a case together and solve the patient's problem - all as a team.  They've got a holistic and multi-disciplinary approach to the whole thing.  They had a conference at the end and it really benefitted the patient to get all that collaborative effort to manage their pain properly. I thought that was really good.
Female 2: Being here with a Parkinson's patient and some of the changes we made in his medications, they followed him back to the hospital and he was just doing so much better the next time we saw him.  He was really grateful and it was an awesome experience.
Female 3: Here at the University Centre for Rural Health we have a six to eight week program for pharmacy students.  As part of that program they undertake placements in community pharmacies, hospital pharmacy and we organise a number of multi-disciplinary activities for them.
Male 2: Within the constraints that we've got here at the Lismore Base Hospital - as broader an introduction to hospital pharmacy as we possibly can.  Within the program, every day there's some learning objectives, so that I will try and sit down with the student at the end of the day and we will go through the previous day's learning objectives. Then at the end of their placement, we like to give the students a bit of a challenge and I try to organise for them to do a case study.  Then they'll present the work that they've done on that case study to the pharmacists at one of our weekly clinical pharmacist meetings.  So it's a good learning exercise for the students and it's a good learning exercise for us as well.
Female 2: Today we came out to a little school in Woodenbong and we gave a little presentation on healthy eating.
Female 4: After we finished our presentation we took them out and played a little game with them, which they had lots of fun doing.  Then we had a healthy lunch and a little handball that we could give them afterwards.  It was so good for us to tell all the kids about how important it is to eat healthy because hospitals and specialists are so hard to come by out here.
Female 2: It was really fun for us to be able to tell them a bit about us and what we do and tell them that they can go and see their pharmacist and I think a lot of the kids found that pretty interesting.
Female 3: The students find that rural living is fun. They find that the rural practitioners are welcoming, friendly, helpful and that they are prepared to spend a lot of time with them.
Male 3: Pharmacy students while they're here will see a number of things. Particularly what we're interested in exposing them to is dosing in the public sector. So a chance to give them a real good heads up for a day on addiction medicine I think is both beneficial for them and beneficial for us in the future.
Female 5: What we do here in Nimbin is a little bit unique and different. We approach it with a very holistic type of view.  It allows the pharmacy student to see that in a different light. So instead of just seeing it strictly as this diagnosed case, they see it as this human being and he's working with respect and trust to improve and have positive outcomes. That occurs all the time here in the NIS program.
Male 4: We are a community pharmacy and Aboriginal people are an important of our community.
Female 3: The patients are very willing to contribute to the students' learning, as are the clinicians. So the students get a wonderful learning opportunity. They get to do hands on work.  They're not just observers. They get totally engrossed and involved. They're allowed to go on home medicine review. They're allowed to interview patients at the hospital. They participate in our inter-professional learning workshop where they actually work with students who are from medicine, from nursing and from other Allied Health professions. Many students come to the Northern Rivers never having been to a rural area before.
Male 5: Coming from the city and coming here, it's a different change.  Just because there's a lack of resources and you're applying more of your knowledge. I feel that they appreciate it much more.e
Female 6: So it's really good that we're able to bring our knowledge to the table.  But then also we have students from other disciplines bringing their knowledge and we're able to learn off each other. So we're giving the patient the best care possible. I found that really beneficial, not only to my learning but also to patient care.
Male: 6: I guess we've only been touching on the surface because we've been here only a few days. But in that time so far I've met really great people, especially the students that we have to stay with. On top of that from the little hospital experience that I've had, it's that rural hospitality that's really good out here. I'm really looking forward to the rest of the time here.

Modern computer labs with 24/7 access, advanced computing facilities with the latest mathematical and statistical software are also available to assist with student work and learning.
Each coloured section within Hive Superlab is a distinct zone, allowing multiple classes to run in tandem
The underground Hive Superlab takes its name from hexagonal features designed to create an interactive ‘buzz’. Again, collaboration is the focus of this world-class teaching lab, which holds up to 270 students. Each coloured space is a distinct zone with specialist AV, including bone-conduction headphones that let lab-users hear their facilitator but also carry on conversations with peers. Up to seven classes can run simultaneously, allowing students from different disciplines to learn side by side. This creates opportunities for cross-discipline collaboration and cross-pollination of knowledge and ideas.
The Hive is a step up from our existing Building 7 Superlab, both in size and in the types of experiments it can accommodate. Designed to a PC2-standard, it will allow our students to get hands-on – or gloves-on – experience with a broad range of biological materials that could include food poisoning organisms like pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella, and organisms that can cause serious infections like golden staph.

The UTS: Science Super Lab is the first of its kind in Australia. Featuring modern equipment and technology it can accommodate up to 220 students from 12 different classes, with experiments from different disciplines running at once. This short video provides a detailed look into a day in the life of the Super Lab.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/curriculum-design/internationalisation,"Professional practice situated in a global workplace, with international mobility and international and cultural engagement as centrepiece
UTS graduates are living in a culturally diverse and increasingly internationalised world. Many will be working with groups in which cross-cultural communication and cultural safety will be important, working in different countries during their careers or working for organisations in which international travel and global interaction are the norm. Graduates’ international and intercultural capabilities will be critical for their lives as professionals and citizens.
International and cultural engagement imply the need for students and staff to develop the perspectives necessary to adapt their ways of working to different cultures and contexts (Leask, 2007). UTS has a strong and innovative International Studies program, students from more than 130 different language backgrounds, a culturally diverse staff, subjects that focus on international perspectives in some disciplines, the UTS BUiLD program and a range of other cultural engagement opportunities for students inside and outside the curriculum. The following indicates a broad range of ways in which UTS can extend students’ international and intercultural engagement:
Some of these opportunities, such as international experience, afford immersive experiences of other cultures that can transform the worldviews and personal capabilities of the students who participate. Others focus more strongly on ‘internationalisation at home’ (Nilsson, 1999), implying the broadening of international content and learning opportunities within the curriculum to enable students who do not go overseas to experience international and intercultural perspectives and engagement. Our culturally diverse student and staff population and Sydney location provide many opportunities for UTS to engage in these approaches.
It is also recognised that some disciplines vary more than others across cultures and different disciplines will have different approaches to some aspects of international and intercultural engagement. Comparing international case studies (for example) is likely to be more meaningful in Management than in Mathematics. However, all students need to develop capabilities for working in culturally diverse environments and some aspects of international and intercultural engagement can be developed in all disciplines. One example is the provision of opportunities for students to work in and reflect on their experiences in cross-cultural teams. Carefully designed teamwork activities in which diverse teams are an advantage can support students' development of cross-cultural capabilities.

Midwifery is focused on the care of women during pregnancy, labour and up to six weeks post-partum, and on providing health counselling and education within the wider community.
Midwives work in partnership with women and their families to provide support, care and advice throughout these milestone life events. They’re champions of normal birth, but can request or deliver medical, emergency or other care in the case of complications.
As experts in pregnancy, labour and post-partum care, midwives work with women and families at what is often a pivotal moment in their lives. At UTS, our specialist midwifery degrees are producing skilled and responsive graduates with the capacity to deliver informed, reflective and compassionate midwifery care. You’ll learn to consider midwifery as a health care discipline that encompasses not only the principles of primary health care but the emotional and social aspects of birth as well. Trained midwives are always in demand and a midwifery career can take you almost anywhere – a dramatic global shortage of midwives means qualified midwifery professionals are highly sought after in countries around the world.
Work as a midwife in hospital, community, public and private settings in metropolitan and rural areas, or pursue international opportunities in countries across the globe. Ready to move up in the world? Career progression opportunities include midwifery education management and research, and consultancy roles such as lactation or midwifery consultant or midwifery unit manager.
At UTS Health, we’re great at teaching – but we’re also known for producing qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods midwifery research in areas like vaginal birth after caesarean section, birth unit design, simulation and breastfeeding. We received the highest possible score (ERA 5) for midwifery research in the Australian Government’s latest Excellence in Research for Australia benchmarking initiative, and we’ve been highly successful in receiving competitive funding, including Australian Research Council and National Health and Medical Research Council grants.
UTS research in Midwifery, Child and Family Health aims to improve the health of Australian families through health research, education, practice development and consultancy.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health/whats-it-really/clinical-simulation,"Simulation-based learning experiences provide opportunities for students to participate in authentic and meaningful clinical scenarios that would normally only be encountered in the real clinical settings. Simulation-based learning provides opportunities for repeated practice of technical and non-technical skills with students’ learning enhanced by the provision of meaningful feedback and opportunities for reflection on practice.
Our award-winning simulation facilities and clinical skills laboratories have been purpose-built and designed to create engaging and exciting learning opportunities.  We have midwifery, acute care, community-based, paediatric, perioperative and critical care simulation facilities.
Visit our simulation facilities at an information event.
Simulation-based learning experiences are integrated into each session of the Bachelor of Nursing and the Bachelor of Midwifery courses, allowing students to become familiar with clinical environments from the beginning of their degree. Not only do students learn technical skills, simulation also provides opportunities for students to develop non-technical skills such as clinical reasoning, therapeutic communication, teamwork and empathy, which are critical for safe and effective care.
At UTS, our simulation-based learning experiences include part task trainers, high-fidelity manikins that bleed, cry and respond to pain, as well as actors, puppets, e-simulations and many other modalities.  Simulation sessions can be recorded and revised by students so that their strengths and areas in need of improvement can be identified.
Our simulations are evidence-based and of the highest standard. Many of our academic staff have been the recipients of grants and awards and have published widely about their simulation research. The insights and wisdom gained from this research helps to make our simulation-based learning program second to none.
Clinical simulations cover a range of scenarios informed by authentic contemporary practice. These include: aged care, antenatal care, asthma, birthing – normal and complex, chest pain, child and newborn care, deteriorating patients, emergency events, medical-surgical, mental health, perioperative and recovery room, palliative care / end of life, trauma and critical care.
This is a video montage of the different clinical scenarios that UTS: Health labs and staff are equipped to perform. The order of situations presented in our labs is: aged care, asthma, birthing (normal birth), deteriorating patients, emergency events, perioperative practices, chemotheraphy and palliative care, trauma and critical care.
 
Paper patient cases come to life for Science students in the Health clinical labs. First year students gain insight into the hospital and patient context for their human physiology subject which includes engaging with and understanding the ‘patient’ perspective. Second year students extend their appreciation of clinical settings within two cases and get some insight into hospital spaces, sounds and smells.

Sport and exercise is a professional field dedicated to the teaching, training or business of sport and exercise.
Sport and exercise professionals apply their expertise to jobs in sport, science, health, fitness and recreation. They can work in a sport science context, which is focused on the health, performance and wellbeing of the human body; or in a sport management context, which examines sport as a business opportunity.
Sport and Exercise students learning correct strength and conditioning techniques
All our courses are led by dynamic and highly qualified teaching staff, and they’ve all had extensive professional experience in sport and exercise education, policy or research roles.
Their diverse expertise means you’ll be exposed to a wide range of techniques and perspectives, giving you the chance to think about sport and exercise in a range of professional contexts.
All our course content is underpinned by the latest in sport and exercise research – and a lot of that research comes straight from UTS.
That means your learning will respond to the changing nature of the sport and exercise landscape, and it’ll also be embedded with the sort of evidence-based outcomes that are shaping the sector today. 
Beyond the UTS Campus, we’re a proud partner in the Moore Park precinct, a leading sports hub that’s home to the Qantas Wallabies, Wallaroos and the Australian Men’s and Women’s Sevens.
As well as providing high-profile cricket, rugby league, rugby union, Australian rules and football facilities, the precinct also contains academic facilities that are available to UTS sport and exercise science and management students. Here, you can study alongside elite athletes, work side-by-side with leading sports science researchers, and gain access to a wealth of athlete data – there’s no better way to put your learning in context.
Welcome to UTS at the Rugby Australia Building in Moore Park. This world-class facility is a first for Australia - embedding university programs in a sporting centre of excellence. It's home to more than 700 staff, researchers and students working across sport and exercise science and physiotherapy.
Our location within Sydney's elite sporting precinct provides us the opportunity to work as professional athletes, coaches and sporting organisations which is opening doors to internships and exciting careers.
Our high performance training spaces include a multi-purpose Sports Hall, a resistance training facility and this rooftop running track. State-of-the-art classrooms and study spaces make it a great place to learn, collaborate and connect. 
In our cutting-edge research labs we're working on a range of projects involving exercise physiology biomechanics, training sciences, skill acquisition, strength and conditioning and injury management and prevention. Our researchers are making an impact in both sports performance and health outcomes for people of all ages and abilities.

Some people invest in further study because it is required for career progression. Others have reached their preferred level but similarly want to increase their depth of knowledge and experience so they can take on work that is more challenging, stimulating and ultimately, rewarding.
Either way, we're here to help you do just that.
Our world-leading status is reflected in our rankings, most notably in our nursing and midwifery disciplines, ranked 1st in Australia and 11th in the world* and sport and exercise science, ranked 29th in the world*.
We have active partnerships with global health leaders like the World Health Organization, John Hopkins University and King's College, London.
Agile and innovative, our postgraduate courses respond to the ever-evolving health landscape. We leverage our industry partnerships to remain agile; in the past eight years, NSW business leaders and government have recognised UTS as Sydney’s most industry-focused university^. Combined with experts in the classroom, you’ll become a change agent, and future leader in health.
Be taught by internationally recognised health experts and researchers, who improve practice and inform policy in the real world and then inject that back into our curriculum.
We know that postgraduate students have busy lives, which is why we're doing everything we can to make your studies flexible.
Some of our postgraduate courses are offered completely online, while others are a blend of online and face-to-face learning. Either way you'll be supported by our academic leaders and student services, who really want to see you succeed. And when you are on campus, you’ll be studying in the heart of Sydney.
In a Master's program with nested options, you'll have the choice of a range of entry and exit options - you can complete subjects in the required order and exit after four subjects with a Graduate Certificate in your chosen specialty, or exit after eight subjects with a Graduate Diploma. Conversely, you can upgrade your Graduate Certificate to a Graduate Diploma or Master's by completing additional subjects (not available in all programs). This can be a quick progression, rolling up from one to another, or after a period of absence, so you can start and finish to suit yourself. 
We offer a wide range of postgraduate courses in health and healthcare, and many are interdisciplinary so you can tailor to your interests and career aspirations:

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health/why-health-uts/practical-experience,"At UTS, we’re focused on delivering clinical experiences that have a clear link to the theoretical components of your nursing or midwifery degree. We’re known for our commitment to hands-on practice, so both our course content and clinical experiences have been designed to help you build the skills you need to get ahead. What’s more, our clinical placements start early – depending on your course, you could find yourself on placement from your first semester of study.
You’ll complete some or all of the following clinical placements, depending on the nursing or midwifery course you choose. Note that the length of each placement will vary according to your degree and year of study.
Explore undergraduate clinical placement requirements. Explore postgraduate clinical placement requirements. 
No matter where you study nursing or midwifery, clinical placements will be part and parcel of your course. But at UTS, there are some key differences that set our degrees apart:
All our clinical placements are mapped to specific components of your nursing and midwifery course. For example, when you study Medical Surgical Nursing or Care of the Newborn in the classroom, you’ll follow it up with a clinical placement on the same topic. This approach gives you the chance to align your theoretical learning with your hands-on practice – and to put your learning to work in a real-world clinical space.
We’ve built extensive relationships with public and private health care providers in Sydney and beyond. In fact, we’ve signed student placement agreements with all the local health districts in New South Wales, which means you’ll have the chance to experience a real diversity of clinical environments as part of your placement experience. You’ll work in public and private hospitals and clinics, not-for-profit organisations and aged care services, to name a few. 
Our nursing degrees are generalist qualifications, but our Introduction to Specialty Practice placement will help you build specialist skills and experience in a niche area of health. Choose from Aboriginal health, aged care, community health, critical care, child and  family health care, global health (subject to availability), mental health, paediatrics, palliative care, perioperative care, reproductive maternal and child health care (subject to availability), substance use disorders (subject to availability) or women’s health, depending on your interests.   
When it comes to assigning you to a clinical placement, we take a data-driven approach that responds to your educational and personal circumstances. Our placement team will input your academic requirements (the subject you need to complete), your geographical location (where you live) and a list of suitable clinical placement providers. The upshot? Where possible, we’ll pair you with a clinical placement that’s within 90 minutes of your home address. 
Clinical placements will be a key part of your UTS experience. These placements will prepare you for professional registration as a nurse or midwife – and will also help you build critical hands-on skills that will shape your future career.
If you’re undertaking a combined Bachelor of Nursing and Bachelor of Arts in International Studies, the timing of your clinical placements will need to be approved by your course coordinator.
Undertaking an accelerated program (Enrolled Nurse entry)? Consult the UTS Handbook and relevant subject outlines for information on clinical placements.
For study days and clinical placements, see the Nursing clinical ladder in the UTS Handbook.
On-call work may be required throughout your course. During third year, you’ll spend the majority of your time in a clinical environment where you’ll be required to work shifts. By the end of the course, you will have followed a minimum of 10 women through their pregnancy and birth.
For study days and clinical placement, see the Midwifery clinical ladder in the UTS Handbook.
As a postgraduate nursing or midwifery student, you’re likely to have extensive experience in a range of clinical environments – but at UTS, you’ll gain even more. Our postgraduate degrees are all about building specialist skills in a particular area of clinical practice, and our placements are no different: you’ll learn to translate the theoretical knowledge you gain in the classroom into hands-on experience in the clinic.
During this one-year, full-time course, you’ll complete 32 hours of clinical practice every week for two sessions, plus a day of on-campus study every week.  Prior to commencing this course, you need to have secured your midwifery student position through the NSW Health Midwifery Student Applications for Recruitment and Training (MidStART) program. For more information on the program and application process, see the MidStART website.
Before you start your diploma, you’ll complete Preparation for Midwifery Practice, a two-week subject designed to get you ready for your placement.
This part-time degree spans two sessions of study. During Spring Session, you’ll complete 40 consecutive hours (a one-week block) in an observational placement.

They can be adapted for use in speech pathology, pathophysiology, pharmacy, genetic counselling and physiotherapy – which means that the possibilities for your professional growth are endless.
Read more about clinical simulation at UTS. 
Welcome to UTS's state of the art clinical laboratories. Class begins with our nursing students being invited into the lab by a member of the clinical teaching staff. Let's follow along.
Our laboratories are designed to mimic real world clinical practise so students can build the confidence necessary to treat future patients expertly. Students practise their skills on a selection of mannequins, part task trainers and at time they even get involved in role play scenarios, sometimes playing the patient themselves.
Most clinical laboratory spaces at UTS have a control room attached where academic and technical staff control, monitor and assess a student's engagement with our high fidelity mannequins. Students are examined on their skills in reaction to a number of scenario based assessments.
Our students have access to the supportive practise laboratory, a learning environment exclusive to UTS. Within this space, students practise any clinical skill of their choosing with a clinical facilitator under a guided practise approach.
UTS is Australia’s top ranked young university and ranked 1st in Australia for Nursing and Midwifery. We’re looking forward to welcoming you at our Health faculty!
Finbar: [00:00:03] Hi, welcome to the UTS Faculty of Health. Thank you so much for joining our nursing lab tour. On this level there are 16 clinical labs and eight simulation bays for our nursing and midwifery students.
Jenivy: [00:00:14] And here we're standing outside our clinical administration unit, who organise students' clinical placements in health care settings, like hospitals, aged care and community settings.
Finbar: [00:00:25] Let's head over the bridge to have a look at our facilities used for our nursing students.
Finbar: [00:00:29] Here is our first stop, a medical surgical nursing lab.
Jenivy: [00:00:40] Our labs are set up to look and feel exactly like hospitals, aged care facilities and primary health care services. The setup is flexible and there are generally two areas: the classroom area and the simulation area. In the simulation area of five to six bed spaces.
Finbar: [00:00:58] Between the labs is a preparation and equipment room. During class we access equipment we need for different nursing procedures.
Jenivy: [00:01:05] Back in the lab we have manikins to simulate patients.
Finbar: [00:01:09] Many of them are robotic and they have different levels of authenticity, or ability to mimic real-life patients. Some can simulate coughing, vomiting, perspiring, fitting and shivering. They can bleed or simulate a cardiac or respiratory arrest. They can speak, cry and groan so we can tell how they are feeling, just like a real-life patient.
Jenivy: [00:01:32] Simulated-based learning also involves role playing, where actors, people with lived experience, students and teachers all engage in clinical scenarios. These experiences help us to develop communication, empathy and teamwork skills, which are critical to good nursing.
Finbar: [00:01:50] Let's go meet one of our patients, SimMan.
Lily: [00:01:52] When you look around our patient's bed, you'll notice a lot of high-tech equipment. The large LCD screen can show data and scans such as blood results and X-rays. The monitor shows the patient's heart rate, oxygen saturations, temperature and blood pressure. Anything a student does to treat the manikin will be mirrored in their observations. So if they give blood pressure medicine, the manikin's blood pressure will change in response.
Lily: [00:02:16] On the ceiling are two microphones to capture what people are saying when they're working in this bed space. Three cameras reflect what's happening and can be viewed or saved in the control room for students to reflect on and learn from after the simulation.
Jenivy: [00:02:27] We've now entered the control room behind the one way mirror. It's the working hub for many simulated experiences.
Finbar: [00:02:36] The instructor PC shows the patient monitor screen. It controls the manikin and the responses triggered by students when they provide patient care. An instructor can direct the simulation from here as speaking as a patient through the manikin, or they can talk to the students via the speaker above the bed space.
Jenivy: [00:02:54] What happens in the control room is designed to ensure that simulations are realistic clinical scenarios so that students can learn in a really immersive way.
Finbar: [00:03:04] Now let's go have a look at one of our paediatric wards.
Michelle: [00:03:08] This space mimics a children's hospital setting. Nursing students learn about paediatrics throughout their degree, and they can also pick a paediatric elective in their third year. The manikins in here range from newborn to 12 years, but they have the same range of features as adult manikins. Paediatric processes can be complex, and one of the most important nursing skills is to administer medication correctly, because children's body weight is variable and much lower than adults', medication calculation is essential.
Lily: [00:03:41] Hi again. This is the perioperative nursing lab. You'll see that we have an operating theatre set up in here. In third year, nursing students can select perioperative nursing as an elective.
Jessica: [00:03:51] And this particular space is called the community room. It's flexible and can be used to simulate primary health care consultations, mental health nursing visits, care of an elderly person in their home and more.
Jenivy: [00:04:03] The last lab we'll visit today is this one, the practice lab.
Finbar: [00:04:08] This is where we can book in additional practice of our clinical skills.
Jenivy: [00:04:11] And build our confidence before clinical placements and assessments.
Finbar: [00:04:15] On our way out we'll take you past the student kitchenette.
Finbar: [00:04:18] In the kitchen, we have a fridge, freezer and microwave to be used by students at any time.
Jenivy: [00:04:25] And now we'll see our Health student computer and printing area. There's plenty of desks and bookable meeting rooms on this level, which makes it a popular place for group work and independent study.
Finbar: [00:04:40] Thanks so much for joining our tour. We hope you enjoyed gaining insight into being a nursing student at UTS.
Jenivy: [00:04:46] See you at UTS soon.
 
Josey: [00:00:04] Hi, welcome to UTS Faculty of Health. Come join us for our midwifery lab tour.
Jacqueline: [00:00:07] Let's head in and have a look at the clinical facilities available for UTS midwifery students.
Josey: [00:00:19] This is a midwifery learning space where most of our practical classes are. We can simulate environments where midwives practice, such as the home, hospital and emergency care settings. We do specific midwifery clinical skills and simulate normal and complex births. The simulation resources let us reproduce a range of midwifery scenarios during the pregnancy, labour and birth and postnatal care period.
Jacqueline: [00:00:41] The lab is an ideal place to practice as it accurately represents hospital and community settings so you can safely make mistakes here and learn from them. We have a few different pieces of equipment here, such as the birth bath, the stool, the rope, the beanbag and also manikins.
Jacqueline: [00:00:58] And the Resuscitaire. An open warmer that can be used after birth to help the baby if they need help breathing or to be resuscitated. It is also used for sick premature and full term babies to keep them warm when they need to be nursed in the intensive care.
Josey: [00:01:14] We have birthing simulators and manikins which can actually birth a baby. SimNewB can display symptoms of respiratory distress and realistic breathing. As a midwife we'll look after the mother and baby up to six weeks post-natal.
Jacqueline: [00:01:27] Connected to this lab is a scrub room with wash bay, storage and prep area.
Josey: [00:01:39] Let's take you to our clinical teaching and examination room. This room can be used for activities such as simulated community antenatal visits. It can be used as a women's health or diabetes clinic or another health setting.
Jacqueline: [00:02:00] Now we're in a space called the community room. This concept lab is a flexible space. The space can be set up for a variety of different midwifery scenarios. It can be used for situations such as home visits, home births, alternative births or antenatal and postnatal appointments.
Josey: [00:02:19] It's important to mention that not all our learning happens in labs. There's a lot of theory, anatomy and physiology and critical thinking. We also have tutorials in classrooms to learn non-technical skills such as communication, collaboration and teamwork, which are essential to midwifery practice.
Jacqueline: [00:02:34] Just across the way is our student computer area.
Jacqueline: [00:02:40] This is the computer area. Health students can access the computers and printers every day from 8.00am until 10pm.
Jacqueline: [00:02:49] There's also plenty of desks and a number of bookable meeting rooms across this level, making it a popular space for group work and quiet independent study.
Josey: [00:03:01] On our way out, we'll take you past the student kitchenette where we've got a fridge, freezer and a microwave for students to use at any time.
Josey: [00:03:14] Well thank you so much for joining our tour. We hope you've enjoyed this insight into being a midwifery student at UTS.
Jacqueline: [00:03:19] See you at UTS soon.
 
Our faculty is home to 16 clinical practice labs that have been set up to mimic real hospital environments. Briefing areas (where you’ll start and finish the class) open onto clinical spaces furnished with patient beds and a wide variety of medical equipment, including:
UTS nursing students practicing resuscitation in a clinical laboratory. 
Some of our labs have been developed to support highly specialised clinical scenarios, including our one-of-a-kind perioperative lab that comes complete with surgical tools and equipment and an anaesthetised manikin ‘patient’.
Five of the labs are high-fidelity simulation spaces – you’ll use these to engage with complex nursing and midwifery scenarios that will put your theoretical learning to work. Each lab has 3-5 dedicated bed spaces for team-based simulations and is equipped with ceiling-mounted cameras, microphones and speakers, enabling recording of clinical scenarios for peer and teacher review and feedback.
Simulation is a core component of all our laboratory teaching. In fact, we’ve received a Federal Government Teaching and Learning Citation for the hugely successful simulation in our Bachelor of Nursing and Bachelor of Midwifery programs. As part of our clinical labs curriculum, you’ll work on a wide range of simulated scenarios that use manikins and other medical technologies to replicate real-life practice.
Our labs are equipped with a range of manikins that can be programmed for use in specific clinical tasks – low-fi technologies can provide feedback on fundamental tasks like vital signs monitoring, while mid-range models can support the development of basic to intermediate clinical skills. 
High level robotic models such as SimMan®3G sit at the cutting edge of simulation technology – and we’ve got one in every lab. Used for complex clinical scenarios, these manikins mimic many of the functions of the human body.
They can:
A manikin used in the UTS laboratories.
Trying to master a particular clinical technique? Missed a class and need to make it up? Our practice labs are the place to go to brush up on a range of clinical skills as they relate to your course curriculum. There are separate labs for nursing and midwifery students, and they’re staffed year-round by a clinical education team whose sole purpose is to get you up to speed.
All our lab activities are supported by expert simulation technicians. These techs help maintain our equipment, troubleshoot tech challenges, and set up the simulations that you’ll complete in the labs. The presence of these sim techs (as we call them) means that help is always at hand – and it also frees up teaching staff so they focus on your learning.
As well as access to cutting-edge clinical environments, you’ll also benefit from a range of student spaces that have been designed to support your learning.
These include:
The Clinical Practice Laboratories are engineered to be flexible learning spaces.
Scrub rooms open onto clinical spaces furnished with patient beds and a wide variety of medical equipment. The labs are also fitted with classroom furniture and moveable walls that can be configured to suit the practical or theoretical task at hand.
Of the 16 labs, five state-of-the-art nursing and midwifery labs are equipped for higher fidelity simulation of a range of clinical scenarios. One dedicated bed space in each of these labs is fully configured to support team-based simulations using high fidelity equipment. Each space has 3 ceiling mounted cameras, microphones, speakers, a bedside patient monitor, and an LED screen.
The adjoining control rooms allow teaching staff and the Simulation Technician to remotely alter simulated patient states, observe students' responses and digitally record activities for facilitated feedback sessions. Video streaming to adjoining areas within and across campuses and to other external sites is also possible via internet protocol.
Supervisors in the control room supervise students in the lab.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/curriculum-design/our-graduate-attributes,"A graduate attributes approach to curriculum design focuses on the desired learning outcomes that students are expected to have achieved by the time that they graduate. As widely acknowledged in the literature, there is growing recognition in higher education of the need to not only identify the graduate attributes that a curriculum is supposed to develop, but also to demonstrate that these graduate attributes are actually addressed in practice. Drivers for these developments in Australia include professional accreditations, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA), which regulates and assures the quality of the higher education sector, the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), which is the national policy for regulated qualifications in Australian education and training and the increasing focus of business and employers on the 'employability' skills of graduates (Precision Consultancy, 2007).
Graduate Attribute (GA) frameworks have been established in many institutions to 1) ensure that an institution can demonstrate that their graduates have been exposed to, and assessed on, a range of graduate attributes including professional, personal and intellectual, and 2) to provide guidance to teachers and students along the way. Ideally, each assessment item, whether an essay, practical project or performance assessment will be linked through a set of performance criteria that contribute to the achievement of one or more graduate attributes. In this way, as a student progresses through the subjects in a course and undertakes the related assessments, his or her progress towards achieving the graduate attributes is being tracked and made visible to both the students and staff e.g. through the generation of a portfolio.
UTS courses are expected to enable students to develop three broad graduate attributes, as described in the UTS Graduate Profile Framework (PDF 135 kB).
A graduate of UTS:
Rather than describing a set of more specific generic attributes that must be developed in all courses, the UTS approach asks course designers to consider how students might develop intellectual and personal attributes in the context of professional (or disciplinary) knowledge and practices. Some of these attributes, such as communication and teamwork skills, would be considered desirable for graduates from all courses, but could be developed in different ways with profession-relevant focuses.
Embedding the UTS model in the curriculum and university life enables students to develop particular graduate attributes. The UTS Model of Learning provides a way of focusing on the development of particular attributes in the context of what, where and how the attributes are developed.
 
Attributes that may be emphasised by the different aspects of the model include:
Students may also experience aspects of the UTS model through their broader engagement in extra-curricular activities. Embedding of the UTS model in the university more broadly might be further achieved by enhancing the connections between course curricula and students’ engagement in university life.
An ATN project on the generic attributes of ATN graduates (Bowden et al, 2000) outlined a series of principles for curricula that develop graduate attributes. These principles include the need for students to experience a variety of opportunities to develop particular attributes in a variety of different contexts, and the need each assessment task to assess aspects of several different attributes explicitly. For example, a typical written assignment might be assessing aspects of students' subject understanding, their ability to identify and analyse information sources (information literacies, analytical skills) and their ability to write in a particular format (written communication eg in a report style).
However in most cases of university assessment, the link between graduate attributes and individual subjects and their assessments has been implicit at best with little attempt made at mapping how graduate attributes will be attained throughout a course of study. The actual implementation has been left to e.g. subject coordinators who have their own interpretation of what graduate attributes are and how they will be attained. Outcomes have not generally been tracked in terms of the achievement of relevant graduate attributes. We are not suggesting that a graduate-attributes focused perspective means that we should be narrowly specifying and assessing everything that students might be able to learn in their time at university, but we do suggest the need for a greater emphasis on whole-of-curriculum planning and implementation.
There are several web-based tools that support academics to systematically plan and document the relationships between course graduate attributes and subject objectives and assessment criteria and enable both academics and students to see how patterns of assessment contribute to the progressive development of graduate attributes. As UTS a number of faculties use 
ReView (prototype developed and trialled by Darrall Thompson, 2007 ). In addition to its uses in graduate attributes-based curriculum design, ReView enables academics to give criterion-referenced feedback to students on their assessment tasks and students to see how their assessment achievements in subjects contribute to their development of graduate attributes for the course.
E-portfolios, personal/professional development planning systems (PDPs) and progress files are becoming increasingly common as tools through which students can self-assess, document, provide evidence for and plan their development of attributes for purposes including future employment, personal growth, career planning and course and subject selection. The Higher Education Funding Council for England has been funding the development of PDP and related initiatives for a decade under quality and employability programs including Key Skills and Recording Achievement. Since 2005, all English universities have been required to provide opportunities for students to develop personal portfolios to record their learning achievements.
In addition, the development of particular graduate attributes, including employability skills, has implications for the provision of particular kinds of infrastructures and teaching and learning spaces. Teamwork and the capacity to assess one’s own performance and that of others are desired capabilities for graduates. A number of software tools (for example SPARK and TecTra have been designed to support the development of teamwork capabilities and students’ capacities to make judgements about their own performance and that of their peers. Tools like these and others that simplify broader processes of self and peer assessment should be considered. Functionality that would enable students to create their own online groups within the online learning environment might also be considered.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/curriculum-design/ideas-about-learning-and-their-implications,"While there is no single, universally accepted theory of learning, most learning theorists would agree that students are not empty vessels who passively absorb information. Learning is a relation between students' prior knowledge, values, expectations and their environments. Learning involves active learner engagement of one form or another and  is always the learning of something - whether the 'something' be disciplinary concepts, social practices or ways of being a particular kind of person.
There are a number of current learning theories that might be of relevance to practice-oriented curricula and this section provides some very brief outlines of some with their implications. It does not attempt to include all theories that might be relevant or deal with the theoretical similarities or distinctions between these theories.
Constructivist theories maintain that learning involves the active construction of knowledge and that the development of new knowledge is influenced by prior knowledge and expectations. These theories vary in the extent to which learning is seen as individual or social. Approaches that have been influenced by constructivist ideas include active learning, problem-based learning, experiential learning and inquiry-based approaches.
Situated learning theorists (for example Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998) maintain that learning is situated in socio-cultural contexts. Learning is essentially a social process. Learning takes place through participation in activities within communities of practice and reification of ideas within these communities. In a practice-oriented educational context, situated learning ideas have obvious implications for the inclusion of authentic experiences of practice and work integrated learning but they also emphasise the social dimensions of learning and the need for collaboration and interaction.
Variation theory (Marton & Booth, 1997; Marton & Tsui, 2003; Marton & Pang, 2006) maintain that learning requires the experience of variation. For example, to learn to understand a threshold concept, learners need to experience (among other forms of variation) the variation between their prior understandings and disciplinary understandings of that concept. Implications of variation theory include the need for learners to experience variation in contexts of learning and application (Bowden et al, 2002), for example in developing information literacies students would need to experience variation in information sources and the information to be found in them, ways of searching, different contexts for seeking and making use of information and so on. It is not sufficient for teachers to simply present the relevant variation as this does not guarantee that students will experience it. Learning activities may need to be designed in ways that assist students to see as relevant and notice the aspects of variation that are important amongst all of the other aspects of complex environments. For example, engaging students with practice applications then with theories relevant to those applications may be more effective than the more usual approach of presenting decontextualised theories followed by applications. While variation theory is not explicitly a social theory of learning, other students are seen as important sources of variation with students learning from the different ideas, perspectives and problem-solving approaches of others.
Curriculum design consistent with current ideas about learning 
Students need opportunities to generate and test out ideas, to experience variation between their previous ideas and new ones, to learn in authentic contexts of practice, to learn collaboratively with others, to reflect on their learning and to have appropriate choice and control over their learning. To be consistent with these ideas, any technologies need to be able to support student as well as staff generation and sharing of content, student inquiry, collaboration and student documentation of and reflection on learning.
This does not mean that there is no place for lectures. Good lectures can motivate students, present overviews of key ideas or highlight differences in perspectives or provide opportunities for students to learn from lecturers’ practice experiences and practice-focused research. However, lectures need to engage students and students need to be able to discern and focus on the meaning of the ideas or concepts being presented. This is often not the case, particularly when lectures present large amounts of material with no or few opportunities for active engagement and reflection. Current ideas about learning imply that lectures could be less dominant as a mode of teaching, and that the lectures that are offered could afford more opportunities for active learning, interaction, inquiry and reflection. Podcasts or other recordings from lectures might be most useful for learning if they are edited, helping students to focus on key concepts or ideas, or if they are used to present material, such as stories of practice, that students cannot easily access from other sources (such as textbooks). Flexibility is important for meeting the needs of students with increasingly complex lives, but should be balanced with the need to engage students in experiences that are more likely to lead to desirable learning outcomes."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/curriculum-design/improving-subject-design,"The way you design your subject depends on a lot of things, such as:
There are no recipes, however, if you want to improve students' learning, here are some starting points for good subject design:
Look at whether your learning objectives, assessment and teaching and learning activities are constructively aligned.
If you want to read more, an excellent article to begin with is: 'What the student does: Teaching for enhanced learning' (J. Biggs (1999), Higher Education Research and Development, 18 (1) 57-75). This focuses on using the ideas of constructive alignment to help all students to learn in the ways that the more-academically inclined do naturally.
Review what you already know about students and their learning in your subject. Ask yourself questions like:
Whether you've been teaching the subject for a long time or have just started, it's useful to collect some information directly from your students - not necessarily about what they like or dislike but about their learning and what helps them to learn? One way to do this is by asking them to write responses to some simple open-ended questions such as:
Once you have students' responses, you'll have a better idea of the things to keep - or enhance - and the things that could be changed. To decide what to do next you may need to consult other sources, like colleagues, the literature on learning and teaching, or learning and teaching staff from IML.
Students do subjects as part of their course.  Each subject should make a contribution to students' achievement of one or more of the course graduate attributes, through contributing to one or more course intended learning outcomes.   Subjects in the first year and those taken by pathways students in their first semester are likely to play a role in helping students to make the transition to university study, while subjects at the end of a course will be preparing students for future employment or research degrees and assuring that students have achieved the intended learning outcomes for the course.
The Subject Descriptions and Outlines Policy lists the minimum subject information that must be provided to students. This subject data is held in the Curriculum Information System (CIS).
UTS Subject Outline PDFs are created and updated for each teaching session via the Subject Outlines component of CIS. Faculty approval is required to change some parts of the Subject Outline, for example the learning objectives, how these objectives relate to the course intended learning outcomes and overall assessment.
Full information about registering for access to CIS and using Subject Outlines, including what data you can edit and making the final PDF available to students in Canvas is in the online documentation."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/enhancing/enhancing-experiences-group-work/introduction-group-work,"Student-based group work (also known as team work) has become an integral part of studying at UTS. This mode of teaching has primarily arisen in an attempt to capture many of the benefits associated with collaborative activities (namely peer learning and graduate attribute development).
While efforts have be made to embrace group-based learning at UTS, students' reaction to these efforts appear somewhat mixed. Recent data collected from a number of sources at UTS (eg. Planning & Quality Unit, Institute for Interactive Media and Learning, UTS BELL Program), suggests that students have strong opinions (both positive and negative) associated with group work.
From a positive perspective, students report enjoying the social aspect of group work (eg. making new friends and networking) and the benefits deriving from group synergy (eg. sharing workloads). Despite recognising these positive aspects, most students at UTS hold an overall negative attitude towards group work. This is particularly so for collaborative activities that are formally assessed. Students report that their dissatisfaction with group work stems mainly from:
This research also suggests that this overall negative attitude towards group work originates from a number of key problems faced by students whilst participating in group work. These are:
In recent years, many efforts have been made to enhance the functioning of student groups and to improve the overall attitude students hold toward group work. Whilst many of the initiatives have been highly successful, their dissemination to the broader academic community has been difficult. This is mainly due to the trend of reporting teaching and learning innovations at the disciplinary level. This means that many of the ""best practices"" developed and applied in one faculty may never be known by those in other faculties even though they may be applicable and capable of enhancing the subject's teaching and learning objectives.
In an attempt to address this concern (and the many problems associated with group work raised earlier), the Institute for Interactive Media and Learning (IML) has produced this Resource Kit devoted to the topic of student-based group work. This Kit has been derived from multiple disciplines and covers a range of ""best practice"" teaching and learning techniques devoted to improving group work for students.
This Kit is divided into seven units:
Unit 1: Designing Group Assignments
Unit 2: Preparing Students for Group Work
Unit 3: Forming Effective Groups
Unit 4: Getting Groups Started
Unit 5: Monitoring Groups
Unit 6: Assessing Groups
Unit 7: Helping Students Reflect on their Group Experience
Within these units you will find a range of techniques and tips which may be useful for your own group-based teaching. This Kit also contains a number of group exercises to run with students and a few ""must read"" articles which can be found in the appendices.
Presently, the content of this Resource Kit focuses on student groups in a face-to-face environment who are working together on a collaborative assessment task (eg. group assignment). However much of this content is also relevant to groups operating on-line, provided that there is some face-to-face group interaction (eg. in the formation stage, if groups have face-to-face meetings)."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/enhancing/enhancing-experiences-group-work/designing-group-assignments,"This unit includes suggestions for designing group assignments which students will finding motivating. It will cover issues such as making the assignment:
One of the most crucial aspects of group work is the task set for the group. If students engage in their task, they will be more likely to be motivated to be an active participant in group work and develop new skills. Unfortunately, many students find their tasks to be inappropriate or too difficult for group work and thus lack motivation to work collectively on the assignment. In fact, many students view their assignments as little more than an individual assessment task applied to a group of students to reduce marking.
To develop a motivating group assignment, first you need to understand what students look for in a collaborative assessment task. Understanding students' expectations is important because it allows you to see where your task can be aligned with their expectations. It also allows you to identify where alignment may not be possible. These differences can then be discussed with the students so they understand your reasons. Students will always work better when they understand why they are being assessed in a particular way.
There are four important factors which students look for in a group assignment: 1) if it's meaningful 2) if it is easily allocated into sub-tasks 3) what they will learn? and 4) is it achievable?
Students are not only motivated by the mark they will receive for their assignment. They are also motivated by the work they will produce.
Students often report that their most motivating group assignments are those which are ""client-based"". These are assignments where the groups enact the role of consultant and work on an issue which has been identified by the client (in most instances, an organisation). Groups usually produce some form of written report (or in some disciplines a product) which is assessed by the lecturer. Occasionally, the client is also invited to assess the group's output. Students are particularly motivated when they know that the client will be viewing and assessing the work.
Designing ""client-based"" group assignments are becoming increasingly popular in university settings. Many organisations are interested in participating in such projects because of the insights and perspectives generated by the project groups. Non-profit organisations, with their limited resources, are often keen to become clients and students are particularly motivated to help such organisations.
Some lecturers are even beginning to view the university as a client and are designing group assignments which address particular concerns faced by students and staff.
Student groups almost always divide up their task and allocate different sections to each member. Even if you do not want the assignment to be broken up, they probably will (or at least attempt to do so).
Students argue that this is the only strategy to use when they are members of 3 or 4 other groups. Unfortunately, most groups struggle when they attempt to divide up the task because it has not been designed to be broken up. It has been designed to be completed collectively. The rationale behind this strategy is that students learn group skills by closely working together on every aspect of the task.
While this strategy can be effective, it usually takes much longer than one semester for it to work. Furthermore, it usually requires that members work together full-time on the one task. With students working part-time, on more than one task, in more than one group, it is in many ways an unrealistic strategy. There is just not enough time for students to work together on every issue.
Knowing that students divide up their group task, many lecturers are beginning to devise group assignments with this in mind. In these assignments, each group member is required to do a piece of work. These individual pieces are then combined together to form a completed group product (there is usually an introduction and conclusion which the group write together to bring the individual sections together).
Lecturers also report that they are better able to assess group work. They are able to assess each member's individual piece and how the pieces fit together as a group product.
As with any innovation, there are of course critics to the approach. The main criticism is that students are not working in ""fully fledged"" groups and, as such, fail to develop a broad range of skills. While this may be true, proponents argue that it is far better to learn some skills well than many at only a shallow level. This approach works on the rationale that students should not be expected to learn too many skills in a semester, but rather focus on a number of key skills (eg. coordination, peer support, accountability). Proponents also argue that the notion of the fully fledged group rarely exists in industry and that their approach more accurately mirrors the ""real world"". In many organisations, team members often work independently on individual pieces and bring them together to form the product (or the collection of group products). The aim of their approach is to reflect this style of team work and to teach students how to operate under such a system.
It is understandable that many group assignments must be collaborative and result in a single product. For these assignments, it is important to remember that students will try to split the task up. If the task can be logically divided, it may be advisable to help them do so — this will save the group valuable time. If the task cannot be broken apart, this should be clearly explained to students before they try to do so.
As mentioned earlier, many students are sceptical about collaborative assessment tasks and often view them merely as a way of reducing marking. For students to be motivated to participate in group assignments, they often need to see the tangible benefits of doing so. This is best achieved by designing group assignments which are closely aligned to the learning objectives of the subject.
When designing collaborative assignments, it is important to consider what knowledge, skills and abilities you want your students to learn through group work. While there will be a generic set applicable to most group assignments (eg. learning to communicate and cooperate with peers), there will also be a specific set which need to be geared to the assignment. For example, what type of interpersonal communication skills do you want your students to learn? Do you want them to learn to communicate face-to-face or also to learn computer mediated communication? If the latter is important, then establishing an ""on-line"" group task (eg. an on-line debate or discussion group) would be appropriate. What type of group presentation/reporting skills do you want your students to learn? Do you want students to learn how to produce a written document as a group and/or to make a formal oral presentation? If you want your students to learn both, then oral group presentation would be appropriate component to the assignment.
All too often, lectures design group assignments with little reference to the learning objectives and this can create confusion for students. For example, students often fail to see how requirements such as communicating ""on-line"" or making a group presentation are relevant to their learning outcomes. Whilst the objective may be clear to the lecturer, students often have little idea. It is therefore important that the objectives of the group assignment are explicitly made known to students. This is best achieved through a well structured subject outline that breaks down the group assignment into its sub-components and links each component to a key learning objective. For example, in a subject outline, a student might read: ""In this assignment, you will be required to communicate with your fellow group members both face-to-face and on-line. This requirement is to help you learn how to communicate in multiple modes and understand how your participation in each mode may vary depending on your preferred communication style."" As can be seen in this example, students will understand what they will be required to do and most importantly, what they will learn through their participation.
When designing an appropriate group assignment, it is also important to set a task which can realistically be achieved by students within the specified time frame. Whilst the task may be meaningful and challenging, it can become too time consuming and overwhelming for students. This is particularly the case when students are doing equally challenging group assignments in their other subjects. Students often complain that many of their difficulties arise from the multiple group assignments they are forced to do each semester and how many lecturers are either insensitive or oblivious to this fact. The unfortunate result is that students become disillusioned with their group assignments and tend to apply themselves less. This usually results in a decrease in learning, motivation and output quality and an increase in group related problems such as conflict and the withdrawal of effort. To help design a realistically achievable task, it may therefore be worth ""standing back"" and viewing the group assignment from the student's perspective."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/enhancing/enhancing-experiences-group-work/preparing-students-group-work,"This unit includes suggestions for preparing students for group work. It will cover issues such as:
For students to operate effectively in groups, preparation is essential. Students should not be expected to be ""team ready"" just because they have been working in groups before. Each group experience is new and students need to cover the basics. For example, students need to know:
You can not assume that students know this information. Most students are very sceptical about group work and have little idea of the reasons they are made to work in groups. If students are informed about the basics, they are more likely to understand the rationale for group work in their subject. As a result, they will also be more likely to enter their groups with the attitudes, expectations and motivation necessary to engage at a high performance level. Informed and motivated students will also be much more willing to learn from their group experiences.
There are a number of steps involved in preparing students for group work. The first step is to provide students with a written rationale for group work. The second step is to reinforce the written rationale with a verbal presentation about group work. The third and final step is to encourage member familiarity before group formation.
In most instances, students first become aware of group work in the subject by reading the subject/course outline. Students will read the word ""group work"" long before they hear it in the class room. It is therefore important that the rationale for group work is contained in the subject outline.
As a general rule, the more information you can provide to your students about group work, the better. For many students, a comprehensive and well structured section on group work in the subject outline tends to reflect the lecturer's overall commitment to the principles of group work. When there is little reference to group work in the outline (and there is an assessable group work component), students often perceive that the lecturer is only using group work as a workload reduction strategy. In these instances, students feel ill-prepared for group work and have little confidence that the lecturer will oversee the groups effectively. Self-fulfilling prophecies such as these can be dangerous because they can destroy groups before they even begin. 
Despite slight variations, an outline with a comprehensive group work section contains all the information students need to prepare for group work. This section should include statements concerning:
 
Students should not only read the rationale for group work, but they should also hear it. Presenting the rationale is one of the most crucial aspects of student-based group work. It is when most students decide to ""buy in"" or not. The delivery of the rationale, however, must be genuine. Students will be looking just as much at your body language as they are listening to your voice. They will be looking for signs of your commitment to group-based learning. You can't expect your students to be committed to group work if you're not. 
In most instances, your verbal presentation about group work should take place in the first lecture or tutorial. It is best if it follows and reinforces the material you have written in the subject outline. Following the presentation, some lecturers hold a ""question and answer"" session/class discussion where students have an opportunity to voice their concerns about group work. This session is particularly useful because it allows you to cover any additional issues not covered in the subject outline. It will also help students see your commitment to group work. 
If time permits, it is often a good idea to help students in your class become familiar with each other. In most instances, the students in your class will not know each other very well (if at all). In a week or two, they will be expected to begin working together as a group. It is therefore important that students get to know others in their class as these people may be their fellow group members in a few weeks time. 
An effective way to encourage familiarity is to run an ""ice-breaking"" group exercise. This will not only encourage familiarity, but also help students practice team work. UTS library has a large collection of team-building books which contain ice-breaking exercises. References to some of these books can be found at the end of this unit. 
For the purposes of the exercise, it is best if you randomly assign students into groups. This will allow students to work with new people (which is the main aim of the exercise). It is important to note that these groups are only temporary (ie. only for the exercise) and are not applicable for the group assignment. Selection of members into these assignment groups will be covered in the next unit (Unit 3: Forming Effective Groups).
The emergence of high performing groups should not be the sole responsibility of the lecturer. Students also need to take responsibility for their own preparation and development. Students often work best when they identify and solve problems for themselves. This also applies to the learning of group related skills. As with most other areas of group work, students may need help in order to help themselves. The best way to do this is to lead them to the appropriate resources. 
UTS library has a large collection of team-building books which contain ice-breaking exercises. These include:
UTS also holds the serial called the Annual Handbook for Group Facilitators (UTS Call No.: City 158.2/20) which is an excellent source for ice-breaking exercises. 
The benefits of group work are covered in a number of excellent references held at UTS. These include:
Students often find it useful when they are provided with a few readings to help with their development of group work skills. Some of the more useful references in the UTS library are:"
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/enhancing/enhancing-experiences-group-work/forming-effective-groups,"This unit includes suggestions for forming student groups. It will cover issues such as:
For many students, being in the ""right"" group is extremely important. To most, the ""right"" group is determined by the people they will be working with. Most hope to be placed with compatible members (primarily people they get along with). All too often, this does not happen. The result is a very long and frustrating semester for everyone involved (the lecturer included). As the opening quotations highlight, students soon realise that a key determinant of group work will be their fellow members. 
Most students dread the time when groups are formed in class. For first year students, it is the fear of the unknown. Many do not have extensive collaborative experience and have just come from the highly competitive and individualistic environment of high school. They know few people in their class and even less about how to operate in groups. For second year students up to postgraduates, it's usually the fear of the worst. Most have either been in, or known someone who has been in a dysfunctional group (typified by shirking, conflict, etc.). Their fear is that it will happen to them, perhaps for the first time, perhaps again. 
Many of the problems (and fears) which arise from group work stem from the formation process. The formation process sets the foundations for effective group work in the future. If the foundations are weak, it will be difficult for students to develop into a cohesive and effective unit. If the process has been well planned and executed, the conditions have been set for high performance groups to develop. 
 
Group work varies greatly at UTS. It largely depends on the task that students are required to do. In some instances, the task is complex and thus requires a certain number of members. These tasks are usually found at the third year level and are often multidisciplinary (ie. involving students from a number of disciplines). On most other occasions, the group task has been designed to be performed by a small group of individuals (usually less than seven members per group). The assumption in these groups is that all members have about the same level of content specific knowledge (ie. knowledge of the subject matter) and the purpose of the group activity is for students to apply the knowledge learned throughout the semester whilst also learning how to work with other people. 
Despite having different tasks, most group activities subscribe to the same basic model — groups are formed, they perform a task(s) and then disband. Unfortunately, many believe that the forming stage is a simple process that ""has to be done"". This belief all too often sets weak foundations. For strong foundations to occur, two important issues should be considered. These are: 1) the size of the groups and 2) the allocation of members into groups. 
As discussed above, the size of each group depends on the group's task and the resources available for each group. However, as a general rule, groups of around four members tend to work well. 
Four-member groups work well for a number of reasons. These include:
However, four member groups do have a number of drawbacks. First, if a member leaves the group (eg. leaves the subject or transfers tutorials), this can create too much work for the three remaining members. It is therefore important not to establish the groups too early in the semester (eg. week one). It's best to wait a week or two until the class numbers settle. These weeks should be used to prepare students for group work (see Unit 2: Preparing Students for Group Work). Second, there will be more groups in the class (hence more management, marking, etc.). Although there will be more groups, the benefits of smaller sized groups far outweighs the costs.
There is no ""one right way"" to allocate students into groups. Rather, there are a number of practices you can use. Once again, these practices depend heavily on the task set for the group, the expertise of each student in the class and, most importantly, the learning objectives for the subject. 
Most selection methods fall into four categories. These are:
The first three methods are commonly used when groups are given the same group assignment (ie. a group essay or report on a pre-defined topic). The final assignment method is used when groups are able to choose from a number of pre-set topics. Rather than present a single method, all four of these methods will be discussed in order for you to weight up the options for each. A quick reference table outlining each method is included at the end of this unit. Random Appointment. Many lecturers use some form of random appointment method to form groups. One of the most popular is the call-off system. This is when the lecturer walks around the room and assigns each student in the class a number or letter in a systematic call off (ie. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5… etc. or A, B, C… A, B, C… etc.). Groups are then formed by putting all the 1's, 2's etc together. Other random appointment methods include students drawing numbers from a ""hat"" or the lecturer placing the students' names in the ""hat"" and then drawing them out. 
Random appointment methods are often employed because they are seen as having a number of advantages. These include:
The random appointment method does have some drawbacks, however. These include:
Self Selection. In many instances, students are asked to form into groups themselves. Under these conditions, students usually know people in their class and choose to work with them. For those who do not know others in the class, these students tend to form groups with those they are sitting near or with others who may not know anyone either. At the postgraduate level, students often select to work with people who work in a similar field (from the typical introduce yourself session). 
The main advantages of the self selection method are:
The main disadvantages of the self-selection method are:
Selective appointment. An increasing number of lecturers are beginning to see the benefits of the selective appointment method. This method attempts to form groups based on a criteria. This can be a shared criteria (eg. mark aspirations, an available meeting time) or a specific criteria (eg. a skill or style). 
The shared criteria method attempts to form homogeneous groups. It works on the assumption that groups work better when the members share something in common. One criteria lecturers are using is mark aspirations. Students are asked to think about what mark they aim to get for the subject. Students are then instructed to move to one of the four corners of the room (the HD, D, Credit and Pass corner). Groups are then formed from the students in each corner. Usually, there are only a few students in the HD, and D corners. Sometimes these two corners will have to merge to form one group. Often the Credit and Pass corners have a large number of students and need to be broken down further. This is achieved by separating the students into high credit and low credit and high pass and low pass. An alternative method is to break these corners on another criteria such as when students can meet up out of class (eg. before class or after class) or where they live (eg. North, South, East or West of UTS). 
There are many advantages associated with the mark aspiration appointment system. These include:
The mark aspiration system does have a few disadvantages. These include:
The specific criteria method attempts to form heterogeneous groups. It works on the assumption that groups work better when the members are balanced. There are many criteria used to form groups. Some of the more popular methods use functional roles or learning styles. These systems involve students completing a questionnaire which is scored to determine a student's preference. Students with different styles are then appointed to each group so as to achieve the desired balance. There are a number of advantages to the specific criteria method. These include:
While effective, these methods do have drawbacks. These include:
Task appointment. Another popular method to form groups is the task appointment method. Here, the lecturer offers the students a number of topics and lets them select. Groups are generated from the topics nominated. Nomination for the task may involve submitting a preference sheet (students are usually required to rank order the topics from most to least preferred) or the students writing their name on a topic sign-up sheet.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/enhancing/enhancing-experiences-group-work/getting-groups-started,"This unit includes suggestions for helping groups start off on the ""right foot"". It will cover a range of team-building exercises that will help your students:
After groups have been formed, students are usually expected to begin working together. For many lecturers, there is an assumption that students know how to work cooperatively from their very first meeting. Unfortunately, most students find their first few meetings difficult to run. Rather than let groups struggle, it is advisable that their first few meetings are structured. An effective way to do this is to use a number of team-building exercises. The main aims of these exercises are to:
By serving these aims, these exercises will help group members:
This unit will also discuss some techniques to help students organise and run their group meetings.
Most of the team-building exercises available to facilitate group work fall under three broad categories: 1) getting acquainted exercises, 2) norming exercises and 3) ice-breaking games. 
As the name suggests, these exercises help group members get to know each other. When students first meet, most do not like to ask too many questions. Furthermore, most students tend only to make ""small talk"" (eg. where do you work?). While this information is useful, students tend not to ask questions related to the group work ahead of them. For example, students rarely discuss issues such as the mark each hopes to achieve or their likes and dislikes of group work. All too often, students unfortunately find out this information the hard way. The point of these exercises is to encourage students to discuss these issues early, so as to avoid the simple misunderstandings which often result in conflict. 
While there are many ""getting acquainted"" exercises available, most have been designed for organisational work groups (ie. work teams). As such, many are not fully applicable to student-based groups who have limited class time available to run group exercises (ie. most tutorials are only 1 hour long). The Institute for Interactive Media and Learning (IML) at UTS has addressed this issue by designing an exercise specifically to help students get acquainted with their fellow group members. This exercise requires members to interview each other on set questions which allow students to discuss issues such as their strengths and weaknesses as a group participant and their likes and dislikes of group work. By the end of the exercise, students will have developed a much better understanding of their fellow group members. The information required to run this exercise (called ""Getting to know you"") can be downloaded. You should run this exercise in the group's first formal meeting (eg. straight after your groups have been formed). 
The main aim of these team-building exercises is to help group members develop a shared understanding of how their groups will operate. Groups always work more effectively when they have set some common goals and ground rules. Unfortunately, many students fail toexplicitly discuss this information and often ""pay the price"" some time later. It is therefore crucial that group members communicate their expectations to each other as early as possible. It is far easier to deal with mismatched expectations before, rather than after, they have come into play. 
Despite their importance, students rarely express their expectations to each other. Whilst most would like to, they often need a little encouragement to do so. This is where a norming exercise is most useful. In general, norming exercises are those where groups are required to discuss and document what they will be doing and how they will go about doing it. Examples of such exercises are those where groups make a mission or vision statement, an agreement or contract. Their purpose is not to make something ""legally binding"", but rather to produce a document that has emerged through discussion and agreement. It is the act of producing the document that is crucial in the norming exercise. The content of this document is an added bonus. 
Most team-building books contain at least one norming exercise. As most of these exercises have once again been designed for industry teams, they are often not fully applicable to student project groups. One exercise by Federman Stein and Hurd (2000), that has been specifically designed for student groups, is a little too long for student groups at UTS. Rather than devise an alternative, IML has adapted Federman Stein and Hurd's (2000) charter exercise so it can be run within a shorter time frame (ie approximately 30 minutes). In this exercise, groups are required to collectively answer questions dealing with ground rules (eg. where and when will meetings be conducted) and goals. Groups are then able to use this document as a point of reference to help keep them on track and to manage any minor disputes which may arise. The information required to run this exercise (called the ""Charter exercise"") can be downloaded. It is advisable to run this exercise in the group's second formal meeting. However, it can be run in the their first meeting (along with, but after the ""Getting to know you"" exercise) if time permits.
Another type of team-building exercise is the ice-breaking game. Primarily, their purpose is to encourage interaction between group members. This is usually achieved by making the group's task engaging and fun for participants. Whilst they aim to ""ice break"", they are also designed to help group members bond and gain experience working together. 
Unlike the getting acquainted and norming exercises discussed earlier, most ice-breaking games are generic and apply to both work teams and student groups. This means there are a large number of such games available to use. Quite often, it is the more ""hands on"" games which are the most popular with students (particularly undergraduates). These games usually require groups to build a structure together from items such as cardboard boxes, string and masking tape. 
In Federman Stein and Hurd's (2000) book, the authors suggest a number of ""hands on"" games which can be run with student groups. Their tower building activity (where groups are required to build the tallest tower from drinking straws and masking tape), is probably the easiest to run within the least amount of time. The instructions offered by Federman Stein and Hurd (2000), however, are a little unclear about the materials needed. Once again, IML has adapted this exercise to make it more ""user friendly"" for UTS staff. The information required to run this exercise (called the ""Tower building exercise"") can be downloaded. We recommend that you run this exercise in the first few weeks of the group's life. It is best run straight after one of the previously mentioned exercises (ie. the ""Getting to know you"" or the ""Charter exercise""). It can also be run as a ""stand alone"" exercise if needed. If so, it should be run after groups have participated in the other two exercises.
For groups to be effective, they must have regular and productive meetings. Group members need to know what their fellow members are thinking and doing on the assignment. For this to occur, it is important that groups have open communication and stay task focused as much as possible. It is very easy for groups to avoid making decisions and let valuable time slip away. On average, groups will meet once a week for approximately one hour. This meeting usually takes place straight before or after class. Due to their short time frame (ie. usually one semester), groups may only meet around 15 times throughout the semester. It is therefore crucial that each of these meetings is productive. To help this to occur, it is often beneficial for students to take minutes in their meetings and adopt a rotating role structure. 
An effective way to help students run effective meetings is for groups to take some form of minutes. Keeping minutes helps a group by:
While minute taking can be effective, many students (particularly first year undergraduates) do not know how to keep them. Federman Stein and Hurd (2000) has addressed this concern by providing students with a meeting report template. This template is easy to complete and covers key areas of an effective meeting. An adapted version of this template has been produced by IML and can be downloaded. It is recommended that groups receive a copy of this template before each meeting (or in bulk at the beginning of the semester). It is also advisable for students to keep copies of these minutes sheets for their own records. These copies are particularly useful for students if they are required to keep a reflective journal as part of their group assignment (see Unit 7: Helping Students Reflect on their Group Experience). 
One of the biggest problems in student-based group work is the existence of equal status (ie. each member having the same power in the group). When equal status groups meet, an informal pattern of leadership and followership will emerge almost immediately. Unfortunately, the adoption of leadership tends to be driven more by personality and often results in conflict (particularly if there is more than one dominant student in the group). Rather than let the leadership role(s) emerge, it is far better for groups to adopt a rotating role structure. 
A rotating role structure is one where the position of leadership is deconstructed and distributed or shared among the group members (rather than being bestowed on any one member). This means that all group members are responsible for a specific function or leadership duty and thus tend to be more active in group meetings. This is particularly true for students who tend to speak up less in groups (eg. through shyness, cultural norms, etc.), as they have the positional power to enact the roles. 
There are a number of functional role typologies available. The most generic comprises these five roles:
For group meetings to run effectively, it is important that these five roles are played. Rather than allowing them to emerge or be picked, it is best if these roles are randomly assigned in the first meeting and then rotated on a regular basis (eg. weekly or fortnightly). By rotating the roles, each student has the opportunity to develop skills in each role and observe it being played by the other members. Students should also be encouraged to provide each other with feedback so as to encourage peer-learning. 
UTS library has a large collection of books which contain team-building exercises. These include:
UTS also holds the serial called the Annual Handbook for Group Facilitators (UTS Call No.: City 158.2/20) which is an excellent source for team-building exercises.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/enhancing/enhancing-experiences-group-work/monitoring-groups,"This unit includes suggestions to help monitor student groups. It will focus on three key areas of group work that benefit from monitoring. These are the group's:
This unit will also touch on some strategies to help groups caught in conflict. 
To understand why groups need monitoring, it is important to understand how student groups tend to struggle. In general, groups often leave too much work to the last minute and struggle to complete their work on time. As a result, many groups are forced to rush the end product and thus fail to produce work that reflects their full potential. This last-minute rush also creates considerable tension within the group that often leads to conflict and leaves the group members with an overall negative experience. These negative experiences usually have an impact on students' attitudes towards future group work and their ability to reflect on the skills they have learned. 
There are a large number of reasons why groups tend to run out of time. Three of the main reasons are: 1) students lack the confidence to manage each other, 2) students lack the confidence to make decisions collectively, and 3) students lack the confidence to deal with conflict.
In educational settings, group members have the same status (rather than in industry where there is often a clear hierarchy in place). Under such conditions, many students find it difficult to manage each other. Students often feel uncomfortable directing other students. More so, students do not like being directed by their peers. The way students deal with the issue of equal status is to hope that everything will just ""work out"". For example, students hope that:
Unfortunately, relying on hope alone seldom works. By the time groups realise this, valuable time has already been lost. 
When groups realise that issues need to be resolved, they often adopt an approach that suits the equal status conditions within the group. This is usually a democratic approach where they attempt to cater for each member in the group. Attempting to cater for everybody's needs within the group can be difficult. This approach takes considerable time as students try to accommodate each other. 
As students struggle to cater for every member's needs and wants, they soon realise that compromise will be needed. For students, compromising can be difficult because it requires discussion and this has the potential to lead to conflict. Rather than make decisions, many groups prefer to stay ""off task"" for as long as possible. Groups will engage in small talk; they will be reluctant to share ideas (because they may cause debate); and they will be non-committal to suggestions made. To students, saying nothing is better than disagreeing. 
As each week goes by, there will be mounting pressure to begin working on the task. However, by this stage, the group's time frame is becoming too short. This pressure often leads to a large number of decisions being made with little time to discuss the issues thoroughly. This invariably leads to the conflict students wanted to avoid in the first place.
When conflict arises in the group, students usually struggle to deal with it effectively. Most students deal with conflict by adopting either a fight or flight strategy. Unfortunately, both of these strategies only result in more loss of time. Students still need to make collective decisions and reach consensus and this takes even more time.
As discussed above, student groups tend to struggle to complete their work on time due to three main factors (lacking the confidence to manage each other, make decisions together, and deal with conflict). For groups to reach their full potential, it is crucial that these factors are monitored. The key is not to prevent these factors from emerging altogether but rather to ensure that the group does not get bogged down and lose too much time. With most group assignments lasting less than one semester, groups can not afford to lose time staying ""off task"" and avoiding issues. Groups need to address issues and progress forward. In equal status groups however, students need help to address issues and stay on target. This is where the monitoring becomes crucial. 
To keep groups on track, three key aspects should be monitored. These are the group's: 1) meetings, 2) progress and 3) dynamics. 
As discussed in Unit 4: Getting Groups Started, groups need to hold regular and productive meetings. To ensure this is happening, it is important that meetings are closely monitored. As also discussed in Unit 4, groups can benefit greatly by taking minutes of their meetings. If groups keep minutes, it is therefore possible to monitor their meetings by having groups lodge their minute sheets on a regular basis. This monitoring technique can be effective because it helps students stay on track. Groups know that they have to report on their meetings each week and can't afford to skip meetings or stay off task for too long. 
Apart from monitoring meetings, the group's progress should also be closely monitored. For groups to complete their task on time, they must be continually performing at a high level. Groups need to set short term goals and ensure they achieve these goals on time. An effective way to monitor progress is to have verbal progress reports. These results should focus on the performance of the group (ie. what they have been achieving). The best way to run these sessions is for a member of each group to make a brief presentation in class (for a few minutes). This report should be conducted regularly (eg. every week or fortnight) and presented by a different member each time. 
The verbal reporting system is extremely effective because:
According to group theory, all groups go through a phase of conflict. This is an inevitable part of a group's development over time. Groups need to deal with the issues creating the conflict before moving on to high performance. 
To ensure that groups have progressed past the conflict phase, it is crucial that the group's dynamics are monitored. This is best achieved by a formal review around the group's mid-way point (eg. around week seven if the group has a full semester). While there are many team review surveys/exercises available, most are designed for industry teams and are once again not entirely applicable. IML has adapted Harshman and Phillips's (1996) team review to make it suitable for student groups at UTS. This exercise (called the ""Team Review Exercise"") can be downloaded.
If student groups are closely monitored, the chances of conflict arising (and escalating) are significantly reduced. Occasionally, however, groups can still strike difficulties and can become trapped in a cycle of conflict that will require your intervention. This unfortunately arises when groups don't take your monitoring efforts seriously (ie. can't see the point and don't do it properly) or are in conflict and don't want to bring it up (in the fear of making things worse). 
In most instances, groups slip into conflict for a number of reasons. The most common sources of conflict relate to group members:
As mentioned earlier, groups tend to avoid conflict in the hope that it will resolve itself. As such, when groups finally seek help, many weeks have past. It is not uncommon for groups to eventually seek help in the week before the assignment is due. Usually, one member or a few students of the same group will come and see you to discuss their difficulties (and ask for an extension!). At this stage, there is no point in saying things like: 
Whilst, you may be thinking many of these, it is important that you intervene promptly. Students have come to you as their last resort (because they are worried about their mark). Sometimes, lecturers will first talk with the group members individually to get the ""full story"". Usually, the root of the conflict is based around personality clashes or something blown out of all proportion. In such instances, it can often be useful to arrange and facilitate a meeting attended by all members. This meeting should not be approached as a ""T-group"" therapy session (there is not enough time); rather it should be task focused (eg. what has been agreed upon to date? What have students done thus far?). Most groups already will have made decisions earlier on (before the conflict) and this should be the starting point. Setting strict deadlines (for each member's work to be completed) are usually beneficial for the group so as to keep them task focused. Most group members will work better because they tend to put their differences aside or are too busy to let the little things worry them as much. It will probably be necessary to convene another meeting with the group to ensure that deadlines are being met and the group is functioning. 
Occasionally, groups may have gone past the point of facilitation and require more drastic action. When group members have become overly aggressive or vindictive to each other, it may be necessary to split the group up and have students work individually or in dyads. This option, however, should only be used under exceptional circumstances because it is often viewed as unfair by the other students. This is because these students have worked through their difficulties and see that the group being split up has been rewarded (by being allowed to work by themselves). This problem can often be addressed by ensuring that the mark awarded for the group assignment has a ""team work/ team process"" component which is deducted from these groups who have chosen to be separated. If this strategy is to be adopted, it is important that it is clearly discussed in your subject outline. 
Dealing with difficult issues should not be your responsibility alone. It should also be up to students to address these issues for themselves (this is part of the reason for group work in the first place). Unfortunately, students often need to be steered toward the information needed to help themselves and this topic was covered in Unit 2: Preparing Students for Group Work. It is crucial that students are made aware of the many services available to help them manage group work. It is also crucial that students see the link between the information available and how it can apply to their current situation. For example, it may be appropriate to encourage students to look at the resources availablebefore you begin any facilitation. By doing so, it is more likely that students will come up with their own solutions to resolve their conflict and be far more committed to their chosen course of action. Furthermore, it is important that after each facilitation session, students are made aware of their improvements in group functioning (ie. reward positive behaviour) and what they have learned about themselves (ie. how one has reacted to conflict; how could the same situation be avoided next time; what skills/insights have they developed throughout the situation and how can this be applied elsewhere).

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/enhancing/enhancing-experiences-group-work/assessing-groups,"This unit includes suggestions for assessing group work. It will focus on a number of alternative approaches for assessing student groups and will outline the advantages and disadvantages of each.
After groups have completed their task (or a component of it), some form of assessment usually takes place. In most instances, this assessment results in a mark being awarded to each group member (which then makes up some proportion of the student's final grade for the subject). Despite appearing easy, assessing group work can be extremely difficult. No matter how you derive each member's mark, there will always be complaints from group members. This is because some members feel they have been disadvantaged by the efforts of their fellow group members.
In general, there are three different assessment systems used to allocate a mark for group work. These are: 1) individual assessment, 2) same mark allocation and 3) weighted mark allocation. 
Many lecturers find it easier to assess all group members individually. Under this system, each group member is assessed on an individual piece of work. This may be a full product (eg. a paper, report) or a section of the product which each member has completed for the group assignment. In this context, groups are primarily used to pool resources together for all members to share (eg. data, literature). Groups are also used for the purposes of providing peer support and to encourage students to cooperate and communicate with each other. 
Lecturers employing the individual assessment system argue that it works very well. The main benefits concerns the student's satisfaction with the system. Students are satisfied with the system because:
Whilst students may be satisfied, there are critics of the individual assessment system. The main criticisms of the system are that:
Another way to assess group work is to allocate the same mark to each group member. Under this system, groups are required to submit one product for assessment. The grade for this product is then awarded to each group member. The rationale behind this system is that groups should work together on all aspects of the task and should be assessed accordingly. By doing so, members learn to operate in fully interdependent groups where they will be rewarded as a collective unit. 
Those using the same mark allocation system argue that it has many strengths. These include:
Those using the system also acknowledge that it does have problems. These include:
An increasing number of lecturers are using a weighted marking system to award marks to group members. In this system, members receive a mark comprised of both a shared and individual component. Usually it is the shared component that carries more weight with the individual component acting as a supplementary mark (usually around 5-10% of the total group mark). The weighted marking system has essentially emerged in response to the growing number of complaints from students over the use of the shared marking system. It attempts to maintain the shared marking system but at the same time acknowledge that individual contributions may vary within groups. Basically, it rewards the group as a whole but also rewards each member for their individual contribution to the group. 
Whilst the system attempts to acknowledge the differences in individual contribution, measuring this component can be complex. Most try to use some sort of peer assessment to derive at this individual mark. The most common procedure is for students to assess each other on one (usually contribution) or multiple criteria (eg. contribution, quality of work produced, participation in group meetings). Traditionally, this procedure is conducted at the end of the group assignment using a pen and paper questionnaire. Usually, students are required to write the names of their group members and assign a contribution mark (or marks) to each person. Each member's marks are then tallied to determine the individual's overall peer assessment mark. 
In recent years, efforts have been made to improve the peer assessment procedure by helping lecturers administer and then score each member's peer assessed mark. One innovation at UTS has been the development of an online assessment tool called SparkPLUS (which stands for Self and Peer Assessment Resource Kit). This assessment tool requires students to rate each member's performance (including their own) on a number of key attributes (which can be selected by the lecturer). 
Like all assessment methods, the weighted marking system has strengths and weaknesses. Its strengths are:
Its weaknesses are:
According to the UTS Assessment Policy and Procedures Manual, group work should not account for more than 30% of the total assessment in a subject. However, in specific cases, this mark can vary with the written permission of the Faculty's Responsible Academic Officer (ROA).
More information concerning the assessment of group work can be found here.
There are many excellent references dealing with the assessment of student-based group work. These include:"
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/enhancing/enhancing-experiences-group-work/helping-students-reflect,"This unit includes suggestions for helping students reflect on their group experience. It will focus on the importance of students expressing their group-based experiences in some form of learning journal or essay, to encourage the reflective process.
After groups have completed their task, they usually disband straight away. Most students still have an exam to prepare for and this will become their highest priority. Before students do disband, it is important that they take the opportunity to reflect on their group experience. 
For most students, the last few weeks of group work can be difficult. There is usually a lot of work to be done and tension is high. If students disband straight after the task has been completed, many only remember the times of tension and fail to see the positives. This unfortunately creates a distorted view of their group experience and one which may influence their motivation for future group work. 
By dwelling on the negatives, students also fail to see all of the positives of their group experience. For example, they do not see the skills they have learned through the group experience. More importantly, they do not see that these skills and experiences are the attributes which employers are looking for. Recruiters do not want to know if they have been in a group — that is a given. They want to know what students have learned from group work. What were their strengths? How did they deal with difficult situations?
There are a number of ways to help students reflect on their group experience. Three of the more popular methods are: 1) the reflective journal, 2) the reflective essay, and 3) the reflective exam question. The reflective journal
Reflective journals are becoming an increasingly popular way to encourage students to reflect on their group experience. Reflective journals are a form of personal diary that students keep throughout the length of the group project and are required to make regular entries concerning their group activities. Students are usually required to make an entry into their journal after each group meeting. These entries require students to reflect on various aspects of their group. These aspects include:
Students often report how useful it is to keep the learning journal. This is particularly so at the end of the semester as it allows the student to look back on their growth (and the group's growth) over the semester. Lecturers are also finding the reflective journal very useful for monitoring the progress and dynamics of their groups (when periodically collected and read throughout the semester). For example, lecturers report that they are able to intervene in groups having difficulties earlier and thus avoid the escalation of conflict. 
As with many learning objectives, the reflective journal works best when it is made an assessable item (most lecturers make the journal worth 10-15% of the total group mark). This encourages students to make entries in their journal and begin the reflective process. Becoming reflective is a skill which develops through practice and this skill is best facilitated by attributing some marks to the process. The reflective essay
The reflective essay is another approach that encourages student reflection. Here, students are required to write a small essay (around 1500 words) based on their group experience. This essay usually requires students to reflect on their role in the group (eg. what they did), and the skills they have learned/improved by participating in the group activity (eg. learning how to give and receive criticism). This essay is usually submitted in the same week (or the week after) the group report or product is due. Once again, this reflective process is best encouraged by making the essay assessable. The reflective exam question
Another way to encourage student reflection is to set an exam question which deals with their group experiences. Here, students are examined on what they have learned through their group activity. This examination is usually in a written form (it is often placed in the ""optional"" question section), however it can also take the form of an oral examination.
There are many excellent references dealing with student reflection and journal writing. These include:"

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment/assessing-group-work,"Collaborative group work is common at UTS because it benefits student learning. When groups work well, students learn more and produce higher quality learning outcomes.
Reviews of student feedback demonstrate that many students benefit from learning in groups as long as the groups are well managed and there are clear and fair assessment requirements. In a group assignment the students want a system that gives them every opportunity to receive a high grade that also reflects the level of contribution made by individual students.
Addressing these three aspects of assessing group assignments can reduce the students' concerns:

Once group work has been selected as an appropriate teaching and learning method, a decision is required on what aspects of the group work activity will be assessed. Lecturers can assess the product of the group work, the process of group work or observing the group dynamics first hand (Nightingale et al, 1998). The product of group work might be a report, project or poster. The process of group work would include how well the students collaborated with each other.
Successful group assessment makes it clear to the students at the start of semester how group product and group process components relate to their final grade. Not all group work needs to be assessed (UTS 2001: 10). For example introductory exercises designed to build team cohesion are often introduced early in a subject to demonstrate the expectation of cooperation in groups but not given a formal grade.
On the whole lecturers already have good methods for assessing the products of group work. The same principles of fair, reliable and equitable assessment used for assessing individual assignments can be easily applied when assessing the outcomes of the group.
When the product of group work is the only element assessed, the unintended effect can be that students tend to work individually and then combine their contributions for the final mark. This discourages collaboration and with less commitment to the group outcomes some of the group members may not contribute equally to the final assignment, perhaps withholding resources from one another or complain about ""free-riders"" not contributing to the final product (Habeshaw, et al, 1995). Assessing the product alone also has significant consequences for learning as students rely on their recognised strengths and are only effectively assessed on a limited part of the subject's learning objectives.
If the group process will be assessed, students need to be clear about the criteria. Criteria usually refer to the evidence of learning (Brown Bull & Pendlebury, 1997). Criteria for group contributions would be decided by the lecturer, the lecturer in consultation with the student or by students. All student work at UTS is marked against the stated criteria which, needs to be provided to the students in writing within the first three weeks of the semester (R 3.1.14). However, this could indicate statements such as ""criteria for assessing group contributions will be negotiated with students in week 2 of tutorials."" If the students have some experience of group work, the group itself can be involved in process of setting the criteria for group participation (Brown, Race & Smith, 1996: 123)
Merely stating the assessment criteria can encourage some potential non-participants to contribute to the group work (Race, 2000). Criteria, which are too detailed can encourage low level learning outcomes as students adopt a surface approach to learning and simply check off the assessment requirements. Developing general criteria for learning about team-work is more important than developing an exhaustive list of requirements (Winter, 1995: 66). An example of these general criteria might include:
(Brown, Bull & Pendlebury, 1997: 175)
If learning about team processes is one of the critical aims of the group assignments it will need to be monitored and assessed. Once evidence on the final outcomes of the group work has been collected, marks need to be allocated to individual students. By far the most common approach for allocating marks is to provide a single mark to all the members of a group. The lecturer would only adjust the mark on a case-by-case basis should a major problem in the group process become evident. This is a widely used method but leads to considerable dissatisfaction if students feel that marks do not fairly reflect individual contribution.
Another popular method is a combination of group and individual activities. Students receive marks awarded for a series of individual tasks that are combined with a single group mark from the group component. Gibbs (1992) cautions that any averaging of assessment items needs to be undertaken in a way that does not to bias any single task by providing it with a disproportionate weighting in relation to the other tasks. A variation on this method is to assign specific roles in the group such as coordinator, time keeper or note-taker and provide an individual mark for these roles.
Lejk & Wyvill (1996) outline nine methods of deriving individual grades from group assessments. Most involve the students deciding on how a single group mark is to be redistributed among the other group members. As a result of the reallocation some students will receive a final score above or below the group average based on the students' assessment of each other's performance. Two widely used schemes are Divided Group Marks and Peer Assessment Factors.
Habeshaw (1993) suggests a scheme in which the students distribute the total pool of marks between themselves. The group mark is multiplied by the number of students in the group to provide a pool of marks to be redistributed. Students can either allocate individual marks from the pool or allocate percentages based on performance in agreed criteria. In the second case an average of the student's combined marks normally becomes their final grade.
Goldfinch (1994) presents a widely used scheme for determining the individual's effort in comparison with other members of the group. It forms the basis for the SPARK web-based program developed at UTS described in greater detail in the IML Assessment Guide 1.3 . To calculate the final mark a single group mark is given by a lecturer is manipulated to derive an individual mark by multiplying a peer assessment factor with the group mark. The peer assessment factor is a confidential score nominated anonymously by each of the other group members.
The peer assessment score is arrived at by each member of the group scoring the other members against agreed criteria using a scale of 1 to 3, with 3 representing a contribution that is better than the others in the group, while 1 is a contribution that is less than the others in the group. Goldfinch includes a 0 score for no help at all in that particular criterion and a -1 score for a hindrance to the group.
The sum of each individual peer assessment score gives an individual total that is divided by the average peer assessment mark for the group. The final peer assessment factor is derived from the peer assessment score and the percent of an individual's mark taken from the group mark.
Gibbs (1992) provides a variation of peer assessment factor in which all students receive the average group score plus a peer allocated score. Each student receives an above average (+1 or +2) or below average (-1 or -2) score nominated by the other group members added to the group average. The only condition is that the average of the moderated mark must be the same as the group mark.
The average quality of the final submissions may be significantly higher in well functioning teams but simply giving all students the same mark may reward students who contribute the least. Students want a fair and reliable method of attaining their marks and need to be assured that their contribution to both groups' outcomes and processes are important. A second guide on group work provides advice on assigning individual grades.
To ensure fair group assessment lecturers at UTS who assess students in groups suggest the following:"
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment/online-assessment/assessing-online-discussion,"Both email and online discussions are commonly used to provide feedback for students on their assignments. Regular users of these approaches caution that it cannot be assumed that all students know how to use online technologies. Your class may be their first experience with online learning and so there is a danger that they may not perform as well online as you expect. As a consequence it is a good practice to introduce your students to the features of Canvas.
The main advantage of online technology identified by lecturers at UTS is the greater flexibility in providing faster feedback on their students work. Students also like the immediacy implied by being online. It gives them a greater opportunity to communicate with their lecturers and tutors. While the online environment is a good forum for communication and group discussions, the more immediate nature of communication can create expectations among students that their lecturers will respond to their requests instantly.
Academic who provide online feedback to their students comment that responding to the volume of personal email messages from students can become time-consuming if not closely managed. They recommend an alterative approach whereby students are required to post questions online. This is one way lecturers can make themselves available to a large group of students and still allow individual students to ask questions and receive answers that everyone can see. As with all feedback lecturers need to clearly indicate the likely turn-around time it will take for them to respond to student questions.
A number of lecturers report that there are some students who will not contribute in the online environment unless it is part of an assessment task. One way to encourage reluctant student participation is to allow them to ask their questions anonymously. Even when students answer each other’s questions they can be permitted to do so anonymously. This system has worked in Business, Engineering and Law, though anonymous posting raises its own challenges of monitoring mischievous behaviour.
When participation in online discussions is required as part of the criteria for the subject, lecturers needs to determine how the online interactions will be assessed. Online discussion forums are somewhere between tutorial discussions and essays in style. They have the informality of a tutorial but provide a permanent written record of what was discussed. It is usual to assess the extent a student contributes to the discussion and how they draw on the resources of the subject to formulate their answers (Lea, 2001). As with essays, coherence, style and presentation may all be essential criteria that are assessed in the students’ online contributions."

Technology Assessment is the final compulsory subject within the BE Dip Eng. Prac Degree. Students come from all fields of engineering practice where most of their learning has had a focus on developing technical skills. Once the students graduate as engineers they will need to be able incorporate multiple perspectives, whether political, social or economic, into their work. One of the main outcomes of the subject is the ability for students to adopt multiple stakeholders' perspectives and to integrate these perspectives into the final decision-making.
Technology Assessment aims to reflect on the interdisciplinary nature of engineering activity by having inter-disciplinary class teams like those generally used in practice to tackle technology assessments. The subject adopts a role-based learning structure where students develop the skills for involving the community to determine the impact of engineering activity.
The role-play activity starts in week 5 of the semester following a process of reading and online quizzes to test their comprehension of key readings on Technology Assessment. The online controversy takes a week to complete, which is considered enough time to flush out all the issues focused around a multidimensional engineering problem. A scenario is chosen for it's cross disciplinary nature so that the issues explored are relevant to all forms of engineering.
To complete the online debate the students self-select into groups of four who choose one scenario from among a few different topics. Having between 200 and 300 students in final year engineering required three debates to be running at one time, with two topics running at the same and one totally separate topic. Students can only see their own forum and the responses of the other stakeholders in that forum.
The range of stakeholder groups is organised ahead of time once the topic of the debate has been determined. Each stakeholder group receives a short biography that outlines their role and it is then up to each group to research the stakeholder's perspective further.
For any debate there might be as many as 25 stakeholders coming into a forum. Students choose their stakeholder group and need to advocate on behalf of their stakeholder, researching the issues from their point of view and challenging alternative views. In assessing the online controversy the reflection on the task is separated out from the performance in the debate.
Three sets of data are collected to evaluate the quality of participation in the group. The first is called the ""People's Choice Awards"" where the students assess themselves using the quiz function on Canvas. After analysing their contributions to the forum students will rank which stakeholder group provided the most convincing discussion of the issues. Students complete the quiz by answering questions on each of the contributors to the forum with the results used to distribute the final student marks.
The student's choice is compared with the marks allocated by the tutor and lecturer. The tutors go through the postings using the same criteria as the student to give a mark and written feedback on where contributions were consistent with research and showed an appreciation of participatory design. This is repeated by the lecturer who likewise goes through all the postings follow the same criteria as the students. It is the combination of the students, tutors and lecturers mark that make up the final assessment.
In addition to judging their collaborative performance students are asked to individually reflect on the process. To assess their participation in the activity students have to step back and act like a policy analyst, reviewing their online postings to write a reflective statement incorporating the major issues that arose out of that forum."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment/online-assessment/assessing-online-discussion/assessing-online-discussion-group,"Meredith Jones, Humanities & Social Sciences
""Virtual Communities: Communication History"" is a subject about online communities and social interaction in online worlds. As part of the subject the 25 undergraduate students experience what it is like to be part of an online digital community. The assessment of the online discussion is the part of the subject that the students have had the least experience with and the students get detailed information in the subject outline explaining to them what they need to do online.
The online discussion is 20% of their final mark and involves the students contributing a minimum of 1500 words to an open forum over the entire semester. The purpose of posting online is that students can read each other's contributions and comment on them. Meredith has found that the online forum provides opportunities for students who are not talkative in the classroom to participate in the discussions. To ensure regular involvement there is a minimum word count of 50 words for each week, which is intended to stop students from putting their entire 1500 words in the last week. There is no maximum word limit.
The students are asked to try and relate their discussions to the readings that are set for each week. Generally the first threads are almost always about the readings but by the end of semester a thread that was started in the first week that is still going has transformed into a broader discussion about globalisation or the impact of different technologies. As long as the students keep on interacting in a suitably scholarly way, there is no limit to what they discuss.
The lecturer does not read every piece of work as it comes throughout the semester but keeps abreast of the broad movements in the students' postings. By the end of semester she has a general idea of what themes are being discussed. To assess their online discussion she uses the ordering tool in Canvas to sort each student's contributions into a list and as a result can get an instant impression of how much they have done each week.
After sorting the entries Meredith then checks that they have reached the required word limit. This is also a relatively straightforward process as each student writes how many words they wrote at the end of every input and then calculates their on-going word count. There is no penalty for missing weeks as long as there is a gradual accumulation of words throughout the semester
The lecturer then reads through the students entire contributions for a semester determining how each one applied to the general themes that emerged in the online discussion. The students receive half their marks for their engagement with the topics and their understandings of the areas, plus their use of the theorists from the readings. The other half of their final assessment is based on how much they have interacted with the other postings in the forum. The students will get the highest marks when there is a good balance of engagement with the text and the ideas in the subject along with a very interactive conversational approach towards their fellow students."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment/online-assessment/online-examinations,"Students find a number of benefits in online examinations. It is well known that many students suffer from anxiety when faced with large, end-of-semester exams. Sambell, Sambell and Sexton (1999) found that their students reported less exam anxiety when computer assessments were a component of continuous assessment throughout the semester as each test did not represent a high level of risk for the students and they were able to build their confidence in their abilities along the way. Students particularly appreciated the opportunity to do practice tests online, reporting that they assisted them in knowing what to study and they helped them to pace their revision so they did not just cram for the final exam.
Harvey and Mogey (1999) suggest the advantage of online assessment is the possibility to introduce more variables into the structure of the assessment pattern so that computer-based tests can be offered at different times, locations or even different tests to different students. As issues of security, access and equity, support and training for students are resolved summative online testing will be one more strategy for managing large volumes of marking and administration that has the potential to generate efficiencies that can ease academic workloads.
This guide is intended as a resource for UTS staff to become familiar with the issues behind online examinations. It draws from a number of recent studies on online assessment and on interviews with staff and students on the assessment practices in different sections of UTS. This guide presents information and examples on using question banks and student authentication. A second guide on online assessment deals with assessing online discussions. Strategies for setting up an online examination are listed at the end of this guide.
The idea that computers can automate marking is one of the attractions of putting assessments online. As attempts to grade student essays are still in their infancy (Shermis, Mzumara, Olson & Harrington, 2001), the major focus of online testing has been on multiple-choice questions (MCQ). MCQs have a long association with computer-assisted assessment and are relatively easy to convert to an online format. As with all MCQs it is the question design that makes multiple-choice tests effective. An important but time-consuming procedure in MCQ examinations is to produce a test that differentiates between levels of intellectual ability. These questions take more time to create but once produced they offer flexibility in the delivery of examinations and efficiency can be gained through a computer calculating and recording student marks. Pritchett (1999) cautions that even with careful question design it is difficult to assess the highest-level outcomes, like synthesis and evaluation, by using multiple-choice responses.
As with all assessment, MCQs should test clearly identified learning outcomes and be integrated into the course rather than treated as an afterthought. An advantage of using MCQs online is the ease in scheduling an examination once you have a pool of questions. Known as ""question banks"", these are a store of large numbers of questions in one subject area (The wall, 2000). For any particular test questions can be selected from the bank at random. Questions in the bank are often organised by level of difficulty or different values within a standard question randomised to create slightly different questions. Having randomised questions with the same structure and level but different content is considered to also deter cheating as there is no advantage by seeing another student's exam paper (Harvey and Mogey, 1999). For this to be effective the question bank needs to be large enough to prevent high levels of repetition.
As a general rule a well maintained computer system is less likely to fail than one used only occasionally for online examinations. UTSOnline places a range of online assessment technologies within a single framework familiar to the students that is available to students 24 hours a day and has technical backup for the situation when an emergency does happen. Regardless of what computer system you use, you will need a contingency plan in case there are any technical faults in the middle of the examination period that may prevent student from completing the exam and disadvantaging their results.
The key to any plan is to keep the students and colleagues informed of what action you intend to take and what action they are expected to take. Depending on how long the problem exists Harvey and Mogey (1999) suggest some solutions to computer failures is to add the time missed to the end of the exam, reducing the number of questions or allocate students some marks in compensation. Zakzewski and Christine (2000) suggest ensuring there are spare machines available in the laboratory in case of machine failure so that a student can quickly be moved to a new machine. If the crash occurs later in the examination they recommend the student complete paper copies of the exam. They also propose that when there are multiple sessions scheduled the student can do the exam with another group or be referred to the Faculty's Appeals Committee for special consideration. Should the whole network fail the examination needs to be rescheduled.
On the whole lecturers are still wary of setting examinations online. When the students are off-site their main concern is with student authentication. They want to be sure they know who exactly is 'pushing the buttons' in the exam. Even though there is no way to ensure the identity of a student at a remote assessment site the greater concern to many lecturers is how to ensure that students did not receive outside assistance to improve their test score. One approach is to make all off-site online examinations formative and open-book exams.
Where examinations are conducted in a laboratory environment it needs to be recognised that computer labs are rarely set up for testing. Wintington (1999) argues that all computers to be used under exam conditions need to be audited. Computers connected to the Internet are difficult to make secure and he cautions that occupational health and safety issues are particularly important in longer exams. If the timing of the exam is automated then consideration needs to be made for students with special needs. Finally, to maximise securing the questions in any summative examinations should only be stored online at the last possible moment."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment/online-assessment/suggestions-online-assessment,As with any new technology online assessment tools take time to learn and require careful planning if their implementation is not going to increase workload or add cost to Faculties. Lecturers at UTS using online assessment suggest:
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment/types-assessment/projects,"Project work is an attempt to introduce genuine problems into education. In it students have to use their initiative to identify problems they wish to solve or questions they wish to explore, decide on the information, materials, equipment which they need and how they can obtain them, use this information to plan the work, attempt to solve the problem or answer the question and present their results coherently. The way to assess project work is indicated by the above list of activities which constitute the work. Thus each of the following activities needs to be addressed separately: identification and formulation of the problem information and resources needed planning the work solving the problem or answering the question presentation, discussion and interpretation of the results critique of the work and recommendations for further work.
If only one assessment item (the project report or the project product) is used, it is important that students receive meaningful feedback during the progress of the project. Such feedback ought to assist the learning process and provide students with an approximate idea of their chances of passing the subject. If this is not done, students will concentrate their main efforts on the final product and not on the work preceding it. Most projects are assessed on more than the final report or product, by including forms such as oral examinations, observation, assessment of methodology, etc.
The great advantages of project work in higher education also create many problems. Projects provide a means through which a topic can be covered in depth (but the assessment becomes a time consuming and subjective task). The project requires students to undertake independent study and enquiry (but this creates differences in equality of tasks, and in the development common marking schemes). Projects encourage students to work together in groups (but student contributions are not always equivalent, and awarding grades is a problem). Some of these issues are addressed through the use of general assessment criteria. Examples are included at the end of this section. Group work is addressed below.
A proportion of project work is conducted by students in groups. Some of the advantages of group work include the enhanced learning resulting from combining the knowledge and experiences of several students, the fact that this type of work is more closely allied to the type of work many students will experience in their careers, and that the quantity of marking can be reduced. One of the major disadvantages felt by many staff (and students) is the injustice of awarding one mark to a group in which the contributions from individual students have not been equivalent.
A submission from the School of Teacher Education suggested that in group projects or assignments that have an overall assessment weighting of over 20%, students should be given the option of an individual mark.
One way of achieving this is to award the group one mark, but allow them to decide how that mark should be distributed among them. For example, if a group containing five members achieves a project mark of 60%, the group will be given 300 marks (60 x 5) and asked to allocate a mark for each person where no one can be given less than zero or more than 100 and the total is 300. Students will have to agree on the criteria being used to make this decision, and may learn some negotiating skills in the process. They can be asked to prepare for this negotiation by keeping minutes of meeting, diaries of events, drafts of contributions, etc.

The first example is taken from the Department of Applied Physics Final Year Project. Before students undertake a project they are given an extensive document on various aspects of doing and writing up a project. The following extract is taken from this document and describes explicitly the way a major project is assessed.
Students will be assessed on their experimental, theoretical and laboratory skills and how they go about their project. At the start of a project there is a lot to learn and many students take 2 or 3 weeks to build up the confidence necessary to operate a piece of equipment or use a set of equations. In most instances students will not be assessed during this stage of their project. This is the time for learning from others such as the laboratory technician or student supervisor.
Students should be aware that there comes a time when they need to demonstrate that they can work and think independently. Students will be assessed on two components: the manner in which they carry out their project (assessed primarily by the supervisor) and the project report. The report is assessed by the supervisor and at least one other member of staff. When there are serious discrepancies between the two results, other members are asked to grade the report.
All completed projects are presented at a Project Assessment Meeting attended by all academic staff of the Department. All the marks awarded are discussed at this meeting and a final mark assigned to the project. In determining a mark, considerable emphasis is also placed on the degree of difficulty of the tasks on which the student actually worked and the quality of an achievement.
A number of factors are considered when assessing how well a project is carried out. It is worth emphasising that the list of criteria given below is not meant to be exhaustive. All projects are unique and any particular project may possess features not included in the list below. Alternatively, some of the items listed may be irrelevant. The assessment criteria therefore, must be tailored to the project.
Criteria include:
Much of the assessment guide presented below was drawn up by Prosser & Cunningham (1983) to improve project report assessment at Griffith University. These criteria were used to develop those used at UTS. It should again be emphasised that there is no universal set of assessment guidelines; these have to be tailored according to the type of project undertaken.

Most mathematics subjects fairly rigid.
""with tests and assignments there's little choice of tasks or where they want to take their learning, except in Honours.""
Students work in groups on a project of their own choosing that applies the principles and skills taught in the subject.
 ""In general, students are totally responsible for applying the knowledge and skills they have learnt.""
 Students choose area of study
""This is based on consensus within the group and the lecturer confirms if their choices are appropriate or not and why.""
 Some degree of flexibility in assessment tasks.
 ""Not all students are good at a particular aspect, so a rigid assessment would disadvantage certain students because they might have skills in another area.""
Degree of flexibility dependant on level of students.
""Honours and Postgraduate students can be given more responsibility.""
Encouraging students to be responsible for their own learning. They feel more involved in their learning process from the assessment side.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/key-assessment-elements,"Assessment practices can be constructed from elements combined into an appropriate task. While terms like self assessment, peer assessment, self-testing, feedback, are familar, it can be more useful to focus on the specific aspects from which tasks are built. The features of an activity that contribute to learning can then be identified and new combinations made to suit a wide range of circumstances.
Many elements have the potential to be used beyond their original study area.
Assessment elements discussed here include:
Assessment is intrinsic to learning; good assessment contributes to learning as well as to grading.
This is a smorgasbord of ideas rather than an agenda to be followed. It would be unusual for a very large number of the elements discussed to be part of a course."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/key-assessment-elements/engaging-students,"The prerequisite for any learning is involvement in tasks throughout a program of study. Research tells us that time spent on a task is the most important characteristic of effective learning. Tasks that position all students, not just the enthusiastic or most active ones, to see themselves as responsible for their own learning are needed. Unless students experience some kind of emotional investment in what they are doing, they will be unable to commit to many of the useful assessment tasks that are available.
A wide range of activities can be used, including:
Such actitivities can provide a foundation for participation in the subject matter.
Encouraging participation in classes, even very large ones, is a means of positioning students as active learners and is a prerequisite for any assessment activity that fosters learning.
In large classes, technological devices have been found useful. For example, personal response systems that allow students to respond to questions posed by the lecturer and have the class profile displayed, followed by discussion of answers, are used in a variety of disciplines.
See an example from Biology.
Activities can show students that they understand what they are doing. Such activities require a response (not necessarily formal grades) and include means for a student to judge whether they are successful or not.
The earlier students begin to engage in significant learning tasks during their course, the sooner they can establish effective study habits and develop their capacity to monitor their own work. A balance needs to be achieved between over-organising students, thereby generating dependence on teachers, and leaving them to work autonomously.
A common exercise used in first year in many disciplines is providing students with anonymous examples of the same assignment from other students. The students are asked to individually grade the assignment and identify the differences that led to the allocation of different grades. Discussion follows about the qualities of a good assignment, how it can be recognised and how they can produce successful assignments for themselves. See ASKe marking workshops.
This helps students understand the differences between excellent and satisfactory work, without having to expose their own work to critical scrutiny. It also develops a practical understanding of assessment standards and criteria through an activity that benefits students as they see how work gets marked by tutors.
+Variation: Provide students with standards and criteria and ask them to use these in the grading process. Follow this with discussion of standards and criteria.
Students identify standards and criteria to apply to their own work and that of their peers. They can draw on various sources including their own expertise and experience, the context in which they are operating and professional standards (if available). They agree on appropriate criteria with a group of peers facilitated by a staff member, who may suggest additional criteria.
This takes the appreciation of criteria and standards one step further from 'judging samples of others' work' (see above). Instead of drawing criteria from the work of others, they take their own anticipated assignment and consider how that might be judged.
The activity can involve a structured process, such as nominal group technique, to ensure all opinions are heard and considered efficiently."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/key-assessment-elements/authentic-activities,"‘Real’ tasks can motivate and stimulate students more than the same material in abstract form. Authentic tasks reflect what occurs in settings beyond the educational environment.
They need to be experienced as authentic by students, rather than having all of the aspects of a full professional problem. Tasks may need to be simplified if they would lead to students being swamped or overloaded with material and issues they are not ready to handle yet.
Authentic tasks often require students to identify a problem from the context and to address it in ways that a practitioner would.
When authentic environments are created within a course, 'real' assessment tasks can readily be produced. However, such tasks may be created without an entire simulated environment.
While authentic tasks may obviously be undertaken in an external practice setting, the emphasis here is on utilising them as a normal part of course activity within the university.
See an example from Pharmacy
The outcomes of tasks are represented in formats used in real practice settings, e.g. oral reports rather than written ones, presentations to community groups, products for a client, a 'pitch' for film production or to a public relations company, reports to managers, etc.
This gives students practice in re-organising their work to suit different kinds of production. The process enables students to see their own learning through the perspectives of others eg. clients, managers.
This includes investigations with unknown outcomes, requiring the identification and formulation of a problem. It requires investigation planning and theoretical and/or empirical exploration which leads to an outcome justified by evidence. These tasks are not fully determined and students have to decide what is required and what would constitute successful completion.
While these typically occur at the end of a program, they can be used throughout as a means of having students integrate their knowledge and apply it. The challenge of a problem in a specific context provides a focus for how academic knowledge can be usefully deployed.
The topic or project details may be suggested by students (if a strategy for ensuring student buy-in is adopted) or by staff . They can range from a project-like activity within a module to an extended research activity consuming a major part of a student’s workload.
Projects also provide good links between teaching and research.
See Brew (2006)
Students define goals, prepare a learning plan, establish how the outcomes will be judged and negotiate an agreement with their teacher before undertaking it. The plan can be for a small or large part of the course. Renegotiation occurs after discussion with an advisor. Negotiation of the first plan takes some time, but this rapidly decreases for subsequent plans. See Anderson, Boud and Sampson (1996) about learning contracts.
Learning agreements can be used to structure projects (as in projects and research oriented investigations - see above) or in their own right as ways of undertaking study. They ensure a joint understanding of a study plan and reassure students in advance that if they complete their plan they will successfully complete the course.
In work-based settings negotiation can be a three-way process with a workplace advisor also being involved.
See Boud and Solomon (2001)"
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/key-assessment-elements/students-design-assessments,"A demanding test of whether students understand what they are doing is for them to create the means for judging it. Designing assessments involves students creating and justifying assessment activities as a whole or in part with others. Student designed assessments may or may not be used formally as a summative assessment.
Students prepare a marking rubric for an assessment task. A rubric itemises the criteria for a piece of work, outlining the characteristics and qualities needed to successfully complete the task.
Overuse of rubrics by teachers can inhibit students’ capacity to develop their own judgement. However it can be useful at early stages and in assuring consistency across staff. Assistance in moving students from accepting teachers rubrics to creating them is needed over a course.
Working in pairs or small groups, students construct their own test, for use after moderation in their final assessment for a module. They construct responses for correct and incorrect achievement.
Peer dialogue and feedback during test construction focuses attention on standards and understanding the subject matter being tested and ways in which it might be misunderstood. Preparing responses to correct and incorrect answers enables students to show their own understanding to tutors.
+Variation:  A comprehensive test may be drawn from those constructed by students and feedback provided on the outcomes. See Nicol (2007)
When courses are entirely negotiated or when they are centred on work-based learning, the idea of learning agreements can be extended over the whole program.
Students identify their current competencies (see reviewing what is and is not known), have them validated, plan a program of study and propose how it would be appropriately assessed (including the criteria).
These agreements would be negotiated and signed-off by an academic advisor and, in the case of a work-based program, a workplace advisor. 
See Boud and Solomon (2001)"
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/key-assessment-elements/integrative-tasks,"Assessment activities often fragment knowledge rather than consolidating it in ways that might be used in practice.
By contrast, integrative activities are intended to link different kinds of work within a module, across modules and stages (e.g. years and semesters, or between the course and practice settings.
See also Projects and research-oriented investigations
Students assemble and re-process their work from different sources or parts of the course, often reflecting and analysing their own work.
Students repackage earlier assignments to prompt reflection on themes beyond those for which the tasks were originally completed.
Integration involves a sequence of linked assessments over several tasks.
It can include developing an assignment in stages (see above, Integrative activities) or having a set of compatible assessment tasks that together build capacity for further learning and develop skills in making judgements.
These activities develop students' knowledge and skills base and allow them to demonstrate a range of learning outcomes in coherent ways relevant to the module.
Students receive cases to study two weeks before an examination. The exam tests integration of knowledge across different areas, in various forms eg. short answer or multiple choice. It requires knowledge of application which cannot be found in the cases or set texts alone. Students often cooperate by organising study groups to explore the cases before the exam.
The overall test is a way of testing this integration.
See Segers (1997)
In programs that are fragmented, a final task (which may be the equivalent of a course or course module) is an assignment that demonstrates the learning achieved across prior courses. This is typically the final activity of a program or degree. No new subject matter is studied; rather emphasis is placed on forming links between different areas, demonstrating connections and achievement of overall program outcomes.
See this description from Indiana State University.
A patchwork text assessment consists of a number of discrete and complete tasks. When assembled together the tasks produce an overall representation of the range of learning outcomes needed for a course.
The separate pieces are shared with other students and a reflexive commentary on the pieces is constructed for the final production.
See Winter (2003).
Assessments can be organised so that each task contributes part of the overall generic or graduate attributes for a unit or course. Students can rate their own achievements and compare them to the staff's expected outcomes, not only in terms of the task but also with regard to their overall attributes. An example is the ReView program.
ReView provides online access by students to a teacher's feedback on assessment activities. With direct linking of assessment criteria to the encompassing graduate attribute, ReView enables the student to develop a more holistic understanding of their performance on a given task. The student is also able to see how they performed on a given criteria in relation to the performance of the rest of the class on that criteria. Grades, rather than numbers, are used for the feedback because this is a more effective way of communicating to a student the quality of their work. As well, teachers report that marking is much easier to carry out.
Graduate attributes can also be recorded and tracked through learning portfolios. For an example, see UNSW medicine ePortfolio
Students keep a record of their learning and observations across a wide range of activities  in learning portfolios, journals, etc. Some stress reflection, others integration across activities or modules, the linking of practice placements with theoretical material, noticing process, etc. They can take a conventional written form—either free-flowing or according to a template/standard contents—or electronically—as an e-portfolio or blog. 
See Australian ePortfolio Project
See UNSW medicine ePortfolio"
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/key-assessment-elements/learning-and-judgement,"An important part of student development is becoming an active learner. Such learners take control of their own learning, and plan and monitor what they do. They are reflexive about the selection of tasks, timing of activities, identification of what counts as 'good' work and they are pro-active. Psychologists refer to this as self-regulated learning. The challenge of a good course is to bring out these features in all students, not just the 'good' students.
Students gain practice in selecting learning tasks suited for their level of understanding of a topic. The ability to make judicious choices does not come readily to all students and many need assistance in learning features of the tasks they need to take account of.
Knowing the next level of complexity of a task that can be tackled is an important part of organising one’s learning. Students capable of self-monitoring can choose learning activities that match their level of competence and extend it progressively.
Self-testing encompasses any activity in which a student receives knowledge from a person, book or automated system about the correctness or appropriateness of a response to a question.
Self-testing may be used to calibrate ones judgement against peers or experts or determining what one has yet to know. The key to self-testing is incorporation of the results into further study.
Students take tests and indicate not only what they believe to be the correct answers, but also their degree of confidence in their being right.
This can prompt reflection and awareness about what is known and not known.
Confidence marking can be used for tasks with self-generated marks or even conventional multiple-choice items when suitable distracters are built into items.
When work is returned to students, it only includes comments, not marks. Marks are provided at a later stage.
Evidence shows that students may not read comments when a grade is provided with them.
Students are more likely to consider and engage with feedback when it is not accompanied by a mark or grade.
An example is the REview system, where comments on students work and students self-perception of their work are presented and considered before/separately from grades. 
Tasks are used which involve students reflecting on their learning activities, their practice during a placement, their feelings or their changing understanding and making sense of them.
Because of the emotional dimension, marks and grades can inhibit reflection. Working in contexts that are experienced as safe and accepting can enhance it.
This may occur in many different ways—through keeping personal journals, portfolios or blogs, through debriefing activities with others, or expressive means (eg. re-enactment).
At the start of a module students are asked to rate their knowledge and skill on a set of topics or competencies, and rate where they want to be by the end. This is repeated at the end of the module when students rate their present knowledge and skill and indicate how much more they need to appreciate about each item.
This does not represent actual competence, but perceived competence, and students should not mistake one for the other.
Such an exercise could be used at various stages in a longer course. [See use of Knowles's (1975) questionnaire about competences — Learning Resource G, H].
Students create summaries of their achievements for portrayal to third parties (eg. employers). [Purposeful portrayals of learning]
Example: As the final task in the final unit of a Masters course, students produce a two-page summary of what they have learned in a form that can be attached to their CV and read by prospective employers."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/key-assessment-elements/modelling-and-practice,"Students experience models of good work. This may range from observing the lecturer explain how an expert approaches an issue and noticing the key features to practising for themselves what they know, and don't know, and identifying ways of bridging this gap.
Students use model answers or worked examples to identify what they do and do not know.
They identify key steps, important features or aspects they found difficult to follow (either after attempting the same problem or with examples before a problem is attempted.)
Students see how an expert would approach a problem by engaging with detailed examples.
+Variations: Seeing teachers or tutors work through problems posed to them. This contrasts with lectures where problems well known to the lecturer are demonstrated.
An extension of this is the discussion of model answers and worked examples with peers.
Students work on problems or challenges associated with the material presented to them.
There are many occasions in which students are expected to acquire knowledge or skills without enough time to engage with the academic content they are expected to learn. Opportunities for practice should be embedded as part of any program.
How this is achieved will vary greatly depending on the type of course, student expectations and how they have been previously treated. It is impossible to learn skills without considerable practise.
Examples:
Students practice developing skills like spatial ability in engineering using simulated environments. See ALTC, 2009.
Students practice diagnosis, communication and clinical skills on a digital/ virtual patient in Pharmacy. See ALTC, 2009.
Students rework their own work through progressive improvement and iterations. This may be the same work—eg rewriting the same report—or a staged task where the next step is added after revisions based on comments.
This enables students to experience producing high quality work, and to appreciate the features of excellent work, which is something they may not have engaged with previously.
Students control the pace of their learning. Progression through the course depends on completion of each task, as new material is not encountered until competence has been proven. This approach helps students develop a secure base for further learning.
'Mastery' approaches structure courses around units that need to be completed before moving on to the next, with tests that can either be passed, or not yet passed. There is no notion of failure, just not ready to proceed further now.
Such approaches have been used in mathematics, physics, economics, or in skill-based areas when considerable amounts of practice are needed to attain proficiency.
In time dependent courses (the most common in higher education), students fit in further practice alongside the introduction of new material."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/key-assessment-elements/working-peers,"In most employment, working with and learning from peers is the most common form of development. Being able to collaborate, get feedback and contribute to peer learning is probably the most vital skill in learning today. Working with others may need to be supported with guidelines and structured activities to prepare students, together with debriefing sessions and reports of group activities to tutors.
It also includes peer feedback.
Peer coaching involves pairs or groups of students working together to prepare themselves for the tasks in a course. This could be informal (eg. in the movie, The Paper Chase, where students worked in informal study groups to cope with a highly competitive course structure] or as preparation for a group member being assessed by a tutor on behalf of the others. For example, students teach each other prior to a tutor selecting one of them at random to be tested. The grade of all members of the group is determined solely by the outcome of one of their members, ensuring that preparation is taken seriously.
Learning from one’s peers is the commonplace form of learning in almost all workplaces and provides practice in working together.
This differs from group assessment (see below) as the task assessed is an individual one, not one done jointly by the group.
Students produce commentaries or assistance to help other students understand the tasks they are expected to undertake. This occurs when these tasks are unfamiliar or when they may be misinterpreted by others, eg. in how to work with reflective activities, or how to operate during placements, etc.
This provides a rehearsal and engagement with academic tasks and the standards of performance expected from them. The criterion for creating of guidelines or advice is that it encourages productive student engagement and addresses their concerns.
Students work together on a joint task for the same grade.
The aim of group assessment is to help students work together on a common outcome and realise that in employment they will often be judged collectively rather than individually.
Overly simplified approaches to group assessment can generate student disquiet, but there is sufficient evidence to show how this can be done well.
See these examples on Assessing group work in media and communications, Principles of assessing group work and Assessing group tasks
In small groups, students negotiate with each other to produce a common assessment for a task, justifying it against standards and criteria. These group assessments may also be moderated by members of the group by identifying the individual contributions made.
Group self-assessments enable students to discuss standards and criteria that apply to their work. This dialogue can help with exposing misunderstandings and appreciations that do not occur in self-assessment of individual work.
These may be individually or group assessed, but the task involves co-operative planning, organising the group and reaching common outcomes.
Negotiating co-operation and dealing with issues that arise can focus attention on how to work with others, how to organise work collaboratively and how to judge outcomes of joint work.
Click on this example from University of Canberra to see how the issues, planning and organisation of group assessment are discussed through examples from media production. See also the final report to ALTC (2008).
Many activities involve students in defining and solving problems. Some activities are well-established, eg. in problem-based learning groups, syndicate groups, problem solving exercises.
Such activities involve peers working together, expressing their uncertainties, reflecting on challenges, assisting each other and arriving at problem definitions and solutions that require more than individual effort. Some approaches to learning have been organised entirely according to such principles.
See Team-Based Learning™"
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/key-assessment-elements/giving-and-receiving-feedback,"Students need to learn if what they are doing is appropriate, if it communicates to others and whether their own views correspond to those of others. The usual term used for this process is feedback. However, feedback involves more than simply getting comments. To be effective it should consider the needs of the person receiving it and ensure that it is in a form that can be used. 
The term feedback can only be accurately used if the information provided is received and acted upon. Feedback information can only be well formulated if there is good knowledge of how it is likely to be used. Feedback may be directed to the improvement of a particular task or type of task, or to build students' capacities as learners more widely.
Students give comments to other students. Providing guidelines for giving and receiving feedback (pdf) can assist students to make helpful comments that contribute to their peers' work.
Benefit flows to both the giver and receiver of comments. The giver has to formulate  their views in ways that take account of the work and the standards and criteria that apply to it, engaging more deeply with the subject matter. The giver also must evaluate the situation and the receiver's needs, thereby developing their communicative expertise.
See a discussion of this at Issues for students to consider.
Students brief the assessor on the kinds of feedback they require on an assignment. Comments on requested matters are provided , though comments may also be provided to prompt further thinking in areas where the student appears to have a 'blind spot'. This helps them adjust their own judgement. In a sequence of assignments over a semester or year, this creates an extended dialogue between student and assessor.
The dialogue involved in requesting feedback provides student engagement and negotiation of meaning about the treatment provided in the assignment. ontinuity of assessor can assist with building consistency of feedback.
+Variation: discussions are held between the student and assessor after comments have been provided.
Example: Students respond to earlier teacher feedback on their work as the second stage of an assignment in English Literature to improve writing and reflection skills. Download AfL CETL Case study 1 (pp 4-10): Montgomery and Mc Dowell (2008) pdf (33pages).
See also Issues for students to consider
This can include simple self-testing (through set questions with answers and guidance on wrong answers), but more powerfully includes teachers, peers, practitioners, etc.
Calibrating judgements against peers in the context of agreed standards can increase student motivation and engagement.
Example: see ReView online criteria based assessment where students rate their assignments against course criteria and gain feedback from teachers, separate of marks. 
A formal debate or adversarial setting can utilise positive competition that raises the quality of work and judgement of performance.
Feedback is immediate and detailed and debriefing of participants may be needed. The purpose is to create a setting in which students are highly committed and emotionally involved in making an argument.
Commonly used in the law practice of mooting, it could be used more widely. The judge need not be a noted authority on the topic.
See Snape and Watt (2010)"
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/conceptual-framework,"Assessment Futures is based on the proposition that assessment in higher education has been so distorted by concerns about certification and justification that the core purposes at the heart of higher education and, necessarily, assessment have been obscured. Whatever else it does, assessment must support learning. More than this, it must support the processes of learning that students need beyond the point of graduation. Assessment must foster the kinds of attitudes and dispositions, as well as the knowledge and skills, learners need for the variety of tasks they will be confronted with throughout their lives. This means that our conception of assessment needs to move beyond that of testing what has been taught, or measuring learning outcomes, to encompass one that builds the capacity of students to be effective assessors for themselves and for others.
This does not mean that certification of students is not important, or that we should not do it well. Rather, it means that before assessment is subject to other requirements it must foster the kinds of learning and the building of capacity that students need to make judgements. Therefore, the first question to be asked of assessment should never be: Is it reliable and consistent? Instead, we should ask: Does assessment do what we want it to do in terms of promoting the kinds of learning that are desired for the longer term? If it doesn’t do this, then there is no point in moving to other questions.
Building the capacity of students to be effective assessors for themselves and others is the raison d’être of Assessment Futures. It provides ways of thinking about assessment activities within this new frame. This is not meant to imply that what we have been doing already is not useful and worthwhile, but that we need to see assessment through a new lens, and that the use of such a lens may lead us to making some alterations to what we do. Assessment Futures is not about new techniques or assessment methods, but about ensuring that what we do in assessment is always subordinated to the main goal of higher education, which is to develop educated citizens who can face the many challenges of a complex and changing society.
Assessment for learning in the longer term has four key conceptual features that are based on the following assumptions:
•    assessment must contribute positively to students’ learning, 
•    it needs to take a view of what is to be learned and how it is to be learned beyond the time scale of the current course unit, 
•    it must develop students' ability to make judgements about what constitutes good work, 
•    it must position students as active learners, and 
•    it  must engage students in the process of seeing themselves as people who will contribute to practice, whatever that practice might be.
These key conceptual features are:
1. Assessment should be sustainable
2. Assessment should develop informed judgement
3. Assessment should construct reflexive learners
4. Assessment needs to form the becoming practitioner

Why should we consider starting with practice as a key organiser for assessment? Practice is anchored in the professional world, not the world of educational institutions. This means that there are multiple views of practice that are available external to the educational enterprise. Practice focuses attention on work outside the artifacts of the course—there is a point of reference for decision-making beyond course-determined assessment criteria and the actions that take place have consequences beyond those of formal assessment requirements. These create possibilities for new approaches to assessment. In addition to this, judgements of those in a practice situation (professional or client) make a difference to those involved. That is, there are consequences beyond the learning of the student that frame and constrain actions. These provide a reality-check not available in an internally-referenced assessment context. These considerations raise the stakes, intensify the experience and embody the learner more thoroughly in situations that anticipate engagement as a full professional. As we see beyond our course into the world of professional practice, assessment becomes necessarily authentic: authenticity does not need to be contrived. To sum up, a ‘practice’ perspective helps us to focus on a number of issues for assessment tasks within the mainstream of university courses. These include:
1.    Locating assessment tasks in authentic contexts. These need not necessarily involve students being placed in external work settings, but involve the greater use of features of authentic contexts to frame assessment tasks. They could model or simulate key elements of authentic contexts. 
2.    Establishing holistic tasks rather than fragmented ones. The least authentic of assessment tasks are those taken in isolation and disembodied from the settings in which they are likely to occur. While tasks may need to be disaggregated for purposes of exposition and rehearsal of the separate elements, they need to be put back together again if students are to see knowledge as a whole.
3.    Focusing on the processes required for a task rather than the product or outcome per se. Processes and ways of approaching tasks can often be applied from one situation to another whereas the particularities of products may vary markedly. Involving students in ways of framing tasks in assessment is often neglected in conventional assessment.
4.    Learning from the task, not just demonstrating learning through the task. A key element of learning from assessment is the ability to identify cues from tasks themselves which indicate how they should be approached, the criteria to be used in judging performance and what constitutes successful completion.
5.    Having consciousness of the need for refining the judgements of students, not just the judgement of students by others. Learning in practice involves the ability to continuously learn from the tasks that are encountered. This requires progressive refinement of judgements by the learner which may be inhibited by the inappropriate deployment of the judgements of others when learners do not see themselves as active agents. 
6.    Involving others in assessment activities, away from an exclusive focus on the individual. Given that practice occurs in a social context, it is necessary that the skill of involving others is an intrinsic part of learning and assessment. Assessment with and for others needs far greater emphasis in courses. 
7.    Using standards appropriate to the task, not on comparisons with other students. While most educational institutions have long moved from inappropriate norm-referenced assessment regimes, residues from them still exist. The most common is the use of generic rather than task-specific standards and criteria that use statements of quality not connected to the task in hand (eg. abstract levels using terms such as adequate or superior performance, without a task-oriented anchor). 
8.    Moving away from an exclusive emphasis on independent assessment in each course unit towards development of assessment tasks throughout a program and linking activities from different courses. The greatest fragmentation often occurs through the separate treatment of individual course units for assessment purposes. Generic student attributes can only be achieved through coordination and integration of assessment tasks across units. Most of the skills of practice discussed here develop over time and need practice over longer periods than a semester and cannot be relegated to parts of an overall program. 
9.    Acknowledging student agency and initiation rather than have them always responding to the prompts of others. The design of assessment so that it always responds to the need to build student agency in learning and development is a fundamental challenge for assessment activities. This does not mean that students have to choose assessment tasks, but that they are constructed in ways that maximise active student involvement in them. 
10.    Building in an awareness of co-production of outcomes with others. Practitioners not only work with others, but they co-produce with them. This implies that there needs to be assessment tasks in which students co-construct outcomes. While this does not necessarily require group assessment as such, it needs to design activities with multi-participant outcomes into an overall regime.The challenge the practice perspective creates is to find ways of making some of these shifts in assessment activities in a higher education context that is moving rapidly in an outcomes-oriented direction, but which embodies the cultural practices of an era deeply sceptical of the excessively vocational. The implication of taking such a perspective is not that more resources are required or that we need to scrap what we are doing and start again. It does however require a profound change of perspective. We need to move from privileging our own academic content and of assessing students as if our part of the course was more important than anything else, to a position that is more respectful of the use of knowledge, of the program as a whole and the need to build the capacity of students to learn and assess for themselves once they are out of our hands. Some of the changes required are incremental and involve no more than altering existing assessment tasks by giving them stronger contextual features. However, others create a new agenda for assessment and provoke us to find potentially quite new assessment modes that involve making judgements in co-production of knowledge. If we are to pursue this agenda, we need to take up the challenges and operate in ways in which our graduates are being increasingly required to operate in the emerging kinds of work of the twenty first century."

[A] productive way of reframing assessment discourse is around the theme of informing judgement (cf. Hager and Butler, 1996). That is, informing the capacity to evaluate evidence, appraise situations and circumstances astutely, to draw sound conclusions and act in accordance with this analysis. This is an idea that focuses on learning centrally —learning to form judgements—but also on the act of forming judgements about learning—which may be used for validating purposes. This notion has the potential to incorporate a forward-looking dimension—informing judgement for future decision-making about learning. At one level this is what university courses have always been about and therefore it is not a substantial change. However, with regard to the discourse of assessment it marks a significant shift of focus away from the process of measuring effects and artefacts towards what education is intended to be for - that is, the formation of a capable person who can engage in professional work and contribute to society as an informed citizen.Informing judgement as the central idea of assessment has a multiple emphasis. It relates both to the judgement of others in processes of certification and aiding learning and to informing the judgment of the learner in processes of presenting themselves for certification processes and for learning in the short and long term. It encompasses the dual focus of summative and formative assessment. However, formatively, it is directed towards informing learners’ judgement as a key function of assessment as distinct from the present almost exclusive focus on informing others. It has the potential to orient assessment towards consequences in that it makes a desired consequence explicit: informing the judgement of learners. It acknowledges the importance of reflexivity and self-regulation through acknowledgement of the centrality of judgement as a process. And it has the potential to contextualise assessment in practice, as judgement always has to be for a particular purpose.Concerns about measurement, objectivity, standards and integrity are integral to a notion of informing judgement, but in themselves they are secondary to the act of becoming informed. It is this shift from foregrounding measurement to contextualising it as integral to processes of informing judgement we regard as important. It is not a matter of rejecting the concerns that are presently dominant, but viewing them within an appropriate educational frame that more adequately allows concerns about learning to come forward. A view of assessment that places informing judgement as central is able to include key graduate learning attributes as an intrinsic part of what assessment is for. It gives prominence to students making judgements about their own learning as a normal part of assessment activities, not as a special add-on that, unfortunately, student self-assessment has sometimes come to be.New ways of inscribing assessment cannot in themselves change assessment and assessment practice, however. A shift will only occur if there is sufficient desire to want to move from one form of discourse to another and if a possible alternative is sufficiently generative to enable other desires to be focused through it. 
What then needs to be taken into account in such a view of assessment? Strong connections between assessment activities and what students learn have been accepted for some time. Assessment activities signal what is to be learned, they influence the approaches to learning that students take and they can indicate the levels of achievement that are required for any given unit of study. In short, assessment frames what students do. It provides an indication of what the institution gives priority to in making judgements, it provides an agenda more persuasive than a syllabus or course outline and it therefore has a powerful backwash effect on all teaching and learning activities. In some settings it has a stronger instrumental effect than others, but it has an effect on learning in all of them. We simply have to imagine how different the experience of a course would be if all the formal assessment activities were removed or changed to become discretionary to begin to see the influence. While these effects of assessment influence learning, they do not constitute educational features. Our view is that assessment can have a crucial role to play in an educational framing of learning of all kinds and in all settings and that an excessive officially sanctioned focus on grading and classification has distracted attention from what this role can be. The features we intend the notion of informing judgement to address are threefold.The first feature connects assessment and learning directly. It takes up the [issue] of consequential validity and places the consequences of acts of assessment as central. Do assessment acts actively promote development of students’ capacity to make judgements about their own work throughout the course? Are there inadvertent effects of certification and grading on students learning that must be countered? Considerations of the consequential effects of assessment, the influences of assessment beyond the point of graduation, must also be taken into account. Are students better equipped to engage in learning in professional practice? Are they able to deploy assessment strategies to positively influence their own continuing learning? Are they able to utilise the resources of others in this process? Unless it is possible to claim that assessment within higher education contributes in a significant way to these goals, in principle and in practice, then it has an insufficient learning focus. The second feature of the desirable view of assessment we propose is a focus on fostering reflexivity and self-regulation. These represent two similar ideas, but come from different traditions—reflexivity from social theory (eg. Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992; Giddens, 1991) and self-regulation from psychology (Karoly, 1993). What they share is a view that a key to learning in complex settings is to be able to ‘look again’, to monitor one’s own performance, to see one’s own learning in the context in which it is deployed and to respond with awareness to the exigencies of the tasks in which one is engaged. Reflexivity and self-regulation are not just about skills, although there is obviously a skill element to them. They involve dispositions and an orientation to both work and learning. They also have an affective dimension. They involve confidence and an image of oneself as an active learner, not one solely directed by others. A focus on reflexivity and self-regulation is a key element in constructing active learners, as these features need to be constructed both by teachers and examiners and by themselves.There have been some assessment initiatives that operate in this general territory. The use of self- and peer-assessment practices as a formal part of a course of study is an example (e.g. Boud, 1995). However, not all self- and peer-assessment activities have a substantial impact on reflexivity and self-regulation, particularly those of a procedural kind, and reflexivity and self-regulation encompass more than is normally subsumed in self-assessment practices, at least as documented in much of the literature. Peer-assessment is sometimes used as a proxy for assessment by staff in the generation of grades and some conceptions of self-assessment are not even associated with the promotion of self-regulation (see Tan 2007). The seeking and utilising of feedback from multiple sources can be part of reflexivity and self-regulation, but if information from feedback is not used explicitly for learning to complete the feedback loop and to contribute to building an understanding of how to effectively utilise information from others, then it is very limited. Some aspects of self- and peer-assessment clearly have a part to play in a new conception of assessment for learning, but it is only part of the picture. Unless the fostering of reflexivity and self-regulation are part of the normal curriculum and are a fundamental part of course design, the impact of assessment on them is likely to be limited. The building of skills for reflexivity and self-regulation through assessment acts is not currently a strong feature of courses.The third feature of a new focus of assessment is recognition of the variety of contexts in which learning occurs and is utilised. Dominant views of assessment have arisen from traditions in which what is taught is also assessed. In this, assessment is an act of measuring what has been learned from a course. The context of assessment then is the course itself, typically within an academic program in an educational institution. Contexts of application in work or professional practice may be used for illustrative purposes, but their influence on assessment is secondary, they are effectively used for background colour. Application of what is learned typically takes place post-graduation, or at least post- the unit of study. It occurs after assessment and cannot therefore be fully part of it. This creates an issue, which is often referred to as the problem of transferability of learning. That is, application to any given context is postponed and treated as a separate stage of learning that is not the concern of the educational institution, (Boud, 2001: Bowden and Marton, 1998). The context of assessment in higher education is often taken to be the world of the course, not the world of practice, despite lip service being paid to the latter. The world of the course privileges individual judgments. Acts of assessment judge individuals. Subject content is reified. The role of peers in learning and the nature of practice are downplayed. And knowledge is separated from the world in which it is used (Hager, 2004). Of course, in professional programs this is often less marked than in programs in which there is no obvious site of application. Indeed, one of the most significant innovations in professional education, problem-based learning, makes a particular feature of assessing learning in the context of application to problems as authentically constructed as can be achieved within an educational institution (Nendaz and Tekian, 1999). Again, there are many examples of a partial engagement with the contexts in which knowledge is used, most notably in the increasing use of what is termed authentic assessment (Wiggins, 1989). This refers to assessment practices that are closely aligned with activities that take place in real work settings as distinct from what are the, often artificial, constructs of university courses. This move has progressed a very long way in some vocational education and training systems in which the only legitimate forms of assessment are those which are based upon performance in a real work setting outside the educational institution and judged by an expert practitioner (see Kvale 2007). While there are limitations to an authentic assessment approach taken to extremes, the notion that assessment tasks should acknowledge and engage with the ways in which knowledge and skills are used in authentic settings is a useful one.
Conclusion
What might be some of the issues that arise from this articulation and how might they be addressed? Using a new term does not in itself make a difference to practice. However, if the notion of informing judgement is accepted as the guiding principle in all aspects of assessment, it leads to a new set of questions that enable us to determine whether any given set of assessment practices is addressing the central question of improving judgements of both assessors and learners. Practices that may otherwise demonstrate qualities of reliability and validity, may not meet the requirement of informing judgement of learners.If the notion of informing judgement is taken up, the question arises of how assessment that exhibits this feature might differ from assessment that does not. As is implicit in the discussion given above, a discourse of informing judgement will always have the dual qualities of a focus on the learning needs of students as well as the legitimate needs of others to have an account of students’ learning outcomes. This points to an important shift of emphasis. If judgement is to be informed, what is the language that is to be used to do the informing? The current dominant discourse uses the language of marks and grades, as if there were a common understanding of how they might be interpreted. This language is one that destroys detail and obscures meaning. What information is conveyed in knowing that a person gained a ‘B’ or a Credit in a given unit of study? It only has meaning in the context of comparison with other students within the same context because it has its origins in a norm-referenced system of assessment that is becoming outmoded. Grades can be used in a standards-based system but only when grade descriptors are present. We suggest that if informing judgement is widely adopted, it will be necessary to move to a language of judgement that is both more transparent and more varied than the language of current assessment discourses. While there are still problems in the use of portfolios and qualitative descriptors of outcomes, and while further refinement of them is necessary, this may be worth undertaking, as the alternative has even less to offer.ReferencesBoud, D.

Students need to be actively engaged throughout assessment. Students full participation as active agents in assessment needs to be planned and carefully staged. They need to see the value of what they are doing and can persuade themselves of its importance to their learning.
The issue is not what the assessment method is, but rather what are the learning consequences of using it in a particular way.
This section aims to prompt consideration of some matters that might be overlooked in designing and redesigning assessment tasks. We will look at the following:
Checklists

Re-Engineering Assessment Practices in Scottish Higher Education"
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/designing-and-redesigning-assessments/considerations,"Students should have tasks in which they are active players in determining some key features. Being active involves an emotional and a cognitive engagement. The challenge for teaching and for the designing of tasks is to create situations that capture the interest and enthusiasm of students.
There is no such thing as a foolproof assessment strategy that will produce particular results. Assessment is inherently relational. It depends on the attitudes learners bring to it and how the student perceives both the assessment and the course.
When the assessment task is best undertaken, and the optimum time for students to receive comments on it, is an important decision. Too soon and students will not have had enough time to prepare, too late and students can’t make direct use of the feedback.
The key issue is exactly when do they need their work returned to make best use of comments. To contribute to longer term learning, students need comments when there is a realistic prospect of them doing something with them.
Assessment often occurs at the end of a module or semester. While this is appropriate for certifying final achievement, it is inadequate to support learning. Spreading assessment across a semester signals to students that engagement throughout the module is needed for successful completion and that study is not just about intensive work at the very end.
Authentic activities can be motivating, but students can take a 'surface' approach to the subject if the activities involve a significant increase in complexity and demands This can also occur with the introduction of new and unfamilar forms of assessment. Students need to be introduced to complex and different forms of assessment gently.
Students often adopt a surface or strategic approach to their learning when under pressure. While more time on task is a major contributor to learning, it can shift to overload. This should be carefully considered. It can occur inadvertently when there is little co-ordination between units students are enrolled in.
Set assessments in contexts which provide cues and clues about quality and consequences. A skill students need to develop is to look to the context and positioning of a task to determine what will be involved in completing it well.
For example, considerations such as:
Being competent judges of their own work and that of others is not an outcome that can be achieved easily or is ever complete. It is important that students are helped to build this capacity progressively by guiding them through simpler tasks to more demanding ones."

Visit the elements section to see how some of them have been applied in specific situations.
Designing an assessment task just to test some area of knowledge is too restricted a way to think about assessment. How students respond to a task depends on many considerations, only one of which is whether they have the appropriate subject knowledge. They may
This means that tasks have to be constructed and located not only to take account of the demands of the discipline knowledge involved, but the full context of the assessment activity. A task that is poorly completed in one situation can be excellent in another."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/designing-and-redesigning-assessments/assessment-process,"The effect of assessment is very sensitive to the local context - of the course and its place in the course, of the student and their prior experience and current expectations. This means that several iterations of any assessment practice are normally needed to realise the potential of the strategy adopted. Often small changes in proceedure or communication can have a major impact of how it is received. Time spent in helping establish student expectations can often be beneficial.
Because students responses to assessment tasks are influenced by what they bring and the context in which they operate, it is rare that even superior assessment tasks can be designed once and then left intact. Assessment tasks will usually need to be refined over the first two uses and refreshed later as courses change. Re-design is not a sign of failure, but a sign of diligence and commitment to assessment process."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/designing-and-redesigning-assessments/convincing-students,"New assessment practices need careful introduction, on multiple occasions, with opportunities for students to raise questions about them. The greater the departure from the status quo, the more effort is required in justification. Students need to be able persuade themselves that what they are doing is worthwhile even while they find it demanding.
Teachers also need to be able to explain why they are changing assessment, so they can explain the benefits and feel sure that their course/module structure reflects this change.
See Convincing staff
A persuasive rationale is vital in engaging students in any unfamilar assessment activities. Vague arguments about the future value of current activities are not compelling.
Many students have been successful with existing assessment and can feel threatened by what they may see as a change in the rules of the game."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/designing-and-redesigning-assessments/grading-and-exams,"Major differences exist between disciplines as to whether students will take on ungraded activities.
The greater the magnitude of a task required out of scheduled hours, the greater the likelihood that some students will not fully engage with it if they don’t see that it will “count”. Whether to “weight” any of the tasks discussed here is a local matter.
The argument needs to be made to students that ungraded tasks are substantial preparation for activities that do “count”. Ask yourself - if the task doesn’t prepare them, then why are you proposing that they do it? If the answer is that the formal assessment activities don't reflect what you consider important, then the priority is to reconsider the need for the activities.
Tests and exams can distort learning when they occur exclusively at the end of a module or semester, or are weighted heavily. Students need to be actively engaged in meaningful learning activities and assessment tasks (even if they are not graded) right from the start. If the weight of assessment is at the end, it acts as an encouragement to delay getting started.
Tests and exams don't often allow for student involvement, other than compliance. This does not position students as active learners who learn to assess themselves and others.
There are ways to use examinations for long-term learning. As powerful drives of student behaviour, exams need to accommodate this agenda. These include:
Tests, exams and assignments need to be consciously designed to assess the range of learning outcomes in a course and to foster learning in the longer term."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/designing-and-redesigning-assessments/convincing-staff-and-managers,"Significant effects can be achieved through modest revisions of existing assessment tasks that do not add to staff or student workload. eg. making a task more authentic in form, including discussions of what constitutes good work in an assignment, worked examples, etc.
While there may need to be an initial investment of time to understand new practices and ways of thinking about assessment, the implementation of these with students should certainly not increase staff workload. It should aim to make the work of staff in assessment become more meaningful and useful to student learning. It should also decrease time in repetitive tasks that add little value to learning, eg. in repetitive marking and in giving detailed comments on work at times when students have little use for them.
A great deal, as long as the groups are not deliberately large in order to reduce teaching resources to them. Even within this constraint, much can be done, but closer attention to detail and process is needed. It is important to treat large groups as collections of smaller entities in which tasks are undertaken, even if specific tutors are not designated to these.
The best use of staff time is in:
Avoid:
Some colleagues and academic managers have a very unsophisticated view of assessment that focusses on generating and justifying marks. In engaging with them it is important to keep in mind that marking schemes are a second order consideration. Unless the assessment activities are having a good influence on student learning, they should be changed before giving any consideration to marking. Having a good marking process is worthless if what is being graded does not focus students on what is most important."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/designing-and-redesigning-assessments/start-early,"Building a student's capacity to make judgements of their own work and that of others needs to be considered from the start. It should not be deferred to the latter stages of a course/module.
This does not mean that each of the approaches discussed on this site is useful at the start of a program. All tasks need to be tailored to the context and to students’ prior knowledge or skill.
In the first stages of a completely new topic, time needs to be spent on understanding new material before some of the reflexive approaches discussed can be effective.
Some students enter higher education without a commitment to being a learner. Teaching effort can often successfully encourage students to actively position themselves as learners who are expected to take responsibility for what they do (except for those who are really resistant).
Lecturers need to emphasise their unrelenting expectation that students will become learners and develop an an appreciation of all that this requires. This needs to occur in the earliest weeks of a program along with the staging of the tasks which will reinforce it. Student lack of engagement is a sign that they are not developing an identity as a learner and that steps need to be taken to involve them more in the course. There is a growing literature on student engagement that provides useful ideas for addressing this.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/designing-and-redesigning-assessments/issues-students-consider,"Students can be adversely affected by inappropriate comments on their work or remarks they judge to be harsh or unfair. The effect is greater when the person making comments is held in high esteem.
The issue is not just one of insensitive comments, but of the kind of vocabulary used. Care needs to be taken in the use of ‘final vocabulary’ -the use of words such as ‘good’, ‘right’, ‘rigorous’, ‘professional standards’.  These terms do not allow students to engage with them or allow for other possibilities. The negative or implied negative versions of these terms are even more damaging.
See Boud (1995)
Students like to have their work respected and valued even if it doesn’t meet the very highest standards. They have put considerable effort into it (even when it appears they have not), and they want to know that it has been given due consideration.
Giving comments which are timely, use respectful and informative language and take into account what students are expected to do with it should be given high priority.
When classes are large and have inadequate teaching resources, there are severe limits on how specific such comments can be. Assignment cover sheets with friendly introductions which identify particular issues to give attention to can be used, even when comments come from a standard item bank of remarks.

Rachel Power completed the Bachelor of Business with specialisations in Accounting and Economics.
""I really valued the opportunity to try out a range of different subjects before I chose a specialisation. This meant that I could consider how my major would relate to the broader business context. I wanted to be challenged to succeed and practically apply my studies to real life situations and I felt that this course would best help me achieve these goals. I have learned to make ethical decisions to work through conflicts in various business contexts.""

Sarah Siv completed the Bachelor of Business, Bachelor of Arts in International Studies, pairing a specialisation in Marketing with studies in France.
“I have been really impressed by the practical and flexible approach to learning that UTS embodies. The assignments we do in class reflect real life issues, and getting to try such a wide range of subjects in my first year has really helped me to work out where my skills and passion lie. Living in France [on exchange] for a year has been a profound, challenging and rewarding experience and has really given me a global perspective on my studies.”
Samantha Low completed the Bachelor of Business Bachelor of Laws combined degree.

Bianca Azzopardi completed the Bachelor of Business with majors in Human Resource Management and Business Law
After working as General Manager, The Sam Prince Group and where the was named Australian HR Manager of the year 2018, Bianca was recently appointed as CEO of Zambrero, the company with which she started as an intern.
“The Capstone subject in the Human Resource Management Major was nothing short of a life changing experience. I was able to put into practice not only the theories and practices I’d learnt within the subject but moreover the knowledge I had gained through the entirety of my degree. Upon completion, I was approached by the Human Resource Manager of Zambrero for an internship. This four week internship then resulted in a full-time position within the company.”
Daniel Favalaro studied in the Bachelor of Management (Honours) with a specialisation in Sport Business. He now works as Unit Manager - Sport, for Network Ten.
“UTS has a great Sport Business program, it’s definitely one of the leading universities in this field. The Sport subjects often focus on leading case studies to provide rich, real life examples of the content of study in action. This has been very useful in my experience and while it is always a big step up from uni to your first proper job, I feel that these lessons put us in good stead for future challenges and opportunities. I would highly recommend UTS, I’ve had a great experience here and I feel that it has really put me in good stead for the future, with a great grounding for my career.”
Roann Kettlewell specialised in Marketing in the Bachelor of Business. After four years in account management at PHD Worldwide, she is now the Marketing and Communications Manager for Kimberlin Education - a digital education agency.
“The skills that I had gained from the practical assignments throughout my degree and the strong foundation business knowledge that I had accumulated within my first year, such as accounting and finance, really gave me a step up and helped me stand out. I started my role as an account coordinator during the last session of my degree and the flexibility of the timetable at UTS helped me to fit my study around work. The broad range of subjects that I have completed throughout my degree has given me a bank of knowledge which I draw on every day at work. Thanks to my UTS Business degree I am now looking forward to a fulfilling career within the media advertising industry.”
Belinda Thomas completed the Bachelor of Management (Tourism) and is the Regional Marketing Manager - Asia, at Qantas.
“I transferred from another university after one session because the degree offered by UTS Business School really appealed to me. Unlike most tourism courses, the UTS course includes subjects like accounting and I was looking for something more substantial – something that would prepare me for a career in management but still let me flex my creative muscles.”
Lloyd Wood combined the Bachelor of Business with the Bachelor of Laws and now works as a lawyer in Banking and Infrastructure at Gilbert + Tobin.
“The beauty of Business at UTS is that it is so flexible and can be combined with most other degrees. I have found that doing a combined degree has equipped me with a range of cross industry skills, and allows me to gain a more rounded perspective of industry issues. The value of hard work is one of the most valuable things I have learnt in my time here, you really have to earn your Business degree at UTS, which makes it all the more rewarding, and I think industry professionals recognise that.”"

At UTS Business School, we encourage every student to explore the possibility of undertaking an internship or work integrated learning experience. We have a dedicated team responsible for providing students with career preparation training and support. Students can choose to complete an internship as part of a formal subject or as part of a voluntary internship. 
 
The business internship elective subject helps students gain relevant work experience and valuable industry insight while completing their degree. This subject provides undergraduate Business, Management and Economics students with an opportunity to develop and apply their academic knowledge and skills in the context of a real workplace. It will enhance the students’ employability by increasing their awareness of employers’ expectations of performance and conduct and building valuable work readiness skills, such as communication, collaboration, and reflective practice.
Students will develop their communication and collaboration skills through their workplace experience. Students will develop social responsibility by reflecting on business and personal decisions using principles of ethical decision making. The assessments complement and enhance the student learning journey and provide the student an opportunity to think about their future career and how to achieve these goals.
See 26600 Business Internship page for eligibility requirements, subject information and information on how to enrol. 
UTS Business School’s postgraduate business internship subjects help students gain relevant work experience and valuable industry insight while completing their studies. There are two subjects to choose from: 26799 Internship Experience (12cp capstone in Management programs) or 27769 Professional Internship for Graduates (6cp elective subject).
The Internship Experience subject is the culminating professional experience of a student’s postgraduate degree. It brings together the key features of a capstone subject and the ability to learn in a professional setting, including through the integration of theory and practice and the extension of prior learning; the use of authentic and contextualised experiences; challenging and complex problems; socialisation into professional roles; autonomous yet collaborative learning and development of professional agency; and through the application of critical inquiry and creativity.
See Postgraduate Internship Subjects for eligibility requirements, subject information and information on how to enrol.
 
The subject expands on students’ existing professional, business, technical and ethical decision-making skills. It allows them to foster and diversify their current career experience through a deeply integrated practice approach and through the development of professional networks and prospects. For those students who have limited work experience, this subject provides the opportunity, through a placement, to gain work integrated learning experience and to relate it to theoretical and applied learning.

Overwhelming feedback from past applicants and other participants in the process is that you should take time to prepare your application well. This means starting well before the due date for applications. Read the criteria thoroughly and make sure you address them in your application.
Senior academics have a range of views about the qualities of good applications. Here is some common advice from administration and members of previous committees. A good application:
Yes. Teaching is valued equally with research, and service to the university and community according to the UTS criteria. People have been promoted to all levels at UTS in part on a major or outstanding contribution to teaching. However, you do need to provide non-anecdotal evidence about the quality of your teaching.
Academic portfolios encourage you to collect and reflect on a wide range of evidence about your teaching and some questions on which you might reflect.
Teaching will be judged against a series of criteria. The UTS allow for teaching in different disciplines to demonstrate quality of teaching in different areas. Whatever area you are teaching in, you will need to provide non-anecdotal evidence of the quality."

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/scholarship-and-research/scholarship-learning-and-teaching,"Scholarly teaching at UTS includes exploring our own learning and teaching practice, as well as the current issues and debates in the literature and within disciplines. We then build upon these discussions to enhance teaching and to contribute to improved understanding of learning and teaching.
A useful explanation of scholarship and the advancement of knowledge and its applications at UTS can be found within the Academic Portfolio scholarship section."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/scholarship-and-research/scholarship-learning-and-teaching/reflection-teaching,"Reflection is a process of reviewing and thinking critically about our activities and the world around us. It goes beyond describing what we do, to challenging our assumptions and justifying changes. It is part of the process of researching our own teaching, and includes thinking about what teaching means to us, what our intentions are for teaching and learning, why we teach in particular ways or whether things have gone as intended and why. An important part of critical reflection is asking ourselves “why” questions about teaching and learning, considering possible reasons why we think a class, assignment etc went well, or didn’t, and considering alternatives for how and why we might do things differently. Thinking about why we do things, whether they have gone as intended, why we think they worked well or didn't and how we might do them differently next time? Recording these reflective thoughts can help us to crystallise our understanding of experiences, make connections between different aspects of our work and identify possible improvements. Recording personal reflections has the added benefit of documenting learning over time through recognising the changing nature of your reflections.
Critical reflection involves reviewing our activities and constantly testing the assumptions and actions related to our work. Brookfield (1995) describes reflective teaching in the following way:
""Critically reflective teaching happens when we identify and scrutinise the assumptions that undergird how we work. The most effective way to become aware of these assumptions is to view our practice from different perspectives. Seeing how we think and work through different lenses is the core process of reflective practice"".(Brookfield 1995, p.xii-xiii)
In the case of teaching, the different 'lenses' that Brookfield refers to include that of your own prior experiences; along with looking from the different perspectives of the students, colleagues, and from reading the literature. Reflecting on the evidence that you collect from a range of different sources is an important part of scholarly learning and teaching.
Reflective writing is different from the descriptive writing used in diaries, records of meetings or casual notes about what seemed to work well or didn’t in a class session. Kember, McKay, Sinclair & Wong (2008) provide one useful way of recognising different types of writing. They describe four levels of reflection:
Critical reflection involves stepping back from events, exploring alternative explanations and challenging assumptions. By making more connections with a range of perspectives from the literature and other sources, and reflecting back on your earlier reflections and challenging your earlier assumptions you will gain valuable new insights about your teaching.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/scholarship-and-research/scholarship-learning-and-teaching/peer-review-teaching,"The peer review of teaching with colleagues has been a longstanding practice of many UTS academics across the university. Peer review of teaching can be seen as a collaborative and formative process that informs and inspires teaching practices and development. It is also a scholarly process that can provide compelling evidence for other summative purposes, for example, applying for a teaching award or for promotion.
An Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) project about peer review of teaching in blended learning environments (the way most courses are taught at UTS) was led by Associate Professor Jo McKenzie from 2008-2010, in collaboration with a project team and participating academics from across the ATN universities. This two-year project developed a very useful framework and set of criteria that can be used for all types of peer review. Various resources for the scholarly peer review of teaching in fully-online, blended or face to face learning environments are also available."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/scholarship-and-research/scholarship-learning-and-teaching/developing-academic-portfolio,"A portfolio supports you in your role as an academic by creating a record of your reflection, development and achievements over time. You may like to use aspects of your portfolio to provide evidence for formal probation review, progression or promotion processes.  
An Academic Portfolio is an organised record of your academic experiences, achievements and professional development. It consists of a collection of documents which illustrate the variety and quality of work that you do, along with your reflections on these documents and on your development over time. 
There are three major areas of academic work that you should include in your portfolio:
You should include some evidence of your participation and reflection in each of these areas, although at any point in your academic career your work is likely to have a greater focus on some areas than on others. If your appointment is at level B (lecturer) or higher, you would consider a fourth aspect, that of leadership within the university. As well as including these areas of academic work, try to include an overview section where you reflect on and review your activities in relation to your overall goals and career plans.
These guidelines suggest ways that you can develop your Portfolio to encompass the major areas of academic practice. Each academic's experience and context will be different, so there is no expectation that all Portfolios will be similar. Rather they should contain evidence of individual academic achievements and experiences, with reflections on these experiences.
Developing a portfolio is an ongoing process. As your portfolio develops over time, you will include documents which provide evidence of a wide range of activities and achievements, along with your reflections on these documents. Getting started means beginning to create a framework and sections for your portfolio which you find useful and can continue to use, then adding one or two items at a time as you engage with different aspects of your work. 
Try to add to your documents and reflections on a regular basis, both to assist your professional development and so that your portfolio will be up to date for occasions when you discuss your academic progress with your supervisor or are planning an application for promotion.
Academic leadership
It is quite reasonable to keep some aspects of the academic portfolio private. There are likely to be some reflections or documents which are important for your development but which you do not wish to show to others.
A well developed academic portfolio would be too much to present for either your discussions with your academic supervisor or for a promotion committee. It would be more appropriate to include an extract with descriptions of and reflections on your major achievements and references to other documentation.
The following guidelines provide advice on developing different sections of your portfolio. For each of the three major areas of academic work (teaching and educational development, scholarship and the advancement of knowledge and its applications, contributions to the university and the community) we have included some advice on:
The ideas described are suggestions. Your portfolio will be individual and is likely to have more emphasis in some areas than in others. Remember that an effective portfolio will include both documentary evidence and reflection, eg. a subject outline that you have developed with a reflection on the effectiveness of the outline in terms of student learning and the changes you may make as a result.
Many academics, especially those at Associate Lecturer and Lecturer level, spend a great deal of time preparing for teaching, teaching and assessing their students' learning. We hope that developing this section of the portfolio will enable you to improve your practice as a teacher through reflection and self evaluation.
Imagine that you are trying to give someone else a picture of your teaching - what you do and why you do it that way. Your portfolio should create a picture that illustrates some of the complexity and variety of what you do and why. At minimum, your portfolio would include a statement outlining your own teaching philosophy, and an overview of your teaching experience: the range of subjects and classes you have taught, postgraduate supervision etc. It would then include some items documenting different aspects of your teaching.
Describe your own understanding of teaching and the way in which you see the relationship between teaching and learning. In this way you will have a record of your thoughts on teaching and learning as you commence your career as an academic at UTS. You will be able to return to your initial ideas from time to time and consider the development and changes that have occurred as you have developed your expertise. This section could be private to begin with, but later you might develop a description of your teaching philosophy to include in the portfolio extract that you would show to others.
Examples that could be used to support or give evidence for your teaching over time may include:
Scholarship can be defined in several ways according to your academic context. In UTS documentation such as promotion guidelines, 'scholarship' is described as the distillation and integration of knowledge. Scholarship of this type would be expected in most areas of academic work, including teaching, research, consultancy and many types of service to the community. In reflecting on scholarship, you are encouraged to think about how you keep up to date in your field and continue to distil and integrate knowledge, both in your research and in your teaching, both in terms of content and process.
'Advancement of knowledge' includes activities which might commonly be referred to as research. The Academic Portfolio could be used to enable you to reflect upon the nature of research in your discipline, the research process and how you see yourself as a researcher. It could enable you to reflect upon your own development as a scholar and/or researcher and provide evidence of research development and contribution.
At the beginning of this section it might be useful to describe how you see scholarship in your discipline. Describe what it means to distil and integrate knowledge in your discipline area, what sources of knowledge are important and how you engage in scholarship in the different parts of your work, including your teaching.
Now describe what 'advancement of knowledge' or research means in your discipline, and how this relates to your own research interests and your development as a researcher. In some disciplines (eg the physical sciences) describing what research means might be fairly straightforward, in others (eg design or production studies) it might be more difficult to define and include aspects such as original creative contributions. It might be helpful to talk to one or two senior colleagues about the nature of research in your field and then reflect on their ideas.
The university expects all academics to make ongoing contributions to the university and to the role of the university in the community, at a level appropriate for their level of appointment. Activities which constitute a minimum contribution to the university will generally be part of your normal duties. This would involve reliable performance of your administrative responsibilities, contributions to policy development at a level appropriate for your level of appointment and for some academics the initiation or maintenance of links between the University and external groups (see promotions policies).
The nature of other contributions to the university and the community can vary markedly between individual academics according to their interests, abilities, discipline area, opportunities and level of appointment. Contributions to the university from level A or B academics could include active participation in Faculty or university committees or working parties, organisation or management of particular functions or events in your Faculty or taking on a role such as Academic Liaison Officer. Contributions to the community could include: involvement in professional societies or community groups relevant to your discipline area; organisation of public events, exhibitions, forums or meetings; membership of policy advisory or expert groups.
Some opportunities to contribute occur fortuitously but others may need to be planned for, initiated or deliberately sought. This is an area where your supervisor should be able to assist you, for example, by suggesting activities appropriate to your expertise and interests, suggesting your name for membership of committees or by referring you to colleagues or contacts within the university or elsewhere.
Include a statement about the nature of your contributions to the university and the community.
It could be helpful to describe the contributions which are expected of you in your academic unit, and outline your understanding of the kinds of contributions which are most commonly made in your discipline area. Then describe the expertise and interests that you have which might be most relevant to making further scholarly contributions to the university and community.
Academics at levels A and B are not usually required to perform leadership roles, however you may have opportunities to demonstrate leadership potential, for example by taking a leading role in a teaching development or research initiative. Promotion to Senior Lecturer requires that the applicant provide indications of a capacity for academic leadership within the university and promotion to Associate Professor requires that the applicant demonstrate leadership capacity. It would be wise to give some thought to the development of your leadership skills and qualities, and to document activities where you believe you have demonstrated a capacity for leadership.
It may be helpful to consider how the activities above fit with your personal goals and plans, or what kind of pattern they show when looked at together.
This final section of the portfolio could be private, but you might want to share aspects of it in discussion with your supervisor or mentor. Although the promotion, tenure and probation planning processes include consideration of broad goals, there are some other issues that could be very important to assist you to develop an on going plan for the future.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/scholarship-and-research/scholarship-learning-and-teaching/projects-and-resources/peer-review-resources,"Peer review of teaching can be used for a range of different purposes. The resources on this site have been designed to support different types of peer review.
An effective peer review process involves several stages: preparation prior to the review, pre-review briefing, review, debriefing and reporting and post-review action. These stages can be simplified or expanded for different types of review, but are useful in all reviews
Preparation before the review can enable the reviewee to gain more from the process. Preparation should include:
 
Here are our top ten choices – five books and five papers which are useful for Peer Review of any type. (Please let us know if you have others you think should be here).
Glassick, C.E., Huber, M.T. & Maeroff, G.I., A Special Report on Faculty Evaluation, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, US.
This book has been a key resource for the scholarship of teaching and learning since it was published following the influential ‘Scholarship Reconsidered’, which outlined four realms of scholarship - including the scholarship of teaching. Glassick and colleagues argue that in order to accord teaching the same recognition and rewards as research six standards should be applied: clear goals; adequate preparation; appropriate methods; significant results; effective presentation and reflective critique. Because these qualities of scholarly work are helpful in communicating standards to both reviewers and academics being reviewed (in any type of scholarly activity), they have been used as the basis of the framework developed in this project. There are numerous links to these widely used standards to be found in the literature (see Literature Review), highlighting their value for scholarly peer review in a wide variety of contexts.
Bernstein, D.J., Burnett, A.N., Goodburn, A. & Savory, P. Anker Bolton, MA, US.
This book has been written based on a four-year project that started in 1994 by University of Nebraska Peer Review of Teaching Project team members as a pragmatic guide to implementing peer review using ‘course portfolios’. Their ‘course portfolios’ (either benchmarking or developmental) emphasise teachers investigating, reflecting and systematically working through a defined process to “make visible the intellectual work of teaching”, and what has been documented available to others for online review. Although our project had a different focus (on the process of reviewing with a peer to clarify intentions for teaching, how these worked, reflecting ‘together’) this book along with resources on the website provide an important scholarly resource for reviewing in online environments, as well as many well documented examples and a repository of course portfolios.
Van Note Chism, N. & Chism, G.W. 2nd edn, Anker Pub. Co., Bolton, Mass, US.
The new edition of this popular book argues strongly for the need to expand the use of peer review, clearly outlining its potential for the improvement of teaching, as well as for recognising and rewarding good teaching. With chapters on different aspects of peer review, it draws on Chism’s experience and expertise to provide a wealth of useful examples from across the US. Some consideration is given to peer reviews in specialised contexts, such as laboratories, studios, and online in this edition and a variety of tools for peer review are provided, including many forms that could be adapted to local contexts.

This popular handbook developed by an Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) funded project provides a useful scoping resource for those wanting to gain an overview of the peer review ‘landscape’ in Australia. It identifies important considerations for implementation of peer review in programs and institutions, drawing on a national survey of peer review of teaching activities in Australian higher education. The framework developed for peer reviews in this instance sets out principles, potential benefits and required conditions for the successful implementation of peer review within programs. The core aspects of teaching utilised for the ALTC Awards for University Teaching have been suggested in the handbook as a basis for creating criteria for peer reviews. Several useful Australian case studies developed as part of the study are also described.
Bell, M., Higher Education Research and Development Society of Australasia Inc. (HERDSA)
This Green Guide from the Higher Education Research and Development Society of Australasia is an authoritative and concise guide to collaborative peer observation, based on the long-term work of Maureen Bell in this field. Although this guide does not specifically address peer review in online and blended environments, the best practices described make it particularly useful for those exploring teaching in face to face contexts. It provides a clear outline of useful theoretical frameworks and the process of peer observation, including observation techniques and several templates, for individuals and teams introducing peer review into their practice. The emphasis is on the value of partnerships and purposeful conversations for enhancing teaching the guide is a good resource for those supporting or conducting reviews.
Swinglehurst, D., Russell, J., & Greenhalgh, T., Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 24 ( 4), 383-393.
This article specifically considers peer review in online contexts and builds on Swinglehurst’s previous research in this area. The action research project described mapped experiences of peer review and identified the particular opportunities and challenges of online learning environments, as well as the critical differences between peer observation in a face-to-face environment and online learning and teaching. Notable amongst these are both the record and the nature of the online interactions taking place. The authors have developed and implemented a successful peer review process (Peer-to-peer Reflection On Pedagogical Practice) based on their research. They importantly identify the critical success factors for peer review in online contexts. These include: a focus on collaborative reflection (social practice); discussion; flexibility and reflection to enable links to be made between teaching and research. The success of their programme underlines the value of peer review for the empowerment of teachers and the need to ensure ‘sanctioned’ time for academics to be able to consider what counts as good teaching and learning. Drawing on examples, suggestions are provided for quality enhancement ‘portfolios’ (rather than quality assurance) that could provide useful evidence to demonstrate the value of peer review for staff teaching and learning development for institutional purposes.
Bennett, S., & Barp, D. Teaching in Higher Education, 13 (5), 559-570.
In this important article focusing on blended learning environments the authors argue that the increasing role of online learning and quality assurance means professional development for teachers in these environments needs to be addressed. They emphasise that the nature of online and blended environments requires careful reconsideration of many aspects of peer observation (the term used for peer review). Pointing out that exactly what is 'observed' and reviewed, the structure of the review process and expectations of participants are some of the complexities to consider when teaching and learning activities are occurring across online and offline ’sites’. They found that this changes the scope of reviews. The fact that teachers and students are repositioned online, in terms of both time and place creates challenges. At the same time electronic records of learning offer exciting new potential for reviewing prior interactions and ongoing engagements. Therefore, ‘online-ness’ affects what you can ‘see’, how easy it is to understand what is going on, and potentially presents ‘more’ to observe. This may also increase the reviewer’s expectations about what they should consider and become overwhelming. This article emphasises that this still developing field of enquiry much is to still to be explored about exactly how being online changes the peer review process and benefits.
Bennett, S., & Santy, J. Nurse Education in Practice, 9(6), 403-406.
In this follow up article from Shirley Bennett the challenges and possibilities arising from the flexibility of online learning, particularly in terms of time and place are discussed. Using a case study from health practical examples of the authors’ own reciprocal reviews and discussions are provided to demonstrate both the process and outcomes of sharing ‘the new experience of online peer observation’. In electronic environments the reciprocity of peer review is emphasised as particularly valuable, providing much appreciated ‘mutual support’ for online teachers in what can be a very lonely process. The authors point out that such collaboration is invaluable not just for novice online teachers but equally for innovators, offering a ‘window’ into the teaching practice of other early adopting teachers.
Gosling, D. & O'Connor, K.M. (eds), SEDA Paper 124, Staff & Educational Development Association, London, UK. 
This SEDA Paper is a valuable update of Goslings established and widely cited work on peer observation (including his Higher Education Academy’s ESCalate project and guidelines (seehttp://escalate.ac.uk/resources/peerobservation/ opens an external site). This update recognises the need to move towards a more flexible ‘collaborative model’ of peer-supported review to facilitate the exploration of a full range of learning and teaching issues: including ‘e-learning’. Differentiation of what he has called the managerial (or evaluative), developmental and peer review models is built upon to emphasise the need to go beyond observing a single “teaching occasion” so that all of the elements that make up ‘teaching’ can be considered and valued. Based around six case studies that outline peer review implementation in different UK university contexts, the volume also has a useful introductory overview chapter where ten guiding principles that are illustrated in these case studies. Each case provides evidence of practice and summaries of ‘lessons learnt’ about what might best work in various contexts. The benefits of providing a flexible framework to enable scholarly, productive and legitimised peer review process are emphasised as a way to reduce the constraints of traditional peer observation sessions and broaden the scope of reviews. The use of peer review for development, discussion and dissemination of ‘best practice’ is also discussed making this publication a useful resource for academic development staff, as well as academics.
Bell, A., Mladenovic, R. & Segara, R. Teaching in Higher Education, 15 (1), 57–70
This article provides an interesting Australian example of peer observation being implemented specifically for tutor reflection and development. It draws on the work of Bell (2005) and an earlier project (Bell & Mladenovic, 2008) that described a peer observation process of collegial partnerships between tutors implemented in 2005 in a Faculty of Economics and Business. The value of peer observation is well accepted for supporting reflection on teaching, and here the benefits are linked with different types of self-reflection by tutors. The rarely mentioned importance of the affective dimensions of peer observation, and of sharing the process and outcomes of one’s teaching work with peers (both positive and negative) are also discussed.

A°kerlind, G. 2004, A new dimension to understanding university teaching, Teaching in Higher Education, Vol. 9, No. 3, July 2004.
Paper Abstract: This paper reports the outcomes of a study, undertaken from a phenomenographic perspective, of academics’ ways of experiencing or understanding being a university teacher. A range of understandings was found, representing in particular a varying focus on the experience of teaching as a: teacher transmission focused experience; teacher–student relations focused experience; student engagement focused experience; and student learning focused experience. This work builds on previous studies of university teachers’ conceptions of teaching. However, the focus taken in this study on the experience of being a teacher, rather than engaging in teaching, has highlighted new aspects of university teaching.
A°kerlind, G. 2008, A phenomenographic approach to developing academics’ understanding of the nature of teaching and learning, Teaching in Higher Education, Vol. 13, No. 6, December 2008, 633-644.
Paper Abstract: Phenomenography is best known as an empirical research approach for investigating variation in conceptions of different educational phenomena: including learning, teaching and particular disciplinary concepts such as price in economics and motion in physics. It is less well-known for its theoretical basis, in terms of its epistemological and ontological claims (Marton and Booth 1997), and the variation theory of learning that has developed out of phenomenographic research and theory (Marton and Tsui 2004). This paper discusses what ‘conception’ and ‘conceptual development’ mean from a phenomenographic perspective and how phenomenography and variation theory can be combined with empirical research on academics’ conceptions of teaching to inform the design of a postgraduate course for academics, aimed at the development of academics’ understanding of the nature of teaching and learning. Keywords: phenomenography; variation theory; conceptions of teaching; academic development; teaching development.

https://www.uts.edu.au/signature-events/keynote-speakers,"The aim of this keynote will be to explore some 'shoe-pinching' challenges in developing assessment practices in higher education fit for 21st-century purposes. Addressing these challenges will entail significant shifts of emphasis away from, for example, students as lone student assessees; from fixed-time/fixed-place/fixed-question assessments; from an almost exclusive focus on assignments as 'finished' products; from passive after-the-fact feedback; from communication as writing for the tutor-as-reader; from highly stipulative, closed-choice assessments; and from set-standard assessments based on teacher-defined learning outcomes. These shifts of emphasis will be challenging not just because they call for new assessment designs but because they also throw down the gauntlet to some long-cherished assumptions about what counts as high-quality, rigorous assessment.

Assessment is a powerful influence on learning. Assessment tasks shape what students regard as important, how they study and what they learn. They equip students with the knowledge, skills and dispositions they carry with them after graduation. How can assessment be designed and organized to have a positive influence on learning beyond the time frame of the course? How can we avoid inadvertently limiting actual study to those things that are least important in the longer-term? What is most important to build in to assessment tasks and how they are situated to ensure they have a useful influence?

The challenges of increasing student diversity in higher education require us to critically examine the assumptions that inform our assessment practices with commencing students. This session will report the findings of an Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) funded study of assessment practices with commencing students from a range of disciplines. The 'first-year assessment system' is investigated from the perspectives of both commencing students and academic and professional staff. The dimensions that commencing students use to appraise or make sense of assessment tasks are identified and their influence on engagement and learning explored. Similarly, academic staff conceptions of the purposes of early assessment and their perceived role in managing and motivating students' engagement with assessment are clarified. Findings are conceptualised in terms of a framework for enabling students through the assessment process.

This workshop is an introduction to some key considerations for facilitating successful student learning in tutorials. We will be discussing some of the fundamental things that can help students and teachers get the most out of these sessions, including: the purpose of tutorials; planning and running good tutorials; dealing with common issues; and how to build on your experiences.
In this workshop you will be exposed to international students' perspectives on studying at UTS, and have the opportunity to develop strategies applicable to your own teaching in tutorials or other small group contexts. During the workshop examples of successful inclusive teaching and learning strategies will be presented, including approaches to groupwork. You will then work in groups yourselves to develop and share strategies that are applicable to your teaching contexts.
This workshop demonstrates how to incorporate greater student activity into tutorials. It shows how to engage students in the learning process through problem solving, case studies, role-plays, games and simulations. Workshop participants will discuss the benefits to using such activities and how to overcome student resistance to taking a more active role in their learning.
In this workshop we will analyse examples of online learning activities that have been designed to support student learning and engagement. We will explore activities which feature selected aspects of UTSOnline (such as wikis, blogs, podcasts and online assessment) and consider how these could be used and improved to create more effective learning experiences for your students. To help you consider developing similar activities, we will also take a brief look at ways to more efficiently handle the administrative load in blended and online subjects. This workshop will have some hand-on activities and time for questions and discussions.
This workshop covers a range of strategies that can be implemented in tutorials to improve student writing. These include: building writing into teaching and tutorial activity; explicit scaffolding of assessment task requirements; providing material to assist students through guided writing processes in class or online; and directing the marking focus of teachers (macro and micro level language) to alert students to areas of concern.
The marking of student work and the provision of feedback can be a tedious and unrewarding task for many teachers. By understanding and applying the principles of good assessment practice, this important part of teaching can be made more effective and engaging for the student and the teacher. A range of technologies for supporting assessment will be also be demonstrated in this workshop, including UTSOnline, Turnitin, ReView and SPARK.
This workshop is designed to provide casual academic staff with the opportunity to examine their own experiences of lecturing. During the workshop participants will explore current models of student learning and focus on developing strategies for incorporating collaborative lecture-based activities that help students gain a deeper understanding of the material. The workshop will examine ways of explaining, increasing active participation and questioning techniques in large groups.
In this workshop participants will learn how UTSOnline is supported at UTS, and the processes required to create a UTSOnline subject, enrol students into the subject, and, activate and use, their Student View Account. Participants will also have the opportunity to create class announcements and upload course materials, as well as exploring the discussion board.
In the laboratory the staff : student ratio is approximately 1:15 and it may be the only teaching / learning activity in a large enrolment subject with such a favourable ratio. What are our expectations of the laboratory session? What do the students hope to get out of lab work? How can we prepare them to be ready to learn in the laboratory? How can we best prepare to make the laboratory session the best teaching / learning experience of the week? Thinking about optimising the experience for all concerned will make the laboratory session a rewarding experience for the students and, importantly, the teacher.

A current and recent institutional learning and teaching plan or strategy that is publicly available on the University's website.
The learning and teaching plan or strategy that describes the University's philosophy on and commitment to learning and teaching.
The 2006-2009 strategic plan links the teaching and research objectives of the university under three common themes which reflect the overall philosophy and mission of the university. The move away from developing a separate key strategic plan for teaching and learning represents a conscious desire to increase the integration of practice-oriented approaches to teaching and applied and socially-oriented approaches to research, consistent with the university's mission.
The teaching and learning objectives of the plan are also available.
Evidence of systematic support for professional development in learning and teaching for sessional and full-time academic staff.
The documentation must be publicly available on the University's website.
i. Academic Staff Agreement includes the following clauses:
The Guidelines elaborate further on the University's arrangements for review and development of academic staff. These clauses together with the guidelines create the policy framework for academic development programs.
UTS has a formal development program for new academics appointed at levels A and B and offers a Graduate Certificate in Higher Education Teaching and Learning which is available to all academic staff with module participation available to casuals.
Further teaching and learning development activities are provided at Faculty level by negotiation between the Faculty and the Institute for Interactive Media and Learning. 
An orientation session for new academic staff is run at the beginning of each semester.
Evidence of probation and promotion practices and policies which include effectiveness as a teacher.
Academic probation and promotions policies, identifying the areas which require academic staff members to provide evidence of their effectiveness as teachers when being considered in relation to promotion and probation (e.g. student evaluations, portfolios etc).
If the university does not have such policies, other acceptable evidence might include:
The University's Academic Staff Agreement (Clause 33) and the Guidelines (6.25 of HR Manual) set out the process and criteria for probation. The clause includes specific requirements in relation to the provision of evidence of teaching performance through student evaluation of teaching (sub-clause 33.6.4). Clause 36 of the Agreement also sets out arrangements for teaching evaluation during probation (sub-clauses 36.2 and 36.5).
The Record of Activities form is used to document activities undertaken during probation and provide evidence of achievement.
Academic staff at levels A and B are required to undertake a development program (Clause 32) which includes evaluating their teaching and developing an academic portfolio containing evidence of their performance and reflection on the evidence.
Promotion to levels C, D and E require academics to address criteria on teaching and educational development as one of the three categories under Performance and Standing. Promotion to level B (has been replaced by a Progression process) required the addressing of criteria on teaching.
Refer to:
The Academic Staff Agreement and Progression Guidelines and Procedures set out the processes and criteria for progression for level A to B. As part of their case to progress to level B staff will demonstrate skill in, and commitment to, teaching. The Guidelines state that applications for progression must include teaching evaluations over the last two years across the full portfolio of the applicant's subjects and list examples of other forms of evidence of effectiveness as a teacher.
Evidence of systematic student evaluation of teaching and subjects that informs probation and promotion decisions for academic positions.
The documentation must be publicly available on the University's website.
Policies on academic probation and promotion, identifying areas which specify that probation and promotion decisions are informed by student evaluation of teaching and subjects.
Sub-clause 36.2 states that teaching evaluations are a source of evidence of teaching performance that inform decisions on probation and performance.
Sub-clause 36.5 identifies requirements in relation to participation in teaching evaluation, including specific provisions for staff on probation.
The University's Academic Staff Agreement (Clause 33) and the Guidelines (6.25 of HR Manual) set out the process and criteria for probation. The clause includes specific requirements in relation to the provision of evidence of teaching performance through student evaluation of teaching (sub-clause 33.6.4). The Guidelines reinforce the statements in the Clause about teaching evaluation.
Guidelines include the advice that staff should provide the Promotions Committee with a summary of teaching evaluations over the last two years from a cross section of the applicant's full teaching portfolio.
The Academic Staff Agreement and Progression Guidelines and Procedures set out the processes and criteria for progression for level A to B. The Guidelines state that applications for progression must include teaching evaluations over the last two years across the full portfolio of the applicant's subjects.
The Student Feedback Survey (SFS) includes both items on subject and teaching quality and are used to evaluate teaching by students.
Evidence that student evaluations of subjects are publicly available on the University's website. The most recent results of student evaluations of subjects.
These data should be aggregated. A suggested level of aggregation is the DEST field of education (4 digit level). However, if universities have data that is aggregated at a level such as School or Faculty, this will be acceptable.
UTS data are aggregated at Faculty level to facilitate review and improvement actions in Faculties.
The subject and teaching feedback surveys have now combined into the Student Feedback Survey (SFS). The SFS is implemented under the guidance of the Student Feedback Survey Vice Chancellor's Operational Directive, Academic Staff Agreement and Faculty policies.
Consultations are currently in progress with Faculties and the Student Feedback Survey Vice Chancellor's Operational Directive is also being revised to reflect the changes in the new Academic Staff Agreement. A revised directive is expected to be finalised by end September 2006.

When lifting:
From time to time, the University practices building evacuation procedures. The signal for evacuation is a siren over the public address system, followed by instructions. Do not expect to be told the reason for the evacuation order. Occupants are usually told to leave the building via the fire stairs. Evacuations should be supervised by the Fire Warden for each floor, however, the member of staff who takes on this voluntary duty may not be present. Therefore, when the signal for an evacuation comes, each person has two responsibilities:
Where circumstances dictate that a building should be evacuated by ALL occupants, the following procedures will be adopted.
The film and television industry has had a number of very serious accidents over the past decade, some of them resulting in serious injuries and fatalities. Because of this, the industry has established a national safety protocol regarding safety during every production. This involves the writing of a Safety Report for any production script which contains any shots which might be considered hazardous to crew or actors or put people and property at risk in any way. The current ""Film Industry Recommended Safety Code"" suggests, and now demands, that a Safety Report is required for any production containing any sequences that involve:
Although UTS does not suggest that you do not use any of the above, the University strongly advises that should any scenes containing any of the above appear in a script, these scenes must be discussed fully with your lecturer before proceeding with the production. If your production does contain any of the above and you do decide to proceed without discussion with your lecturer, and then should anything go wrong, it could result in litigation that will not be covered by the University in any of its insurance coverage for student activities or normal liabilities.

Dr David Waller: Marketing is such a big area, and it's also just a nice specific area in business. It's the satisfying of needs and wants through the exchange process, and it's about understanding what the consumers want, so you can satisfy those needs.
Jessica Wong: I chose to study marketing because I really like the idea of working on a project with a team, and also working on it for a few months and then seeing the project come to life. For example, seeing people attending your event or seeing people being really engaged with your campaign. I really find that quite rewarding.
Dr Christine Eckert: Students learn all the skills that they need in order to be great marketing managers later in their real-world life.
Callie Leahy: As the marketing manager at Rode, it's all encompassing and it touches on a lot of base points across the business. It's new product development, into packaging, into the digital advertising, into print advertising and it keeps going.
Dr David Waller: UTS helps students develop an understanding about marketing and business in general by being practical, by relating what they're doing to what's happening in industry.
Callie Leahy: I wanted to pursue a post-graduate qualification in marketing because I do want to change career course, and I felt this added credibility. Some skills I learned at UTS range anything from networking to time management to priorities, and these are real-life challenges that you'll have in the workplace.
Dr Christine Eckert: My students do some group assignments where they are working on projects where they actually apply their skills, so that they have both sides of the story, the theoretical as well as the practical.
Jessica Wong: I definitely recommend studying marketing at UTS. All the projects that I've worked on I've gained skills and knowledge that I'd be able to apply in the workplace and a lot of the teachers and their lectures, and students have been really, really friendly, and I have found them to be really helpful throughout my degree.
Dr David Waller: Marketing is important because it is really the face of the business. A lot of people, they don't know the company, don't know the brand, don't know the product, will see some sort of marketing, an advertisement, a poster, word of mouth about it, and so it's really important to get it right.
Jessica Wong: We have a special skill to find a way to target a specific market and speak to a specific audience and that's why marketing is important."

Managing is not simply about making something efficient, getting organised to make it more productive. At UTS, we see managing as part of an essential role in earning public trust in providing what's needed in the public good. And that's a completely different take on the conventional ways of thinking about management.
At its core, management is about strategising and leading people and organisations to achieve business-critical goals — but at UTS, it’s so much more. You’ll gain fundamental skills in management and marketing, emerging as a strategic and critical thinker with the skills to influence others.

https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-business-school/research/hub-sustainable-enterprise,"The heightening impacts of social and ecological crises make sustainability an increasingly urgent imperative for business, requiring a fundamental rethink in how we organise and conduct business and economic activities. 
Our work at the UTS Business School situates business activities as being dependent on and interrelated with the Earth system and communities. We acknowledge the work of leading scientists who have identified the planetary conditions within which humans need to operate to thrive for generations to come. 
For over a decade an international team of scientists has been working on a suite of key indicators showing the dramatic acceleration of human impacts on the Earth system through the last two centuries.
Their work provides sobering evidence that, in the words of Oxford University geographer Professor Andrew Barry, humankind's “impacts are now connected, and systemic”.
 
 
The UTS Business School Hub for Sustainable Enterprise is a community of practice supporting the work of diverse researchers, educators and business professionals who share a focus on sustainable enterprise.
Many of today’s business priorities relate to society and the environment. Resource constraints, demographic change, disruptive technologies, bio-physical crises such as climate change and bio-diversity loss and other transformative trends, emerging risks, and shifting expectations are challenging business models and the notion of business itself.
Scientists tell us we are transitioning into a period where humankind has become the dominant earth-shaping force - a new geological and cultural era which they have called the Anthropocene. (For more information on the Anthropocene visit the Age of Transition website.)
What does it mean to do business in a time when our species is disrupting the life support systems of the planet? How can we refashion our institutions and our professional practice to face a period of environmental and social upheaval and profound uncertainty?
Our response is to rethink and remake business in a time when 'business-as-usual' is no longer a viable option. Through our research, teaching, professional engagement and networks, we want to accelerate the transition to sustainable enterprise within the challenging context of the Anthropocene. The Hub's objective is to improve human and societal wellbeing and to maintain and restore stocks of natural capital. We support businesses that are restorative, circular and regenerative.

Rachel - UTS Business School  00:02
Okay, good evening, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us for this evening’s webinar, where we will be going through UTS Business School's Bachelor of Accounting coop scholarship program. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation upon whose ancestral lands our city campus now stands. I would also like to pay respect to the elders both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land. I'm also conscious that as a webinar, we're zooming in from all different areas. So I would also like to extend that acknowledgement to the traditional owners of the land that you're zooming in from as well. Now, before we get started, I'd just like to bring to your attention that this session will be recorded. So we won't be using anyone's names when we do q&a. So there's still anonymity there, but just letting you know that it will be recorded. Oops, just jumping ahead there. So this is a very interactive session, we know that you've probably got a lot of questions. If you do have any, we really strongly encourage you to hit the q&a button just at the bottom of your Zoom taskbar. And we will be responding to certain questions during the session. And we will also be chatting through some of them at the end as well. Now, my name is Rachel and I have the pleasure of working in the student recruitment team at UTS. Joining me this evening is Michelle Cook, who's the director of The Bachelor of Accounting program, as well as Bianca Buckman, who is a partner at PwC, who is one of our fantastic sponsor organizations. We're also joined by first-year BAcc students, Bianca and John, third-year student, Ethan, who's currently completing his second internship, and also Georgia who finished the course last year and is now working as a grad at KPMG. In the background is Carin who works with Michelle on the BAcc program, and she'll be answering any questions that come through during the session. And as I mentioned, we'll also be answering questions at the end of the session two. So any questions that you do see come through, you can upvote them. So you know, if there's a question you don't need to ask again, you can just upvote it. And we will respond to that as well. Being a webinar, I know we're in year three of a lot of virtual events. So you're probably well-versed in troubleshooting. But please bear with us. If there are any technical issues, we'll work to resolve them as quickly as possible. If you find you're not able to access the webinar, at any point, usually the old logging out and logging back in again, excuse me, usually resolves such issues. So tonight, we're going to be presenting on the following topics, what the Bachelor of Accounting actually is, what the core structure is, our sponsors, how the internships work, the career options available, the application process, as well as q&a. So, Michelle, thank you so much for joining us. One of the questions we get asked all the time is, what exactly is the Bachelor of Accounting? How is it different to the Bachelor of Business with a major in accounting? Can you give us a bit of an overview on that? Oh, I think you're on mute Michelle.
 
Michelle Cook  03:46
Oh, my gosh, after all this time zoom ever I think I've learned as the words came, I was on mute. So I do apologize. But I just welcome you to this webinar. And I hope that we can answer some of the questions that you might have about the Bachelor of Accounting programZoom. So how is it different from the Bachelor of Business? Well, I started called back as we call it, a Bachelor of Business on steroids, because we do it so much faster than the normal Bachelor of Business. And within the Bachelor of Accounting program, you are required to do an accounting major. And we'll go more into the structure of those things a little bit later. Nothing that really sets it apart from the Bachelor of Business is that you do get to six-month internships, which is full-time with one of our sponsor organizations. And you also get a scholarship of up to about $56,000 Over the three years. So the other major differentiators about the program and also the tight-knit sort of cohort, because there's usually only about 30 to 35 students in the actual intake itself. It says that sort of answer your question, Rachel.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  04:54
Absolutely. Brianna, I might also throw to you as well because obviously you were sitting where a lot of our attendees were sitting this time last year. So what did you kind of think accounting was when you were wondering what course to choose and what you thought it was turned out to be the reality.
 
05:15
Look, before I went through the rabbit hole that was researching BAcc, I thought accounting was, you know, the old number crunching, you know, debits, credits and all that. But I've come into the course it's not that at all. You know, you do so much business. So my subjects right now are so far outside of business as well. There's like economics. There's statistics as this sudden other and it's just so broad and saturated. I don't think I could have imagined what it was before actually joined.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  05:46
When and Georgia, obviously, you're even further on the other side of things as a graduate. Do you want to add anything to what Brianna said as an alum and from you know, your based on your work experience and internships?
 
Georgia - BAcc Student  06:01
Yeah, I can basically echo what Brianna said, I thought accounting would basically be all numbers number crunching, as mentioned by Brianna, really complex mathematics, and truly be super boring as there's a common perception that accounting is very, very boring, sitting at your desk all day, no social life, as well as the people too. But my experiences have been like the polar opposite. The math is very straightforward. Even if you have a basic do basic math, at scope, I was gonna say University, oh my gosh, I'm way past that now. School are more than capable of completing the BAcc. As well as the people I've met within studying accounting. They're not boring people at all. They're very insightful and passionate, such as my lecture as people out in the workforce when I've undertaken my internships. And that's something I really value and have, like, come to learn. It's an amazing career to have. But all in all, I guess, through studying accounting, through studying back at university, I've learned the importance of accounting in business, which really plays to the fact that accounting is the Language of Business. And yeah, it differentiates you from any other business student, which is amazing.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  07:17
Excellent. Thank you so much, Georgia. Now, the Bachelor of Accounting is a very competitive course. Michelle, we do expect a lot from our backs. What are you looking for from our current students? Oh, I think you're on mute again, Michelle.
 
Michelle Cook  07:41
I'm sorry, we have new systems. And so my webcams Oh, sorry to everyone. So I've been trying to place it so you can see me properly. So I apologize profusely, but we'll get it right. But we do we look for and expect of our students, we expect them to be nice people. We want them to have curiosity, humility. It's not only about taking a position in this program, it's also understanding the privilege you're given to have a life changing moment, and how do we contribute that back into our society. So part of our mission statement is to create future business leaders using accounting as a foundation. But I sort of add on to that, and also with the humility and respect to give back to society, because that's what we sort of stand for at UTS as well. So we do expect a lot, but we give a lot to in order to develop students in so many ways, so that they can become I suppose the best of themselves and the best person they can be.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  08:37
Absolutely. Now, Jahn, obviously, you know, you're in first year, you've just come off the back of the HSC. How do you find the workload in the program?
 
08:50
At the moment, look, the workload is it's pretty good, fast track period, which all the students will go through that is lengthy. We're not lengthy at all. It's actually really brief. But there is a big workload in that. And I think it depends how much you sort of do outside of University. I'm myself, I'm at college where there are a lot of other responsibilities. So I do I often find myself having instances where I got I've got a lot to do right now. But as I always say to people, being busy is not a bad thing. I definitely prefer being busy than being bored. So it's definitely manageable to say have a job. I know Brianna works a job outside of uni at the moment. So let's definitely do one first semester, but you probably wouldn't be able to do in second semester as you already be working a full time job, but it's definitely manageable, I'd say.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  09:39
Excellent. And Michelle, Jahn just mentioned fast track, which a lot of our viewers might be wondering what exactly is fast track.
 
Michelle Cook  09:50
So we start very early in the year. We have to let you know, we start early to allow you to have that six months period in your first day to do internships. So we come straight from the fireworks of Christmas, straight into the third of January. And we start. And they do a thing as a dimension called Fast Track. So first is we'll do two subjects in six weeks. So and you do it in block moto come to me for nine to five every day. And you do a tutorial and a lecture in one in one day itself. And then, of course, you do the various assessments that go with that. But that will then allows them so much time to do that six month internship. And that's why we actually do fast track. So we do fast track in first year, with two subjects and fast track in second year with one subject in that summer period.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  10:45
Excellent. And Georgia. How do you find looking back on you know, juggling Fast Track juggling internships juggling some semblance of a social life? Do you feel that that helped prepare you for full time work?
 
Georgia - BAcc Student  11:00
Most definitely, I wouldn't trade it for anything. When you're in the moment, you definitely think it's a bit overwhelming, you have to learn what we call is like we've got buckets, we've got a social bucket, we've got like a study bucket, which is where your education goes into, then you have other buckets as well, you've got to learn how to manage your time and put as much water time into the buckets as you wish. And that definitely translates into the workforce. So as Michelle has mentioned, we get to six month internships where you have to study alongside it simultaneously. I would say this definitely helped prepare me for juggling commitments at KPMG. Because I'm also completing my Chartered Accountants. So that study alongside working exactly the same as what we did in Deac. As well as within beer, we're also encouraged to take place in clubs and societies as well. So not only on top of work, then University, then clubs, then you got clubs and societies, that also takes up another portion of your time. So now I look back on it, I definitely wouldn't trade it for anything. I've been able to prioritize my time coming into KPMG. I feel like I have a lot more time up my sleeves. Maybe it's just because studying is not as intense. But yeah, it's, it's great.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  12:15
Excellent, fantastic. And I love your analogy about the buckets and ensuring that they're all They're all adequately watered. I think that's great advice for a lot of our attendees who are probably feeling a little under the pump with their HSc year. Now, Michelle, obviously, you spoke a little bit about Fast Track and what that is, but would you be able to talk us through exactly how the course works,
 
Michelle Cook  12:41
So as I said, you have to do a major in accounting. So what does a major mean at uni, it means eight subjects a specific to that. area. So in accounting, you would do caught you do eight subjects, you do come in in your first year, you do a general degree. So you touch on each bit, you do a bit of marketing a bit of economics, as Brianna was saying. And it gives you a wide range of interests that you might want to pursue besides the accounting degree, then you do your accounting majors are saying, which is eight subjects. And then what I love about UTS is the flexibility in the choice of what you do after that, you can either choose to do another major, for example, finance, or you can do that. So that's eight subjects, or you can do to specialist subjects in whatever you choose to do, which is amazing, which is four subjects and four subjects. A lot of students that are in their third year, will choose to do a sub major. So do four subjects. And then they finished the other four electives overseas. So we've had people go to I know in this year to Milan, to the US to Switzerland, and then finish their degree overseas. So there it is very broad in what you couldn't do, and also really broad in how you can develop yourself. Because for me, it's about learning. Like you should really try and explore all the different options that you can to become a really holistic and professional person. So that's sort of how we work our majors and sub majors. And as I said, it runs as per the business degree, but we just do have to do a major in accounting.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  14:23
Exactly. And I think it's important to note as well that you don't need to have a set idea of what you want to do. So there's a lot of options there. And the beauty is that you do get exposed to those different areas of business. So you could very well go in thinking economics is something I definitely want to specialize in and then you know, you might think oh actually marketing is more appealing or I want to pair finance with accounting. Brianna, which kind of boat were you in? Did you come into the course knowing exactly how you wanted to specialize or have you decided yet or whereabouts are you Look when
 
15:01
I entered the course, I mean, like, you always have some idea floating around, but I wasn't set on a path. And I'm still not set on our path yet. I'm in my first year. So I have a lot of time to decide that especially looking at this internships and getting to experience those, but currently, I'm leaning more towards funds management, sort of the investment area, I'm really excited to get into the internship just to see how you know, life and annuities goes, but ya know, still not sure you don't have to be sure. Michelle is not going to look at you and go she she doesn't know what she wants to do. We're not going to take you like, yeah, a lot of my friends and I we have no idea exactly what we're doing with the rest of our lives.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  15:45
Excellent. Excellent. And, Jahn, what about yourself? Do you know what you want to specialize in?
 
15:52
Um, yes, at the moment. So sort of similar to be honest, do very, keeping my options open, I think that's one of the great things about the program is you get exposed to so many different areas. And that will allow you to keep an open mind, you allow yourself to gain so many experiences. So as Briana sort of touched on, we've got our internships coming up. So that'd probably be a really good experience, we can see things that we like and see what we don't like. And then from that, we can sort of gauge as to where we might like to go. But at the moment, I'm in regards to selecting my second major, I've thought about maybe economics, or doing a sub major with something similar to economics and in any business law, because I just remembered in school in the HSC are, obviously business interests me, but also Legal Studies and Economics where I really enjoyed those. So that might be something I'd like to pursue in the future. But it's definitely good to keep an open mind. And if you already have an open mind, that's great, because you can just sort of gauge things as you go, and then decide where you want to go. And you've got a bit of experience.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  16:50
Excellent, fantastic. And really great advice as well. Georgia, obviously, you've been through the process, what did you choose to major in or do a sub major in?
 
Georgia - BAcc Student  17:01
Yeah, of course. Um, so basically, as mentioned, we have to do a compulsory major in accounting to start off with so one of my majors was accounting. Then in the second half, I actually did a sub major in finance than I need for elective. So it's presented on the right hand, very right hand side of the screen. I chose a sub major in finance, as I've always been very mathematical. I came into the UK actually wanting to do finance. So yeah, I was set on it from the start. A lot of people aren't, though, as Bianna and John said, You got to keep open minded because you go through experiences that shape what you want to do at university. That yeah, I guess I was slightly different. But it's very, very common to be thinking that way. Um, I found in all the subjects within the accounting major and the finance sub major, to be very hands on and practical, which is what I loved on as you're constantly learning, we're constantly learning about huge corporations are learning how to read financial statements, and ultimately provide me with that experience. And that foundation to venture out into any aspect of the corporate world, which I found really important. Then I guess, to top off my degree, I chose some electives, which are the four little individual slots on the right hand side of the screen, just to diversify my knowledge and to really choose subjects I was interested in, but I couldn't encapsulate in one sub major. So I did subjects ranging from management to it. And I think there are a few marketing subjects in there as well. And every subject was super insightful and very, very relevant in the current world. And I can give a brief example, my it subject, I completed during the time that Optus had their massive data breach, and we were actually like security and data at that time. So yeah, it's, it's great having the flexibility of adding on to sub majors are some major and electives as you can really tailor your degree to suit what you want to pursue and what you want to learn.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  19:00
Excellent. And I think your point as well about the practicality, you know, you're studying financial statements, you were studying case study in real time with Optus, seeing how they responded, seeing how it happened, like yes, in the real time nature is is very apparent. Now, obviously, uni life goes beyond the classroom and, you know, the social component of uni generally, it's really important. Michelle, there's a lot of talk about the BAcc family. I think you might have actually mentioned that earlier as well. And how valuable is that for our students? Can you talk a little bit about the close knit nature of the course.
 
Michelle Cook  19:45
Absolutely. I don't think people really believe me and I think Brianna and the other banks on the call will agree with me say you will your edge mates and the closest friends you've ever had. And and you really do but I think The beauty of it is that we do lots of things, we really try and look after each other. So we have, we've got your back to mentoring program. So we're people are mentored from the year above them. And you're above that. And so we have mentoring trees. And usually we get together once a session with each other, I think, I think the first year, we've had dinners and all sorts of things, and coffee cat jobs with their buddy. And we try and expand that right to the alumni. So that once a year, we get all get together in that tree. So we can try and help each other. And I think that's a really important part of the fabric of back is that we do look after each other. And there's nothing that you need to worry about, because you'll have so much support going through the program. And I think there's the BI Bowl coming up. On next Saturday, I think everyone's very stressed about what they're going to wear. And there's not only they don't only work hard and support each other in that, there's also a fantastic social element. And I think it's really been accentuated because we all found out what it's like not to be connected during COVID. So it's a real hunger, I think, for people to connect with each other, and have all those different as aspects of getting to know one another and have a supportive environment.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  21:28
Absolutely. Jahn, now, I believe that you're actually from Orange, is that correct? Um, yeah,
 
21:35
I am. So I had moved to Sydney in fast track. But um, yeah, so did you have like a follow up on that? Perfect.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  21:44
No, I did. So you know, obviously, did you know anyone, you know, coming into the course, I mean, because you obviously didn't just have a new course and a new university environment, you had a completely new city as well.
 
21:58
Yeah. So um, fortunately, I have like a lot of family in Sydney, and my brother lived in Sydney. So I moved to one of the Sydney Uni colleges. So they were really great. But, um, it was somewhat of a daunting experience. At first, I knew no one that was in the cohort. I did know some other people that have done the program. That's actually how I heard about it. But within my ego, I didn't know anyone but um, it's quite a daunting experience going on the first day sort of going in, but um, as Michelle and everyone's talked about this, they have family and having great friendships, the any of the like, berries or whatever, everything was broken instantly. And as first year students, you have your first orientation day, then you go into camp, on a farm out near Mittagong through the barrel area. And that is just the biggest icebreaker in itself. That's where a lot of the friendships are made. And it's just a great experience. And then from then on, after the camp, you start the Fast Track period, which is obviously academic stuff, it's really nice to have that period of just getting to know each other. So I'd say yeah, for me, the whole move itself, it's honestly been a breeze, making friends has been a breeze. And it's just been a great time so far. Yeah.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  23:08
Excellent, fantastic. And Brianna, sometimes we hear that in your 12. You know, obviously, you've got your friendships, you've gone through high school with them. But sometimes it can be quite competitive people keen to get first in advanced English or whatever. Whereas at university, and especially in the Bachelor of Accounting, everyone's quite collegial. Do you find that there's a lot of assistance in the program? You can bounce ideas off each other?
 
23:38
Yeah, look, it's definitely a lot different from high school. Even in high school, I wasn't very stingy about sharing my notes. But here, it's a whole new level like you wouldn't believe, to a point where like, we might get a bit of disapproval for it. Because we will sit next to each other and do quizzes together, weekly quizzes that come out every Tuesday, there are three of them. And we all just sit together and do them. There's no sort of competition between who will do the best. I mean, there's friendly competition, you know, there's a little bit going on about between two of our BX about who's going to do better, but it's all friendly competition, none of us are gonna go back and give you the wrong answers or stab each other in the backs because we want to do better. It's all very uplifting environment, you're always gonna get help. So for us, we have this big, big group chat with all three of 36 of us. And you can send questions in there any point in the day and someone will help you out. And it's just a very, very welcoming, welcoming environment that just allows you to do really well academically as well.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  24:44
Excellent, fantastic. And Georgia you mentioned clubs and societies as well. Do you want to chat to us a little bit about some of the clubs and societies you were part of and, and also as an alum, like, do you still keep in touch with A lot of your back cohort. So a bit of a two fold question for you. Yeah,
 
Georgia - BAcc Student  25:05
I'll read the former first. So um, some clubs and societies I was involved in is women in business or they're amazing at like empowering females towards leadership opportunities. And anything in the corporate environment, it's a great space. I was also highly involved, there's probably one extra one that I would say I was most involved in, which was case team case team is a massive thing, especially with BX on there are a lot of bx tend to be involved in case 10, there's an opportunity to travel overseas with the funded by the university, and it's basically a competition where it's a competition, and companies provide a stimulus, and you have to try and solve real life business problems for them. In a short period of time, some of them, you may only have three hours to find the solution for the problem. Some of them can be six hours, some of them could be 24 hours, it completely depends. But that's an amazing, I guess, you'd say it's both a club and a society, because you get to travel with it. Um, but yeah, highly recommend engaging yourself in case team or any other even any other club or society, you're more than welcome to join, and everyone will take you in. And there's such great opportunities. There are also cultural societies, you can join through clubs, dog society, cat society, on the range is so diverse, and it's tailored to every single person. Next part of the question, do I maintain social connections? Yes, I definitely did. And our cohort definitely did. So Brianna mentioned their cohort was is 36 students, we only had 27 in our cohort. So we were very, very closely knit and has still remained in contact, whether I'm texting them, whether we're creating social events together, or even run into them in the city. And that connection never gets lost, which I think is an amazing benefit of the B app program. The fact that the connections don't just exist at university, that beyond University too. And just to add one small thing is that it's not only within your cohort, either, you become really close to the cohorts above the cohorts below you, which I think is also really important, because like I said, I run into people in the city, I'm not just running into people in my cohort, you're running into people who are two years above you or two years below, and you can see them really develop. And it's it's amazing to see.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  27:27
Excellent, fantastic, thank you for sharing your experience as well. Now, obviously, we wouldn't have the Bachelor of Accounting if it weren't for our sponsors. Now, obviously, a huge part of the way that the sponsors are involved is throughout internships, and we'll be speaking about those in just a little while. But Michelle, how else do our students network with our sponsors?
 
Michelle Cook  27:59
We have so many events that we can form a relationship with both the students and also the sponsors. And the sponsors are just so generous in giving their time. And also trying to develop the next, I suppose future leaders and developing young talent. And so we do things like the first year guest lectures. Amazing. So students will be out of school, high school for a matter of months. And they'll be meeting partners like Bianca from PWC. They'll be meeting CEOs CFOs of some of these companies, which are actually some of the biggest companies in Australia, if not the world. So those are some of the things we also have events where they'll come and students get the opportunity to network right across the board and develop really good skills on relationship building. With the sponsors, we have create career expos, which is only for vx and the sponsors. So a multitude of events where students really get to be, I suppose, in the face of the C suite, which is unknown at a university in the university, even some people in industry or would not have those opportunities. So we are very, very lucky with the generosity as I was saying all have our sponsors and the time they give to develop our fantastic bx.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  29:16
Well, speaking of the generosity of the time of our sponsors, it's a great segue to throw to Bianca PwC has been such a great supporter of the program, and has been a sponsor for so many years now. What was it that made PwC decide to come on board as a sponsor.
 
29:39
Thanks, Rachel. And good evening, everyone. As Rachel said, I'm Bianca Buckman a partner at PwC in our Sydney office, working in our financial services assurance team. And you can see here I have my accounting CA certificate in the background as well. So a very great qualification that that I encourage you all to Do, Rachel To be honest, I actually don't know what year we became a sponsor. But it was well before I was involved, so I can't speak for back then. But I can speak for now as to why we continue to sponsor the program. That, I guess the way I think about it is, the quality of the students that come out of this program is in a league of its own, it's exceptional. I have seen a number of our interns and then people who come and come and work with us at as a graduate afterwards, and the quality and like their, their way they think they're very well rounded individuals. They've got the accounting qualification qualification in terms of their major, they've got work experience with them. They just stand out when we're going through graduate programs. So essentially, I've probably seen the majority that come through to PwC. As graduates, they ended up being our top rated performers for the time that they are with the firm. So I did, we just actually had one UTS Co Op alumni become a partner this year. So that was pretty exciting. And I've seen a number of them do other things with their careers as well, which is fantastic. But to me, it's the part of what I love is that Michelle and the team go through such a rigorous process. And it's so competitive in terms of who they accept into the program, that they've done all the hard work for me as a sponsor. So I know that anyone who's in this program is going to be an exceptionally high quality candidate to come into the firm as a graduate. And I love being able to, to know that and rely on that year after a year.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  32:07
Excellent, fantastic. And yeah, just knowing that you can bank on it is, as you say, a real relief,
 
32:13
you feel like a lot of the hard work is done for you. Exactly.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  32:18
So when we talk about internships, because obviously it's such a huge part of the program, both in terms of time experience, and and for the graduates as well actually coming out with that year. But sometimes we find that the word internship conjures images of photocopying, and making coffee and you know, going and fetching, you know, dry cleaning and things like that, which you know, isn't exactly the case. Bianca, would you be able to talk us through some of the kinds of kinds of work that our interns do do at PWC?
 
32:53
Yeah, absolutely. So when any of your students come and intern with us, we actually treat them, they start with a graduate and trainee cohort that all start at the same time. And frankly, they get treated exactly the same. So they come in, they're not treated like an intern, most people don't even realize that they're an intern, they'll just think they're one of the grads, or trainees starting with us at that time. So when they joined, they will have two weeks of pretty intense training with us to learn the basics around auditing and audit methodology. And then they'll be pretty much straight on client engagements. So straight out with the team, looking after particular areas of the audit. And so looking at, I guess what we sort of think is our foundation level areas of auditing parts of the financial statements of companies. And so they'll be on the job with their teams being coached by their team members to learn and understand how to do the work that they need to do. And then we'll be doing that, that involves talking directly with the client building relationships with the client, learning the technical aspects of audit methodology, learning about audit quality, how to document their work, so I definitely don't send my juniors on coffee runs. So that that doesn't happen. I don't think sometimes they might volunteer, but we all take turns. But it's really you get thrown straight into the thick of the the engagement work that that we all do. So it's some, it can sometimes be a little bit full on and probably overwhelming at the beginning. But you you see them from sort of day one through to six months. And it's amazing watching the journey they go on in terms of how capable they are by the end of the six months and how much they've really learned that's allowed them to put the things that they've been learning at university into practice on a day to day perspective, which is a huge plus for them when they're going out into the world to become a graduate, whether it's with PwC, another sponsor or elsewhere, they already have a year experience working in an accounting field under their belt, which again, sets them apart from the competition as they're working through graduate program recruit recruitment programs.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  35:25
Excellent, fantastic. And Georgia, obviously, as we've said, you're on the other side of things as a as an alumni now, how did you find the internship process? Especially how, you know, how did you find the tasks different in first year versus in third year?
 
Georgia - BAcc Student  35:44
Yeah, I guess the process in general, just to make it clear, Michelle is very, very good at considering your preferences to where you want to be placed, but also knowing that organization that you'd fit best in. So that also plays Michelle strengths, she has done it for a very, very long time. She knows if you may put in a preference to where you want to get placed, and you may not get your preference. But guess what every single company that sponsors the program, as incredible from start to finish, and you have an amazing experience, based off my experiences, so my first internship was at Coca Cola Amatil, which is now Coco, your Pacific partners, oh, my gosh, that was four years ago, I have to retrace my memory. I was in a finance roles are chief reporting to the Chief Financial Controller. So I was doing accounting work, budgets, on what else SAP everything from that aspect, which is completely different to my second internship, which was with Bianca PWC. I was in order at PWC. So working on the complete opposite side of the accounting aspects rather than producing the numbers. This time, I was trying to verify the numbers. Yeah, which was actually a great experience, I really enjoyed the audit side of things, because I had to be analytical had to really search awareness states could pop up, had to understand the process from start to finish, it wasn't just looking at the financial statements being like, Hmm, that number seems large, let me investigate that, or that number is too small, I'm not going to investigate that. There's more of a procedure to that, which is what I really enjoy. And I'm doing audit at KPMG. Now, which is very, very similar to PwC. And it's definitely where I want to be audit is where I want to be. Yeah, I loved accounting, but I think what it stretches me that tiny bit more, which is something I've always looked for and want to push those boundaries. So yeah, they're incredible. Like I said, I'm not going to point out any sponsors, because they're all incredible. And any single company that you go to, you're going to have an amazing experience with.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  37:58
Excellent, thank you so much, Bianca. And, again, I just want to touch on as well, the fact that you mentioned that Michelle, actually tailors, you know, takes preferences into account, but also tailors your strengths and skills. So, Michelle, again, that's just evidence of how closely you do work with our students. You know, can you give us a couple of examples of, you know, how you how you're able to match them up, and you know, what you kind of look for?
 
Michelle Cook  38:25
Yes, I will, people are different developmental stages in their lives. And we have to be very aware of that, we have to look at how we can develop them, but also make sure they have a great experience in the corporate world. So when I was sitting in, I was thinking about, thank you very much for the kind words, Georgia that I was thinking about, Oh my gosh, imagine I'm sitting there about to do my HSC. And oh, my gosh, I'll go into a six month internship. The world is actually a very commonplace, and we know how we develop your skills, you're never thrown into the deep end, you always have someone that will help you. And we just try and mimic that. So there are times when you will talk to me, you might you might know what all these companies do. But hopefully I do. I always say the backs you don't know what you don't know, that always open your mind to embracing so many different things. So we do get to know you quite well. Because we see each other a lot. And then we talk about you where you'd like to go where where you where we maybe can develop skills, where that skills in confidence, skills in people management, you know, the whole gamut of the professional world, that and I suppose attributes that we really like to say, and then we try and match that with companies. So some people will be better maybe in the first entrance at a smaller company. Others will be better at a bigger company. It's oh so many So many variables, it's amazing. But it really does all work out. And I think, from the internships you get, get a greater sense of self. And I love when you come to me after those six months, just your growth is just phenomenal, then that just an amazing sort of experience it I think, that is quite unique to back, then we track your growth. And really, we never let you go. So there's no such thing as a back alumni. So Georgia, you're always just to be
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  40:34
fantastic. And just circling back to our sponsors, specifically PWC. I've, I've just been messaged by the lovely Kern who said that PwC have actually been a supporter since 1995.
 
40:49
Wow. 20
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  40:51
years. So obviously, well before your time. But again, that's really, really testament to the relationship that PwC has with UTS. And, and I know speaking on behalf of UTS, we are incredibly grateful for all of the experience and all of the support that we've had over those 28. Fantastic.
 
41:15
It's been a pleasure, we love getting the students. So it's, we always get excited when we have some coming through as graduates. So it's fabulous.
 
Michelle Cook  41:26
And just to mention, too, that at the moment, Biak the Co Op program has the most sponsors in accounting, any company of any co op in Australia, which we're also very, very proud of.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  41:42
Absolutely. Hence why this year has been a bigger cohort than traditional year. So I know that we've had a question come through that said, for 2024, would we be looking for approximately 30? Students? Michelle, do you want to answer that one?
 
Michelle Cook  41:59
Um, you know, I will? I won't know. I hate to make commitments like that, because you're not sure. But I would hope that, you know, we would be able to maintain the level we have and maybe go a little bit further.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  42:13
Excellent, fantastic. I'm sorry. Now, we've mentioned that, you know, the course can be diversified depending on your interest. We've mentioned that when you graduate with a Bachelor of Accounting, that doesn't mean that you're going to be changed to a calculator and a bean counter or anything like that. Michelle, what kind of roles can graduates expect to work in?
 
Michelle Cook  42:41
Well, you know, we have a BAcc only LinkedIn page. And it's just amazing. The diversity of careers that you could explore through accounting is absolutely incredible. One of our alumni who's just finished in the role, but he was the CFO, Paramount Pictures in Los Angeles. And I love that, you know, when you watch the movies next time, everyone just have a little look, because he will say credits to accountants. Don't you love that? I love that. I do. I do. Yeah. And every every single organization that you can think of needs accountants, and quite desperately, and I'm sure Bianca will elaborate on that in a moment. But I look at accounting as Swiss, we always call it the Language of Business. But it's actually the Swiss Army knife of industry. Because, you know, there's a Swiss Army knives and all the different components of it as a component for every single business. And you can go from accounting into every other sector, whether that be marketing, etc. But you can't come the other way. Absolutely. And what we're finding more and more is that the skills that all our alumni say that they use every day, no matter what role they eventually take, is accounting skills. That's why That's why they're the CFOs the CEOs, because everyone has to know how money goes in and money comes out. It's such an important language and essential for, I suppose, the continuous running of a nation.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  44:09
Absolutely, yeah. Absolutely. And so, you
 
Michelle Cook  44:12
know, so if so, it'll be interesting, you know, go on to places like LinkedIn, search accountants, and see what they actually do. It's quite amazing. What do you think, Bianca?
 
44:25
I completely agree, Michelle. So I actually think of people with accounting degrees as well rounded business people. So you know, I'm an audit partner at PWC. But when people say to me, what do you do? I say, you know, I work with clients to give society trust in their results in financial statements. I help them solve problems, and I work with them on whatever is priority for them. The number of my clients I regularly deal with see suite across ASX 50, through to much smaller clients, the majority of C suite clients have their ca qualifications in terms of their Chartered Accountants. And so to me, it's a ticket to being a well rounded business person, whatever you decide to do. And I think that's the really big selling point around doing an accounting degree and something like BIAC, where you combine that with practical experience.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  45:34
Excellent, fantastic. Thanks, Bianca. Um, now, obviously, we've spoken a lot about what the Course entails what it's like from, you know, our current students, prospective sponsors, alumni, but for our, you know, people currently tuning in a lot of them are year 12. Michel, how do they actually apply for the course? What are you looking for?
 
Michelle Cook  45:59
Yeah. So how you apply first of all, as you put an online application in, but and the first round is 19th of May. And people say, Why do you have a first round and a second round. And really, some people are going to do a few things maybe before the October close date, which is the 13th of October, and they might want to have that on their CV. But what I say is if your CV and current current and I say if your CV is ready, and you put it in now, because you'll get it before you have the pressures of the HSE. From them, it gets cold. So I look for problem solving, leadership, volunteering experience, we weren't all around people. We're not just looking for, you know, the person who gets the highest scores, but can't speak to someone. Because when we just take a step backwards, when you look at what professional skills you need, it's things like communication, curiosity, problem solving. What is what are your What are your other interests, because we're not just an island of HSC? Thank heavens, we are more than that. And that's what we're looking for. We're looking for great all around people. And I always say, even in the interviews, when you get to interview, and I hope you do, I say I just look for nice people. Just nice people, don't worry about the ATAR. Don't worry, it's not about that. It's about who you are as a human and what you can contribute back to the program, and be what are one of our ambassadors really, because that's what you are beauty is when you go into all the different things you do. So from that period, we go into an interview interviews are from them, I always have to look at the you know, the old age brain, make sure about the right dates from the sixth or the 10th to November, you book him for a session, and then we give you yummy, yummy food. So very important. And you have a group assessment. So that means you have a group of four, we give you a problem to work on together. And we look at how you collaborate, how you work within the team. And then after that, you just go into a brief. And I'm not going to call it an interview, I'm going to call it a conversation. It's a conversation with some people about what you've done, what you're proud of. And where do you see yourself going. And from there, we then go into you might be shortlisted and hopefully get a call from me, after eight hours are released to offer you a position in the program, which is one of my happiest days.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  48:38
Absolutely. I have seen you on off a day it is one of your favorite days. So again, just we've had a question come through about how to prepare for the interview. But Michelle, I think you answered it, be yourself have that authenticity.
 
Michelle Cook  48:55
Yeah. Absolutely. And, you know, never be scared of an opportunity. So be Act is an opportunity. But I always say to everyone who applies is a really big secret i i learned learned a long time ago, and that's no doesn't hurt. But if you don't give yourself the opportunity to get the chance, then that's when you're letting yourself down. So, you know, apply, try and come to the interviews I say and I think I've said that for a few years now. But it's like wanting to win lotto and not getting a ticket. Yes, like it did you use them again. It's never gonna happen. So apply, see where they get you. And I promise you if you connect with some BX or any BX all of them will say I never ever thought I'd get in. And there they are now having a life changing and very empowering experience because they put their hand up and gave themselves a chance. So put your applications in. I sound like wearing There's commercials for knives or something. I really am very passionate about the program. And I'd love to see you also have the chance to be part of it.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  50:08
Excellent. Thanks for showing fantastic advice as well. We've had a question come in about when it comes to your 12 HSC reports. Do we have a mandatory rank? And no, not the case at all? Now we're having a, as I said, we've got a little bit of time for questions as well. We've had some that come through. We'll give attendees a couple of minutes while they're getting this questions in. I'm going to throw to Georgia, Brianna. And then John in that order. As I said, you're on the other side of the HSA, obviously, with the benefit of your experience so far, what advice would you give your HSA self?
 
Georgia - BAcc Student  50:56
Oh, this is difficult. Um, I think, in general, echoing what Michelle said that every opportunity you don't take is a missed opportunity. If you don't apply for the app, guess what you're not gonna get in because you haven't applied. It's as simple as that. So just apply even if you're a bit unsure as to what you want to do. If you don't apply, you're gonna miss out. And it's an incredible opportunity, incredible experience. And it's an amazing program that I would recommend every single person if I could, who wants to take business? Who wants to do accounting, everything like that? Just just apply? That's all I'd say. Justify.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  51:35
Excellent, Briana.
 
51:40
I'm gonna go with two actually. I have. The first one is I like to go into things with the mindset of what's the worst that can happen within reason. Within reason, obviously, you know, when I was applying for this course, I thought, Oh, look, it's a really, really competitive course. What are the chances I get in but I thought, you know, what's the worst that can happen? They can say no, and I can be on my way. But yeah, like George just said, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take so, you know, go into it thinking what's the worst that can happen? If the worst thing can happen is someone saying no to you, I really don't think it's that bad. Just have big crack at it. And the other thing is, if you do something, put 100% of your effort in. And so if you're going to do it fully commit, so whether or not you get into B Act, the course itself, put 100% of effort into whatever you're doing. If you're doing the HSC if you're there while you're there, put 100% of your energy in and once you walk out, it's over. It's done. But yeah, you don't want to have a walk out of somewhere thinking, Oh, maybe I could have put in a little bit more effort. You don't want to look back with that sort of regret.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  52:44
Excellent. Again, great advice. John, it's always hard going last. You got any other advice that you'd like to add?
 
52:53
No worries, probably the only thing I could say is sort of, as everyone's mentioned, there is no harm in a bind. The worst scenario sort of Briana said, the worst case scenario is you don't get in and you've written a great CV, you've written an application, and you've just had an interview experience that is both individual and networking sort of component and start when you meet people, and then group activities. And then presenting your idea, your resolution to the question. And then an individual interview, which mom was a chairman, we talked about dual labor for 10 minutes of all things. But yeah, the worst that can happen is you write a great CV, you have an interview experience, and you've just gained two great things, but just apply. So as HSC students, I know you've got a lot going on. I know I got on the application process early. As I thought, Look, I'm already tight for time. Now imagine how top of time I'm going to be in the future as we get close to exams. So I would recommend students to get on it now, as opposed to later I think it's, I always just felt more comfortable when I have gone through, I've got my internship secured, I can, sorry, not my internship at an interview secured, I can put that to his side for now and think about my studies. And we'll get to that later. So there is no problem in applying. It'll take a few hours to write a good reference or whatever good application. But yeah, so many benefits of just applying in itself. And by the chance you get in life changing experience. That's
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  54:19
excellent, great advice. Thank you, John. will now be answering some of your questions. I know Karen has been furiously answering. So to give her fingers a little bit of a break. We'll answer some of them live. Now this is a really common one. Say someone submitted their application, the cutoff date comes and goes. Michelle, how soon do they usually find out whether they've been successful in securing an interview or not?
 
Michelle Cook  54:45
In a week? Week? Fantastic. So closures that brighter than 90 the following Friday, they'll know whether they've secured an interview.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  54:53
Excellent, fantastic. Yes, exactly. Now, we've had another question come through that says, and again, I'm loving it because it's chronologically. So say they do make it to the interview stage. How long is the interview?
 
Michelle Cook  55:09
Oh, well, it's about 40 minutes in, in the lab doing the group assessment, because we tried to get to know each other first time relax a little bit. And then they have time to solve the problem and present their solution, as John was saying, then they will have an interview. And that's roughly about 20 to 25 minutes per interview.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  55:34
Excellent, fantastic. Now, if someone applies for round one, but is unsuccessful, can they apply again for round two?
 
Michelle Cook  55:46
I've forgotten is that dual? Applying for round one and then trying again, for round two. We don't generally allow that selection criteria remains. But the selection criteria alignment remains the same. And yeah, yeah. So they said that's. So that's why I'm saying if you think you are going to do a bit more for your CV, then maybe apply and happening by the 13th of October.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  56:18
Excellent. And someone is also asked, What do we need to submit for the second round of applications? It's exactly the same as the first round of application. Yes.
 
Michelle Cook  56:25
The only reason we had that is it's terrible wording. I know, and I'm so sorry, we've been trying to find a better way to sort of explain it. So first round, is, in the past, there used to be a lot of Cadet ships. And there's they're still Cadet ships now. But at least it gives students the option of knowing that they might have an interview, and they can let the cadetship organization organizations No. And then the second round, of course, is only for those people who have not yet applied and want more time to write their application.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  57:00
Excellent, fantastic. So again, do we if we apply in October instead of May, are we at a disadvantage? Absolutely not. Briana, did you apply in round one or round two?
 
57:16
I believe that I did round one look my memories a bit off. But I was pretty set on trying to get it in as early as I could. So I think it was round one. But to be totally honest, it's not something that gets taken into consideration. They're not going to judge you. Like I've not heard Michelle, tell anyone all you around to obviously what happens at it. Why are you hesitating? But no. Round One, round two doesn't really matter which one, it's just mainly out of consideration for you and your time, especially with HSE being in the later months of the year.
 
Rachel - UTS Business School  57:56
Absolutely. I mean, we have to application rounds, genuinely for a reason one of them isn't like a trick or a way of trying to test motivation or anything, they are legitimately exactly the same in terms of intake as well. Now, one question that is a really, really good one. How does the actual scholarship component of the coursework, Michelle, in terms of how is the funding broken up? And how is that allocated?
 
Michelle Cook  58:27
So students will receive that scholarship every fortnight on a Wednesday 10am I just thought I'd let you know about that, because people get excited about that. And that is a tax free scholarship that will come straight to the students. So it goes to the bank account, your own bank account, students asked me, you know, how can they use that money, they can use it in any way they prefer. So it doesn't necessarily have to go to a fee paying, etc, etc. It depends on what they need would need to use that money for. So it's every fortnight or Wednesday at 10am and that gets paid from UTS straight into the successful candidates a bank account.

All students in the course receive a tax-free scholarship worth up to $54,000. Learn more about the scholarship.
The Bachelor of Accounting has been designed as a joint venture between UTS Business School and Australia’s premier business employers, to specifically address the needs of the industry. Learn more about our sponsor organisations."
https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/business-courses/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-accounting/career-prospects,"Accounting in general can offer one of the best career paths available to young Australians, in terms of long-term employment prospects, financial reward, satisfaction and challenge, overseas recognition of qualifications and opportunities to work abroad.
The Bachelor of Accounting in particular is one of Australia's most highly-regarded business degrees. The accredited accounting qualifications, plus a year of specialised work training and studies in related business disciplines, make our graduates highly employable in a large number of sectors. Graduates with a strong focus on accounting take on a wide range of roles within the industry, because the skills and knowledge acquired during their education are highly versatile.
 
Some common accounting roles:
Other roles in business open to accounting graduates:
 
Our graduate employment rate for the Bachelor of Accounting is exceptionally high. Business managers consistently rate accounting as the most important business subject to learn. Graduates with an accounting qualification are better able to understand the workings of business and able to make the better decisions. Increasingly, accountants are themselves becoming the decision-makers."
https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/business-courses/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-accounting/program-sponsors,"There are many reasons why organisations sponsor our Bachelor of Accounting program. 
Some of the benefits your company could gain from partnering with us are:
To find out more on how you can get involved in the program and recruit our best and brightest, see the information for sponsors."
https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/business-courses/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-accounting/full-time-work-training,"Students in the Bachelor of Accounting program spend only 2 out of their 3 years attending classes at university. The other year is made up of full-time work training with one of the many sponsor organisations. This year is split into two separate half-years or semesters, to allow each student to experience two different business environments. Internship 1 is in the second half of the first year of the course; Internship 2 is in the first half of the final year of the course.
During the first Internship students complete para-professional assignments within different accounting functions. As a first-year student you don't have a lot of learning behind you, but you stand to gain a great deal from your first exposure to the world of big business. The exact nature of your work experience will naturally vary depending on the type of organisation you work for - whether it be insurance, banking, manufacturing, communications, government or retail.
As a third-year student, in the second Internship, you can expect to be working on higher level accounting projects. Sponsor organisations will often have a special job or project in mind which they can hand to a Bachelor of Accounting student, particularly as this fits in with one of the major assignments to be completed for their final year subjects. Large tasks like this are a great challenge to an undergraduate student, and this is your chance to make a real contribution to the management of a large and well-known organisation.
 
Students are asked to nominate their preferred placement for an upcoming Internship. Placements are allocated by UTS based on the best fit of student to organisation, taking into account student interest and performance and the corporate environment and particular work experience offered by each sponsor.
Sponsors are asked to plan a schedule of appropriate work training for each student placed within their organisation. This may involve a rotation around different departments and/or a rotation around different work assignments within the one division. The key is planning, so that the student gets a wide variety of business experience within each 6-month placement.
Students typically work 9-to-5, Monday-to-Friday for the duration of the Internship, although flexible arrangements are common to accommodate periods of high activity. An orientation / introduction to the organisation and its expected standards is provided when a student first reports for work at the start of the Internship.
Most of our current sponsors have their head offices in the CBD, with others at North Sydney, Northmead and Sydney Olympic Park. This is where students will spend much of their time during the Internship, although in many cases sponsors will try to give students some experience outside of head office at other offices or plants.
Students continue to study during the Internship, typically on one major work-integrated project and one subject studied one evening a week. The work of students in the project subjects is directly related to the work they are performing for their sponsors, and aims to add real value to those organisations involved. During their first Internship, students are given a half-day of study leave each week in order to work on these university subjects.
At the end of the Internship sponsor supervisor(s) are asked to submit a formal evaluation of the student, and each student is asked to report on their experiences during the Internship. This feedback is an important part of the continuing development and improvement of the Internships.
An important point to note is that most of our sponsors have a continual student presence at their workplace; as soon as one Internship is finished, another student (from a different year) will be starting the next Internship. This means that Bachelor of Accounting students are relied on as a permanent source of accounting talent, able to fill in for absent employees or fill a permanent student trainee role in the organisation."
https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/business-courses/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-accounting/scholarship-and-selection,"The Bachelor of Accounting is only open to citizens and permanent residents of Australia, and is intended for school leavers, meaning applicants who are currently in Year 12 or only one or two years out of school are those sought by the employers who sponsor the course.  Applicants more than a few years out of school are less likely to be selected - based on our selection criteria - but are still eligible to apply. All applicants must note that the course starts with compulsory fast-track classes 6 weeks before most other university courses.
Entry to the Bachelor of Accounting is very competitive and is not based on ATAR score alone. Selection criteria are as follows:
You do not have to study Economics or Business Studies at school in order to qualify for selection. Mathematics (to Advanced level) is assumed knowledge, however it is not a prerequisite for the course (though students who have not completed Advanced Mathematics may wish to complete a bridging course or similar in order to prepare for the content of the degree.)
There is no fixed ATAR requirement for the Bachelor of Accounting. Like all of our selection criteria, the better your score for academic ability the better your chances of being selected.  Each year we take in students with ATARs ranging from 90 to 100, balancing criteria against one another so that if you excel particularly in another area it can compensate for a lower academic score, and vice versa.
In 2023 students in the Bachelor of Accounting program will receive a scholarship valued at:
In addition to the scholarship, which runs for 2.5 years of the 3-year course, students can claim a Recruitment Incentive of $9,000 in their third year if recruited by a sponsor organisation (see below). 
The scholarship is paid in fortnightly instalments into a nominated bank account, throughout the calendar year, through both university and practical experience semesters. The scholarship is paid to students by the university from pooled sponsorship funds, and is clearly not tied to any particular sponsor organisation. As such it is tax-exempt income. Students are not obliged to join any particular firm upon graduation, nor do they have to repay any of the scholarship if they do not accept a job offer from a sponsor. Receipt of the scholarship is subject to the disciplinary rules of the Bachelor of Accounting program.
In addition to the scholarship payments above, any student who has to move home in order to join the course in Sydney will receive a Relocation Allowance.
The Bachelor of Accounting student scholarship terminates on June 30 in the third year of the program. However, by this time most (if not all) Bachelor of Accounting students will have been recruited for full-time employment starting the following year. Those students who receive and accept a job offer from any of our sponsor organisations will be rewarded with a Recruitment Incentive of $9,000 (i.e. equivalent to the value of a scholarship for the remaining 6 months of the course).
To claim their entitlement to the Recruitment Incentive students must lodge with the Office of Co-operative Education an ""Acceptance of Offer of Employment"" form, signed by the student and a sponsor representative, setting out the terms of the employment agreement. In the event that the student does not commence employment as agreed, the Recruitment Incentive must be repaid."

A qualified Early Childhood Teacher and Diploma-trained staff member will plan and deliver, with the assistance of skilled and experienced childcare workers, the educational program that will foster your child’s learning, communication skills and social relationships with others. 
Our environment plays a large role in guiding children’s learning by offering choice, independence and freedom in exploring natural materials and settings. Children develop self-esteem, self-expression, confidence and social competence through play.   
UTS Child Care Centres operate with an excellent ratio of children to staff that exceeds minimum legislated requirements. This assists staff in the delivery of the high quality education and care program. We provide our staff with opportunities for ongoing professional training and development, as well as study leave, to assist them in gaining further Early Childhood qualifications.
Parents play an important role in the service and their involvement is encouraged.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/study-abroad-and-exchange-students-old/academic-information,"You can choose from a wide range of subjects when you do a study abroad or exchange program. 
Please note the next application round is for UTS Autumn 2024 (February - June 2024). For deadlines see key dates
As a study abroad or exchange student, you can choose undergraduate subjects (Bachelor's degree level) and postgraduate subjects (Master's degree level) from most study areas at UTS. You can find subjects in three ways:
Many subjects at UTS are ‘pre-approved’ for study abroad and exchange students. This means that: 
A full list can be found on our pre-approved subject list page.
Please note that undergraduate students are not normally permitted to study postgraduate subjects. Postgraduate students may need to seek approval to enrol into undergraduate subjects.
If you can’t find what you are looking for in the pre-approved subject list, take a look at our faculty Subject Guides. They’re an easy way to find information about our most popular subjects. If you choose a subject that is not pre-approved, you will have to:
You can also search the UTS Handbook for all subjects and majors or visit your preferred faculty on the UTS website. The video below will help you understand how to use the UTS Handbook.
If you are looking to research the subjects available at UTS, we would recommend starting first with the Study Abroad and Exchange subject guides which can be found on our webpage under subjects and academic information. Please refer to our video on the subject guides more information on how to use these.
Once you’ve watched the subject guides video, it is time to learn about the UTS Handbook. The UTS Handbook is an essential tool that you will want to become familiar with. This is because the handbook lists the subjects available at UTS, and gives you detailed descriptions for each subject.
So, how do you use the UTS Handbook?
The handbook is an online resource, so the first step is to navigate to the appropriate website. You will need to search the term UTS Handbook within your preferred search engine, or alternatively you can go directly to the website by typing in handbook.uts.edu.au in the address bar.
Now we are at the front page of the UTS Handbook. On the first page, you will see a list of the different disciplines offered at UTS, also known as course areas. 
If you are trying to study subjects at UTS that are similar to the ones you might take for your degree at your home university, then we recommend that you first click on the discipline that corresponds with the discipline that you study at home. For example, if you study a Bachelor of Marketing at your home university, you will want to click on Business.
Once you click on the right discipline, you can either click on this subject link here to see a full list of subjects related to that discipline, or you can click on courses that are related to that discipline by clicking undergraduate courses or postgraduate courses.
We recommend that you click on either undergraduate courses or postgraduate courses, whichever are relevant to you, because if you click on this subject link here you will get a full list of both postgraduate and undergraduate subjects. This can be confusing, and not all subjects may be appropriate for what you study.
If you click on undergraduate or postgraduate courses, you will be directed to a page that has a full list of the courses that undergraduate or postgraduate students can study within that discipline. We recommend that you click the course that is most similar to what you study at home. This may take some trial and error, as UTS may not label the degree the exact same way. For example, you may study a Bachelor of Marketing at home, but there is no Bachelor of Marketing at UTS. In this case, you should click on the different courses to find something similar. The course you study at home may not be a full degree at UTS, but it may be a stream or major within another degree. For example, if you study a Bachelor of Marketing, you will find that if you click Bachelor of Business and then go to the course program section, that marketing is listed as one of the majors you can take within the Bachelor of Business.
Each course page is structured a little bit differently, but essentially within the course page you will be able to find subjects that are related to that course by clicking on different links. For example, if I want to study marketing related subjects, I can navigate to the marketing submajor section on this page, and I will see a list of marketing subjects.
You can also find subjects related to a particular major or submajor, such as marketing, by going to the side of the handbook and clicking study package directory. After you click on study package directory, you can click on major or submajor and see an alphabetical list of the majors and subjmajors offered at UTS.
Once you are on a page that lists subjects, such as this one, you can click on the number next to the subject and you will be directed to the subject information.
Once you are on a subject information page, you should pay attention to the requisites. If you see requisites listed, it means that you will need to have studied that requisite or something very similar at your home university in order to take this subject at UTS.
You will also notice a section on the subject pages called “access conditions” – don’t worry about those, as they don’t apply to study abroad and exchange students. It’s just the requisites that you’ll want to pay attention to.
If there are lots of requisites next to a subject, that means that it requires a lot of prior knowledge in order to take the subject and is probably an advanced subject. If there are no requisites listed, then the subject is most likely an entry level subject that doesn’t require background knowledge.
Another thing to notice on the subject page is whether it says the subject is an undergraduate or postgraduate subject. Undergraduate students can’t take postgraduate subjects, so make sure you are aware of this when you are reading the subject page.
You should also look at the number of UTS credits a subject is. Most subjects at UTS are worth 6cps but Arts and Social Science subjects and Law subjects tend to be 8 credit points. When you are a student at UTS the minimum number of credits you can take is 18, and the maximum is 26 credit points. The usual full load at UTS is 24 credit points. You may need to take a mix of 6 and 8 credit point subjects. For information about converting UTS credits to other credit systems, take a look at the subjects and academic information page of the UTS Study Abroad and Exchange Website.
If you want to find out when a subject is offered, the subject page may or may not list this information. Even it does, it is always best to use the timetable planner website to double check when a subject is running.  
For detailed information about a subject including the structure of the subject, you can click on the link called detailed subject description. While the main subject page gives you a brief overview of the subject, the detailed subject description is what you will want to take to your home university if they need information about the subject you would like to study at UTS.
Finally, if you would like to study electives at UTS that are not related to your degree, we recommend that you start researching these by checking out the electives subject guide. If this doesn’t list what you are looking for then you can go back to the main page of the UTS Handbook and click on any course area you are interested in, and search for subjects within that course area. An exception to this is for education – only students who study education at their home university should study education at UTS, because education subjects use a different academic calendar than most other subjects. This can be confusing, so as a rule we recommend that if you don’t study education at your home university, do not study education at UTS. And if you do study education at your home university and need to take education subjects at UTS, only pick education subjects and don’t try and cross disciplines. 
Thank you for watching this video, we hope it has been a useful introduction to the UTS Handbook and how to use it.
Most subjects are taught in the main calendar, which is divided into two sessions: Autumn (February-June) and Spring (July-November).
However, undergraduate and postgraduate subjects in Education are taught in Calendar D. These subjects run at slightly different times to the main calendar subjects. You are not permitted to enrol in subjects that run on different calendars, i.e. ALL your subjects must be taught in the main calendar, or otherwise ALL your subjects must be taught in Calendar D.
More information about UTS teaching sessions are available in the Principal Dates section of the UTS Handbook.
The UTS Timetable Planner allows students to see when subjects are running, and is a useful tool for Study Abroad and Exchange students when researching the subjects they might want to take at UTS. The UTS timetable is released in October every year for the following year. 
Watch the video below to learn how to use the UTS Timetable Planner.
The UTS Timetable Planner is a tool that allows students to view subject timetables and plan out their schedules. As such, it is a useful resource for Study Abroad and Exchange students who are researching the subjects they might want to take at UTS. Other useful tools to help you with this process are the Study Abroad and Exchange Subject Guides and the UTS Handbook. If you haven’t already watch our videos on these topics, we recommend that you watch them first and then come back to this video later.
Now, what is the timetable planner, and how do you use it? The timetable planner is a tool that allows you to search the subjects that you are interested in, and find out when these subjects and their classes are running.
In order to get to the timetable planner, simply type the term “UTS Timetable Planner” into your preferred web browser. Click on the first site that comes up, and then click on the button that says “View the UTS Timetable Planner”. Once you are at this webpage, you will notice that there is a search bar. To use this search bar, simply type in the subject code of the subject you are interested in, and press search. Once you do this, the subject will populate on the left hand side of the page, under “selected subjects”. The subject will be listed with the subject code first, followed by a string of letters and numbers. In order to effectively use the timetable planner to plan out your prospective schedule, you need to understand what these letters and numbers mean.
So, how do you figure this out? If you navigate to the top right corner of the timetable planner, you will see there is a button called “help”. If you click on the help button, you will be directed to a guide which explains what the symbols we looked at before mean. In this video, I’ll walk you through the most relevant codes for Study Abroad and Exchange Students.
The first code you will need to become familiar with is the session code. If a subject number has “AUT” listed after it, this means that it is taught in the Australian Autumn. If a subject number has “SPR” after it, it is taught in the Australian Spring. As a Study Abroad or Exchange student, you will need to take subjects that run in either Autumn or Spring, depending on when you will be studying at UTS. The seasons are different in the Northern Hemisphere, so make sure you keep that in mind. Autumn session at UTS is between February and June, and Spring session at UTS is between August and December.
The next code you will want to be aware of when using the timetable planner is the campus code. As a Study Abroad or Exchange Student, you want to take subjects at either Ultimo or Moore Park, and not anywhere else. Ultimo is where most classes at UTS are located, and Moore Park is a well connected 30 minutes away by light rail. When you are using the timetable planner, you want to make sure that there is either a “U” for Ultimo or a “MP” for “Moore Park” after the session code. You will need to take subjects at either of these campuses, and remember to factor in travel time when thinking about your potential schedule.
The next code to be aware of is the study attendance mode code. “S” after the campus code means that the subject has a standard attendance mode. “B” after the campus code means that the subject is taught in block mode. Most subjects will be taught in standard mode, so if
you are considering a subject that is in block mode please contact the Study Abroad and Exchange team for further information.
Now that you understand how to read a subject listing, let’s go back to the timetable planner. In order to plan out your prospective schedule, type the codes of the subjects that you are interested in into the search bar, and then select on the left hand side the subject that is right for you. For example, let’s pretend that I want to study law subjects at UTS in Spring.
First I am going to type in the code of a subject (70617), and then out of the options presented on the left hand side, tick the subject that contains “SPR” for Spring. I do not want to tick the subject that contains AUT, as I will not be at UTS in Autumn. Once I’ve ticked my first subject, I will put in the code for the other subject that I am interested in (70104). I’ll then select on the left hand side the Spring offering. It is important to note that sometimes when you search for a subject, only one offering is presented, and it may not be for the session that you are interested in. For example, if I type in the subject number 79015, I can see that the subject 79015 is only offered in Autumn. Because I will be studying at UTS in Spring and not in Autumn, I need to consider a different subject.
Another thing to note when searching in the timetable planner is that sometimes when you input a subject code from the handbook into the search bar, nothing comes up. This means that the subject is not being offered, and will not become available during that academic year. The Timetable Planner is only updated once a year in October, and once released is final.
Once you have selected subjects that are running in the appropriate session and campus, you can click “Show Timetable” to see the schedule for those subjects. The timetable that pops up may look a little bit intimidating, but don’t worry too much – the timetable shows all the times that activities for a subject are running, and you won’t need to attend all of these times.
To get a clearer view of the timetable, you can either click the “show as list” button on the right hand side, or you can click the “download this timetable” button next to the print symbol. For the purposes of this video, I’m going to click the “download this timetable” button.
Once you click the “download this timetable” button, an excel file will generate. The excel file lists all of the possible times that the subjects you have selected are running, including times for the different activities.
Lets look at subject 70617 first. If you look at the “Group” column, you can see that this subject has both lectures and tutorials. This is standard for UTS, however some subjects may have different formats such as computer labs or studios. To understand what the different codes in this column mean, go back to the “Help” section of the timetable planner and scroll to the bottom. Under the activities section, you will see a key to the different codes.
Once you understand these codes, you can go back to your excel spreadsheet.
Because you are only researching subjects, at this stage the most important thing to keep in mind is that you won’t be able to participate in subjects that have clashing lecture times. If lecture times do clash, you will need to consider a different subject.
In order to figure out if lecture times will clash, I recommend looking at the group column, and highlighting all rows that include “l-e-c”. For each subject, you will need to go to one activity for each lecture.
Let’s look at my first subject, subject 70617, as an example. This subject has five lecture groups; lecture one, two, three, four, and five. Because each of these groups say activity one next to them, you will need to attend all of these lecture groups.
Now let’s look at a different subject, subject 70104. We can see that for this subject there are two lecture ones, and one lecture two. For lecture one, you will only need to attend one of these times. For lecture two, there is only one time option, so you will need to attend that option.
Once you understand how many lecture groups and activities a subject has, you can plan out a prospective schedule by checking to make sure subjects don’t have lectures at the same time. To figure this out, you will want to look in the columns called “day”, “time”, “duration”, and “date”. If subjects do have lectures that are running at the same time, you will need to reconsider subject choices, because lectures are mandatory and you won’t be able to attend clashing lectures.
In regards to tutorials and other activities, don’t worry about these too much right now. For now, the most important thing to consider is lectures and making sure they don’t clash.
As mentioned, if subjects do have lecture times that clash, you won’t be able to take both subjects. To find a new subject, you can either enter a specific code into the UTS timetable planner like before, and then see when that subject runs, or you can use the advanced filters to find any subject that suits your prospective timetable. Simply input your preferences into the advanced filter, and then select the day and time that suits your schedule, and press search. On the left hand side you will see all courses that meet those parameters. It is important to note that even though these subjects may be at the right time, they may not be suitable for you in terms of course level and prerequisites. Always make sure you read through the UTS Handbook and talk to your home university before making any subject choices.
We hope that you have enjoyed this video about the UTS Timetable planner, and that you now have a better idea of how to start planning your possible schedule. As a reminder, the UTS timetable planner should be used as a guide only, as it is possible that classes will fill or certain times won’t be available during the session you are studying at UTS. Once you are enrolled at UTS, you will be able to make more concrete decisions related to your schedule.
Study Abroad and Exchange students must enrol in a full-time load at UTS. The full-time study load is 18-24 credit points per session. Credit points apply to all subjects and represent a measure of the student workload by subject. Most subjects at UTS are 6 credit points each, but some may carry different credit point values. Be mindful of this when choosing your subjects.
Refer to the UTS Handbook for information about subjects at UTS.
Generally, Study Abroad and Exchange students enrol in three or four subjects per session at UTS.

Most UTS subjects are taught through a mix of lectures and tutorials. Some subjects incorporate seminars, presentations, laboratory work and/or individual study. One subject at UTS, which may include lectures, tutorials, seminars, self-study and laboratory sessions, usually totals between 12 and 24 hours per week.
Information on coursework assessment for each subject is provided at the beginning of each session. Written assignments, tutorial participation, practical work, group work, projects, short tests or seminar presentations may all form part of the assessment. In some subjects, the final examination may be worth 20 to 60 per cent of the final subject grade. Some subjects have no final examinations.
Important note: Some subjects award only a Pass or Fail and a grade or mark will not be provided.
UTS automatically issues transcripts at the end of each session for study abroad and exchange students. The transcript is a record of subjects studied, final grades and marks awarded.
Once you complete your program, you can view your results and download an unofficial transcript via My Student Admin (MSA). A free copy of the official UTS transcript will then be issued via the My eQuals platform.
Students who do not wish to be issued with a digital transcript can opt out of My eQuals and will receive a hard copy instead. Students can also purchase hard copy transcripts if required.
UTS Study Abroad program students will also be issued with a digital Certificate of Completion and an Excellence Award Certificate (if applicable).

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/design-architecture-and-building/essential-information/attendance-patterns,"The number of days on-campus (face-to-face hours) varies depending on your study mode, year of study and timetable requirements.
Full time students undertake four subjects each session, while part-time study is most commonly undertaken at two subjects per session.
In addition to hours on campus, you need to allow time for assignment preparation and self-directed study. As a general rule, for every hour of face-to-face teaching, you should allow one to two hours of self-directed study.
Full-time course work study consists of four subjects each session while part-time study is most commonly undertaken at two subjects per session.
The way that subjects are offered varies between courses, including frequency, length and time of classes.
We cater for busy lifestyles by offering after-hours classes, part-time study or intensive block mode to enable you to have an enriching experience with us.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/design-architecture-and-building/essential-information/application-info-and-costs,"The cost of study is dependent upon a student’s choice of course, subjects and electives. Courses in which the outcomes are creative (such as Architecture and Design) will require students to cover the costs of the visualisation and prototyping of their projects from idea to realisation.
Most outcomes will be dependent upon the student’s own creative response, so material requirements and costs will vary.
Typical costs might include the cost of developing models and prototypes, laser cutting, rapid prototyping, textiles, garments and printing. The cost of project realisation will generally increase for Design students undertaking an honours year and the production of a major project.
Postgraduate students undertaking study in Design or Architecture may need to plan for costs, depending upon the focus of their projects.
Additional study costs can also include the purchase of books, computer equipment, a camera, local field trips and optional overseas study trips. This will depend upon the student’s course of study.
Some materials can be bought at a reduced price through the faculty workshop or through the UTS Student Union shop.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/commencing-students/getting-student-visa,"Learn how to obtain a Subclass 500 visa in order to study at UTS.
You will need to obtain a student visa to study in Australia unless you hold another type of visa that permits you to study. It can take several weeks for your visa application to be processed, so it is important to begin the application process as soon as you receive your offer from UTS.
If you are applying to UTS through a UTS representative, they will help you prepare your student visa application.
If you are applying directly to UTS, refer to the Department of Home Affairs guide on how to apply for a student visa (opens an external site). If you have questions about the application, contact your nearest Australian immigration office (opens an external site).
Below you will find important information which will help you understand student visas in Australia.  Remember, it's your responsibility as the visa applicant or holder to be aware of the conditions and requirements of your student visa (opens an external site). 
After you have accepted your offer at UTS, we will send you a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE). You will need your CoE to apply for your student visa. Contact the International Student Centre if you need another copy of your CoE.
If you have not yet accepted your offer, visit our page on accepting your offer for instructions. The information on the current page is only relevant for students who have accepted their offer.
The Department of Home Affairs has a simplified student visa framework (SSVF) (opens external website) in place that applies to all international students.
UTS is an approved SSVF provider and recruits students into its degree courses under the SSVF arrangements of the Department of Home Affairs. SSVF enables students to obtain their student visa quickly and usually with less documentation required.
International students apply for a single student visa (subclass 500) regardless of their chosen course of study. When you are granted a visa under SSVF you must continue to maintain enrolment in an eligible course, and continue to have sufficient financial capacity to support your study and stay in Australia.
All student visa (subclass 500) holders must maintain enrolment at the same level or a higher Australian Qualification Framework (AQF) level for which they were granted a visa, unless they are undertaking a doctoral degree (AQF10) and transfer to a master’s degree (AQF9). Transferring to a lower AQF level course or transferring from an AQF level course to a non-AQF Award course is a breach of the student visa condition and might result in the visa being cancelled.  If you want to change to a lower AQF level course or a non-AQF course, you will need a new student visa.
To learn more about student visas in Australia, visit the Department of Home Affairs website.
Student visa applicants who apply in countries included in the offshore biometric program (opens external site) will be required to provide biometric identifiers (fingerprints and facial images). Biometrics are collected at an Australian Visa Application Centre (AVAC) or an Australian Biometrics Collection Centre (ABCC) (opens external site). You will be notified by the Department of Home Affairs if you need to provide biometrics.
Students under the age of 18 must:
Live with their parent or legal guardian or with a suitable relative whom the parent or legal guardian nominates (subject to approval by the Department of Home Affairs); or
Live in accommodation and welfare arrangements approved by the university. You can find more information on the Welfare arrangements for students under 18 page.
In order for the Department of Home Affairs to process your visa application, you must show evidence that you have one of the above living arrangements in place.
If you are under 18 when you apply for a visa but turn 18 before you arrive in Australia you must contact the Department of Home Affairs to seek advice on the appropriate forms required.
If your student visa is going to expire before you complete your studies, you will need to apply for a new student visa.
It is very important that you apply for a new visa as soon as possible. It is your responsibility to be aware of your visa expiry date and to apply for a new one in time.
If you are applying for a new student visa because you are extending your current course, you must first apply for a new CoE. To do this, you need to complete the online CoE request form at least two months before your current visa expires. This process is not automatic—you must satisfy certain conditions to be able to extend your course.
For further information on applying for a new student visa please read the information about subclass 500 student visa (opens an external site). Click on the 'Step by step' tab where you will find information about how to submit a new student visa application.
Students with families who wish to bring their dependants with them to Australia will need to arrange entry through the Department of Home Affairs. Find out if you’re eligible to bring dependants to Australia by reading the Bringing Family webpage (opens an external site) of the Department of Home Affairs website.
If parents, siblings and friends wish to visit you in Australia, they can apply for a short stay (visitor) visa. Information about visitor visas (opens an external site) can also be found on the Department of Home Affairs website.
If you are bringing school-aged dependants to Australia, you will normally be required to pay full fees if they are enrolled in either a government or non-government school.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/commencing-students/arriving-and-settling,"Joining us at UTS? Congratulations! Here are some tips to make sure your first few weeks in Sydney go smoothly.
As UTS has always done throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to monitor and follow government guidelines and health advice.
Please refer to the Department of Home Affairs website for the latest information regarding COVID-19 testing requirements and approved COVID-19 testing evidence for entering Australia.
Congratulations on receiving an offer to study at UTS!
After much anticipation, you’ll be travelling to Sydney soon. You might be excited or nervous, or something in between. But fear not, we are here to guide you through all the steps for your arrival in Sydney!
First, find out what documentation you will need to enter Australia. You can find the list of requirements on the Department of Home Affairs website. This will include evidence of your COVID vaccination status.
Be mindful that the requirements to enter Australia are always changing, so always check the Department of Home Affairs website for the most up-to-date arrival information.
After you get off the plane, you will go through customs: make sure you have your passport and incoming passenger form ready!
Collect your baggage and proceed to quarantine inspection.
During your flight, you will receive a list of items that you will need to declare, such as certain foods that you might have with you.
If you fail to declare them, you risk getting fined or prosecuted.
Don’t be sorry, just declare it!
Don't be surprised if a dog and its handler approach you in the airport. They are checking people's luggage for prohibited items. The dogs are friendly, but just make sure you don't pat them while they are working!
You can take a train, bus, taxi, or a rideshare - like Uber.
Download a public transport app to learn how to get around, especially if you’ve arranged accommodation outside the city centre.
To take public transport in Sydney, you can use your credit or debit card. Simply tap your card when you’re getting on and off - and you’re good to go!
Alternatively, you can get an Opal card. This is Sydney’s official public transport card. You can get these in convenience stores, news agents, or train stations around Sydney. 
Once you’re settled in, don’t forget to let your embassy know you’ve arrived.
Visit your country’s embassy or consulate website to register yourself as a person living overseas in their jurisdiction – this will be useful later if you need to renew your passport or vote while you’re still in Sydney.
Next, you can start preparing for your first day at UTS!
You can view your class times and locations in MyTimetable.
Make sure you log in to UTS Canvas before your first class. Your subject coordinator will post all your subject resources and information on UTS Canvas, so make sure you spend some time exploring it.
There is a lot to learn when you first move to a new country.
Make sure you register for the UTS Essential Advice for International Students session. You will learn all about settling -in in Sydney and at UTS, including tips on staying safe and managing your health and wellbeing - linked in description.
We wish you all the best at UTS!
The Australian government has strict rules about what you can and cannot bring (opens external site) into Australia. Check these rules before you depart, and never carry any prohibited materials for anyone else.
There are severe penalties for bringing prohibited materials into Australia, which may affect your freedom to travel to and study in other countries.
During your flight to Australia, you will be given an incoming passenger card (opens external site). This is a short form where you must write your name, intended address, reason for travelling, and other details. You must also state whether you are carrying any goods that are restricted or prohibited in Australia.
Complete this on the plane before disembarking. When you land, an Immigration Officer will check your passport and incoming passenger card. You will then go to the baggage claim area to collect your luggage.
If you have stated that you have goods to declare, you may have your bags inspected by a Customs Officer. However, your bags may be inspected even if you do not declare anything. If a Customs Officer finds an item that you failed to declare, you may be fined and the item may be confiscated. If you are unsure of whether you can bring an item into Australia, always declare it.
When you arrive in Sydney, visit the International Student Welcome Desk in the International Arrivals terminal. Staffed by international student volunteers, this friendly service welcomes thousands of commencing students to NSW each year.
You can take the train from Sydney Airport directly to the city for around A$19. You will need to purchase an Adult Opal single trip ticket or an Opal card from select Sydney airport retailers (opens an external site). Opal is the ticketing system used for the entire Sydney transport network. To learn more, visit our Transport in Sydney page.
You can check the train times and fares on the Trip Planner page (opens an external site). From Central Station, it’s a ten minute walk to the UTS campus. Most Sydney train lines connect at Central Station.
Alternatively, you can take a taxi, however they tend to be more expensive than public transport. If you are staying at a hotel for your first few nights, your hotel may run mini buses from the airport.
The UTS Housing service can assist with arranging suitable on-campus or off-campus accommodation. Due to the high demand for UTS housing we recommend that you apply as soon as possible.  
If you require short-term accommodation there are other options such as hostels around UTS. You can also visit UTS Housing in Building 6, level 2 for more information about living and renting in Sydney.
It is a good idea to have sufficient funds ready for the first few weeks of your stay. You can exchange currency at the airport, but it may be cheaper in the city or with a bank. Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) are available at Sydney Airport and throughout Sydney, and they accept most of the major cards (Mastercard, Visa etc).
UTS has 24-hour security staff patrolling at the campus. In an emergency, you can dial 6 from any campus phone or 1800 249 559 from any phone to contact campus security. Save this number in your mobile phone. You can ask for help at any time if you feel unsafe or unsure of your surroundings.
Sydney is a fairly safe city; however, you should be aware of your surroundings especially when you are out at night. Keep all your belongings in a secure place and do not leave them unattended. If you travel at night by public transport, it is best to travel with someone or stay in well-lit areas when waiting for the bus, train or ferry.
If there is an emergency and you need to contact the Police, Ambulance or Fire Department call 000 any time of the day or night. You can call this number from any phone, free of charge. For any other police matters within Sydney City, contact the relevant Police Area Command (PAC).
While you make the most of your time in Sydney, trying new activities and experiences, it’s important to keep these safety tips in mind.
 Swim only between the flags on patrolled beaches. Do not swim at night, and remember to wear sunscreen!
Hi, what’s up everybody? My name’s Chris and I was a previous student at UTS, studying Bachelor of Health Science in Traditional Chinese Medicine. I also volunteered as a life-safety advisor at the Sydney airport where I was giving beach safety advice to international students who were coming to Australia for the first time.
So just a few points I want to cover for beach safety. You might want to know which beaches are appropriate to swim in, and the main way to see it is to look for the red and yellow flags; as long as you see two flags in-between, it is appropriate to swim in-between them.
The second point is that you never know what you’re going to run into at the beach. Which is why it is most important to swim with some friends and never swim alone.
So third point is try to understand the currents and the rips that occur at the beach. Whenever you get stuck in a rip or a current, always raise your arm like this and try to remain calm. Float on your back to conserve the energy against the waves and wait for the nearest lifeguards to come over to you. 
So now that we’ve got beach safety out of the way, we’re. going to cover a few points about sun safety. So even on cooler days, the sun’s UV rays are so strong, that it is able to burn our skin. 
And as always, with the most Aussie iconic phrase, slip on a t-shirt, slop on some sunscreen, slap a hat on, and don’t forget to slide some sunnies. And don’t forget to stay in the shade!
On one final point, people believe in this myth that tanning isn’t dangerous. However, tanning is a sign of UV damage that builds up over time in the skin. Which is why it is important to put on sunscreen before and after you’re swimming at the beach. 
This is why it’s important to always put on sunscreen before and after swimming.
For more information you can check out the Beach Safety app, and don’t forget to have fun!
Inform someone if you go on a hike and make sure you take a map, plenty of water, wet weather gear, warm clothes and a phone. Always walk with other people and take an emergency beacon, available from camping stores. Always inform someone of where you are going and when you intend to be back. Learn more on the NSW National Parks page (opens external site).
In Australia, it's illegal to have more than a small amount of alcohol before driving. Don’t drink and drive or get into a car with a driver who has been drinking. Get a taxi home instead.

We've spent more than $1 billion on a transformation program, and the results are stunning: iconic buildings, purpose-built spaces and technology-driven learning opportunities that are second to none. 
UTS Central, the Faculty of Law's home, opened in 2020.
[Speaker: Georgia Dixon, Bachelor of Business, Bachelor of Laws, University of Technology Sydney]
The Law faculty has recently moved from Haymarket campus to the Broadway area. It's a brand new building that's very high tech and there's lots of great places to study.
 
The Moot Court is used for all of our Mooting competitions at UTS, which is like a mock trial. It's like what you see in movies, it's the fake court scenes and researching cases in the past. There's televisions all around the room, everyone can be mic'd up and we can even do video links to people in other locations. These days a lot of video links are happening between states, or even internationally, and with cameras in these rooms, we can do exactly that.
 
There are also student breakout rooms, which are the best place to go and study, you can sit around a table with a group,and have a study group all studying together, or there are individual tables where you can have some time to yourself.
 
We also have a really nice new Winter Garden, so you can study outside as well.
 
The Trial Courts are very similar to the Moot Court, just a smaller version with a few different setups where you can also have a witness at the front and room for other people to give expert evidence.
 
If you do a UTS faculty moot you can use the preparation room. It's got special swipe card access and you can go in there and have some quiet time to prepare on a moot, practice your orals, or write your written submissions.
 
Student reception is where you can go and ask any questions if you're having some issues or contact a staff member. If you have to hand in a hard copy of an assignment, student reception is where you'd go.
 
One of the best parts about being at UTS Central is it's the same building as the library and the Reading Room.
 
There's lots of wonderful facilities that are all very high tech and a great place to be continuing my studies.
Doing a Law degree at our inner-city campus puts you right in the middle of Sydney's urban hub. Within easy walking distance to Central Station and the Sydney CBD, the UTS Haymarket campus is easily accessible by train, light rail and buses and close to industry partners. And if you drive in, you may be eligible for a student discount from one of the nearby parking stations. 
From the classroom to the courtroom. Designed to reflect the real-life courtroom experience of the NSW Supreme and District Courts, the Moot Court is regularly used by our students to develop their practical skills as an advocate and litigator, showcase mock-court scenarios to large audiences and compete in one of our many inter-varsity mooting programs.
We're not just about study. Student social spaces and activities are essential to maximising your experience. Relax between classes at one of our cafes, kiosks or comfortable lounge areas and outdoor courtyards. Or, sweat it out at our ActivateUTS Gym or Multi-Purpose Sports Hall during your breaks."

Partner Nathan Cecil says Norton White was seeking a structural engineer to provide expert testimony in relation to a matter involving significant damage to a ship and its locomotive cargo during transit.
“The case involved the complex and dynamic analysis of the relative structural integrity of the wooden supports and lashings used to stabilise and support the locomotives during shipment,” Mr Cecil said.
The Nor ton White team were happy with the outcomes of their collaboration with accessUTS, which, in addition to the provision of expert advice, also delivered key administrative support for the development and delivery of a formal report.
“accessUTS provided assistance in the identification and engagement of suitably skilled academic experts, who might otherwise be extremely difficult to identify,” Mr Cecil said.
“[They also] professionally managed the engagement and report preparation process, including much appreciated quality review and editing and formatting. [This was particularly valuable to us as] engaging experts without such organisational support comes at a higher cost to [us as] the client.”
“We were very pleased with the results.”

https://www.uts.edu.au/partners-and-community/initiatives/city-campus-master-plan/overview,"The decade-long UTS City Campus Master Plan, which began in 2008, is a once-in-a-generation vision to deliver a vibrant and engaging education precinct. Through the Master Plan, UTS is making a $1 billion-plus investment that is fundamentally changing the way we deliver teaching, learning and research.
The UTS Campus Master Plan's vision for a series of new buildings, major upgrades and improved pedestrian connections right in the heart of Sydney's southern CBD is now a reality, with the campus transformed into a hub for learning, connection and collaboration.
With work under the Master Plan substantially complete, the university is reaping the benefits of the decade-long reinvention.  A range of state-of-the-art teaching, research and industry engagement spaces support the delivery of UTS’s collaboration- and technology-based model of teaching – learning.futures – as well as our industry-focused research.
Today, the UTS campus is a destination for staff, students and visitors alike.
UTS’s vision for its campus garnered wide support from government, industry and private donors, including a $50 million Education Infrastructure Fund grant from the Federal Government for the Faculty of Engineering and IT Building and a $20 million gift by Australian-Chinese business leader Dr Chau Chak Wing – the largest private donation for a university building in Australia – for the new UTS Business School.
A revitalised Alumni Green sits at the heart of the reshaped campus. This 'green heart' formed a key part of the Campus Master Plan vision, responding to a number of key drivers within the UTS strategic plan.
The City Campus Master Plan, which was announced in May 2008 as part of UTS's 20th anniversary celebrations. Its aims – now largely met – were to :
The UTS campus developed substantially over the course of its first 20 years, spreading across several city blocks, separated by busy streets. In that time, the university’s strategic objectives also shifted. The Master Plan addressed the shortcomings that developed in those early years and strengthened our position as a leading provider of tertiary education.
Key issues addressed by the Master Plan include:
Download the City Campus Master Plan booklet or play the video below for more on the transformation of the campus, new buildings and facilities and future plans. You can also find the latest news on UTS campus development projects at our campus and community news web page."
https://www.uts.edu.au/partners-and-community/initiatives/city-campus-master-plan/planning-and-delivery,"Work began on the $1 billion-plus Campus Master Plan in 2008, with the design process getting underway in mid-2009 with the Ross Milbourne Sports Hall.
Since then, students, staff and visitors have seen the Campus Master Plan become reality as projects have been progressively completed and opened including the new Faculty of Engineering and IT Building, Science and Graduate School of Health Building and Dr Chau Chak Wing Building, among other facilities. 
Other projects are now well advanced, including the transformation of Building 2, part of UTS Central.
The Master Plan is being delivered by the university's Program Management Office (PMO).
 
The planning, design and delivery of the Campus Master Plan has been a major undertaking, delivered in accordance with UTS processes, procedures and guidelines, and guided by the university's Long Term Finance Plan. UTS has undertaken extensive consultation throughout this process, both internally with end-users of the new facilities, and externally with our neighbours, the local community and precinct partners.
The same rigor is now being applied to the design and planning of current projects."

The Faculty has a dedicated Learning Precinct which provides students with access to a collaborative learning space, study areas, and toolkits to foster authentic workplace experiences and active learning. In between classes, you can also use this space to access teachers for individual and small group support, and get your hands on reference material, plus software and hardware resources.
Bridging courses are short intensive courses designed for high school students entering tertiary study. They are for students who aren't confident with their preparation for university study, or those who may not meet the assumed knowledge requirements. Bridging courses only teach to an introductory level and may assist in narrowing the gap between high school and university studies. Subjects taught in bridging courses do not carry any credit towards your degree.
Students entering tertiary study without the recommended knowledge in a particular area should consider doing a bridging course. This includes students enrolling in courses such as engineering and information technology.
Commencing undergraduate Engineering students are required to undertake the Mathematics Readiness Survey before their first session of study. Based on the results of the survey, we will determine the most appropriate first-year mathematics subject to be undertaken.
The survey is based on HSC 2 unit Mathematics and involves mainly algebra, trigonometry and calculus. There is no expectation that students undertake any special preparation for the survey.
The survey is taken at the City campus, and students are required to register. All commencing students will be contacted by the Student Centre with information on how to take the survey once they have accepted their offer into their course."

Undertaking an Honours degree allows you to delve deeper into your area of specialty, undertaking at least one thesis subject that encourages focused research under key members of faculty in the Business School, as well as in-depth coursework with a cohort of like-minded and high-achieving students.
This opportunity allows you to take a step into UTS Business School’s world-class research community at an undergraduate level, and to develop a network among your peers and teachers that will give you an edge against competitors both in your career and in further study.
UTS Business School offers Honours degrees in accounting, finance, economics, management and marketing. Applicants must have completed a UTS Business School Bachelor degree (or an equivalent) with an overall credit average and an average mark of 70 (or equivalent for non-UTS students) in the discipline area in which the Honours degree is to be awarded.
To find out more about qualifying for this course, see admission requirements on the course pages for Bachelor of Business (Honours) and Bachelor of Management (Honours).
I have a passion for business, however it didn’t take me long to realise that so too did thousands of graduates each year. Honours offered me an opportunity to place myself in a unique position in an increasingly competitive market.
– Aislinn Bakker, Bachelor of Business (Honours) in Accounting
Prior to your application, we recommend that you discuss your proposed program with your Honours coordinators for your area of speciality.
Find out more about the application process
There are also scholarships available for students undertaking study in our Honours programs. 
I had learned that the Honours program gives students the opportunity to form contacts with potential employers through your studies for future job prospects, so I was very keen to hopefully secure a job through the networking associated with my thesis work.
The idea of being able to really sink my teeth into one large project also really appealed to me.
Your thesis has to address a gap in the current literature, and so my work is adding to the scholarly knowledge, and will actually have an impact, which is quite an exciting opportunity.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/information-technology/student-experience/student-support,"UTS provides you with a full range of support services and programs to help you balance your study, work, home, finances and personal life, and make your learning experience more rewarding and enjoyable.
Find out more about university-wide support services or check out some Faculty-specific services below.
The Peer Network is a group of local and international students who volunteer their time to help out new students. Since its foundation in 1998, the number of Peer Networkers has grown to over 350 students.
Helping new students can involve leading campus tours, staffing the Orientation helpdesk and coffee cart, mingling at official welcomes, answering questions, serving food at BBQs and more. Peer Networkers also help out at various Student Life events including the In-Fusion Festival, Sports Days, and Network Café.
Being a Peer Networker comes with a range of benefits, including training, special events, certificates and references, networking advantages and, of course, the famed t-shirt.
The Women in Engineering & IT (WiEIT) Program at UTS is a long-standing initiative designed to redress the low rate of female participation in the engineering and IT, by constructing these fields as potential options for study and career. There are many programs for female students within the Faculty, such as the Lucy Mentoring Program, High School Speakers and buddy programs, as well as regular Women in Engineering and IT events throughout the year with student and industry speakers sharing their experiences and insights.
The School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences operates the Mathematics and Science Study Centre. It provides support to all UTS undergraduate and postgraduate students studying in various introductory mathematical and quantitative areas including statistics.
The Faculty has a dedicated Learning Precinct which provides students with access to a collaborative learning space, study areas, and toolkits to foster authentic workplace experiences and active learning. In between classes, you can also use this space to access teachers for individual and small group support, and get your hands on reference material, plus software and hardware resources.
Bridging courses are short intensive courses designed for high school students entering tertiary study. They are for students who aren't confident with their preparation for university study, or those who may not meet the assumed knowledge requirements. Bridging courses only teach to an introductory level and may assist in narrowing the gap between high school and university studies. Subjects taught in bridging courses do not carry any credit towards your degree.
Students entering tertiary study without the recommended knowledge in a particular area should consider doing a bridging course."

https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/info-international-students/your-rights-and-responsibilities/uts-release-protocol,"The UTS Release Protocol is aligned with the legislative requirements of Standard 7 in the National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 made under s33(1) of the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000 (Cth). 
The Protocol also addresses UTS’s obligations under the Simplified Student Visa Framework (SSVF).
The purpose of this Protocol is to set out the guidelines and procedures that govern how UTS will assess requests by international students for a transfer to another CRICOS Registered Provider prior to the completion of the Restricted Period and the appeal procedure that applies if a student request is refused.
The Protocol applies to all UTS international students and packaged pathway students where UTS is the principal provider of their course. The Student must remain enrolled in his or her course until the release request is determined. A release application is determined once a release outcome is provided and any related appeals process is completed.
For the purposes of this Protocol, the following definitions apply:AQF means Australian Qualifications Framework.CoE means a confirmation of enrolment.CRICOS means the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students.GS means a person who satisfies the genuine student criteria and intends to obtain a successful educational outcome and has the language, educational and material background to have a reasonable chance of achieving this educational outcome.
GTE means a person who satisfies the genuine temporary entrant criterion for a student visa application as administered by the Department of Home Affairs. For further information, visit the Department of Home Affairs website (opens an external site).Guardian means a person who has responsibility for the long-term welfare of the child and has all the powers, rights and duties that are vested by law or custom in the guardian of the child. (see: Reg 1.03 of the Migration Regulations 1994)National Code means the National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 made under s33(1) of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth).Principal Course means the main course of study undertaken by a student where the student has received a CoE from UTS to undertake multiple courses. The Principal Course is the final course in a package of courses. Registered Provider means a provider approved to deliver a course to overseas students under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth).Restricted Period means the first six (6) calendar months from the date a student commences their Principal Course of study.SSVF means the simplified student visa processing framework established by the Department of Home Affairs and designed to make the process of applying for a student visa simpler to navigate for Genuine Students.  For further information, visit the Department of Home Affairs website (opens an external site).TEQSA means Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency.
Valid Letter of Offer means the following criteria are met:
a) Unconditional offer (i.e. no pending/restricted entry requirements.
b) Issued by a CRICOS registered provider for a CRICOS registered course.
c) Is of the same AQF level as the student’s original principal course. For a package of courses, the final course in that package must be of the same or higher AQF level.
d) Current and valid from the date of issue.
e) The gap of the new commencing program must meet requirements.
In accordance with the National Code, an international student who has not completed six calendar months of his or her Principal Course at UTS and who wishes to transfer to another CRICOS provider in Australia must be approved for release by UTS, unless:
a) the student is government sponsored and the government sponsor provides written support for the transfer as it considers the change to be in the student’s best interests; or
b) the course for which the student received a CoE is no longer registered on CRICOS or UTS ceases to be a Registered Provider; or
c) UTS has had a sanction imposed on its registration by TEQSA that prevents the student from continuing his or her course at UTS.
Students under the age of 18 who wish to transfer providers must apply to UTS for the release and provide written permission from their parent/ guardian. Where UTS approves the release and is the nominated welfare and accommodation provider, UTS will negotiate the transfer date for welfare arrangements with the new registered provider to ensure there is no gap. 
In addition, UTS will inform students under 18 of their visa obligation to maintain their current welfare arrangements until the transfer date, or have alternate welfare arrangements approved by the new provider or the Department of Home Affairs or return to their home country until the new approved welfare arrangements take effect.
5.1. UTS will not automatically grant a release. UTS will consider applications for transfer in the context that students may have been assessed as a GS and GTE for the purposes of obtaining a student visa under SSVF arrangements and that they have made an informed decision to undertake a course at UTS and any preliminary courses packaged with it.
5.2. UTS assumes that a student’s decision was based on the availability of extensive course and general information and that students have taken into account relevant factors including family circumstances, study and career goals, other course options within Australia, location and costs.

c) provide documentation (satisfactory to UTS) supporting the reasons for the release request;
d) if packaged with accredited pathway providers ( for example, UTS College or TAFE NSW):
i. Where a student’s study is incomplete at the pathway provider, confirm that the pathway provider has granted release.
ii. Where part of a package of courses is completed, provide a course completion letter and official academic transcript issued by the pathway provider.
e) provide a valid Letter of Offer;
f) if under the age of 18, include a copy of written approval from a parent or guardian supporting the transfer;
g) If under the age of 18 and not cared for in Australia by a parent or suitable nominated relative, provide evidence that another CRICOS Registered Provider confirms they accept responsibility for approving accommodation, support and welfare arrangements.
UTS will not commence assessment of a release application until all appropriate information, as listed above, is provided.
6.2. UTS will assess and reply to the request for a release within ten (10) working days.
6.3. There is no cost associated with applying for a release from UTS.
6.4. The student must remain enrolled in his or her course until the final decision is determined. A final decision is determined once a release outcome is provided to the student and any related appeals process is completed.
UTS may grant a release where it is satisfied, in its absolute discretion that continuing the course at UTS is not in the student’s best academic interest or there are special circumstances in favour of the student moving to another provider including but not limited to:
a) the student had a conditional offer from UTS and in spite of the student’s best endeavours the student did not meet its conditions; or
b) misadventure, or other compelling or compassionate grounds (e.g. events beyond the student’s control which would have an adverse impact on their ability to continue); or
c) protracted political or civil events or a natural catastrophe in their home country, the effects of which prevent full payment of fees; or

f) there is evidence that the student’s reasonable expectations about their current course are not being met; or
g) there is documented evidence that the student was misled by UTS or an UTS authorised agent regarding UTS or its course and therefore the course is unsuitable to their needs and/or study objectives; or
h) an appeal (internal or external) on another matter results in a decision or recommendation to release the student.
UTS may, in its absolute discretion, refuse a student’s transfer request. Reasonable grounds for refusal include but are not limited to:
a) the request for transfer is made where a student has not commenced study; or
b) if under the age of 18, the student has not provided a copy of written approval from a parent or guardian supporting the transfer; or
c) if under the age of 18 and not cared for in Australia by a parent or suitable nominated relative, has not provided evidence that another CRICOS Registered Provider confirms they accept responsibility for approving accommodation, support and welfare arrangements; or
d) the student has a packaged conditional offer and the request is not supported by the pathway provider; or
e) if government sponsored, the government sponsor has not provided written support for the transfer; or
f) failure to provide a complete application as required under clause 6.1 of this Protocol; or
g) the student’s actions have caused UTS to form the view that the student is not a GS or GTE (e.g. absence from orientation events, low attendance rate, failure to access support services, radical change in academic direction); or
h) the student has been excluded or suspended from their course or has outstanding debts or fines with UTS; or
i) UTS has formed the view that the student is trying to avoid being reported to the Department of Home Affairs for failure to meet UTS’s attendance or academic progress requirements; or
j) the student applies to transfer from a UTS course/package to a course/package that is at a lower AQF level for which the original visa was issued; or
k) there are reasonable grounds for UTS forming the view that the student is trying to manipulate the SSVF system; or
l) there are reasonable grounds for UTS forming the view that the transfer will be detrimental to the student’s welfare or future studies (e.g. transfer may jeopardise the student’s progression through a package of courses); or
m) the student has not utilised the full range of support services available at UTS and/ or a UTS pathway provider to assist with academic and personal issues; or
n) change of mind, claims of financial hardship, transferring to another provider with lower tuition fees; or
o) the student is not genuinely engaging with an intervention strategy with the intention of failing and being released.Note: UTS reserves the right to take into consideration other factors, including the individual circumstances of a student, which may not have been specified above.
9.1. If UTS refuses a student’s request for a release, it will provide the student with a written explanation setting out the reasons why the request was refused and the process to appeal the decision.
9.2. If UTS grants a release, the student will be advised to contact the Department of Home Affairs to ascertain whether a new student visa is required. 
9.3. If UTS grants a release, the student’s UTS CoE will be cancelled and the student must withdraw from their UTS course.
9.4. If the student is applying for a refund, the student must do so in accordance with the Refund Protocol.     
10.1. If UTS refuses a request for release, the student has a right of appeal against UTS’s decision in accordance with Standard 10 of the National Code.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/learning.futures/how-our-students-learn,"While the UTS Model of Learning guides what our students learn, the learning.futures strategy is all about how our students learn and what our teachers can do to support that learning.
Combining future-focused curriculum with informed technology use, and championing an approach to learning design that places students at the centre of the creative learning experience, learning.futures' ultimate aim is to produce graduates who are ready for the future of work. 
The learning.futures approach to supporting student learning is evidence-based, involving active and collaborative learning with an effective blend of online, face-to-face and externally engaged learning experiences and authentic assessment. 
Students mingling in collaborative classroom
learning.futures is represented in a cycle of learning, where the focus is on what the student does as part of an active process of sense-making. This means no matter the setting – be it in large classes such as lectures or smaller classes such as tutorials – we aim to teach in ways that engage students in their learning, offering opportunities to apply what they are learning, try ideas out, get feedback – which may be from other students, the teacher or their own observations – and deepen their understanding.
The below video from 2019 shows how the UTS model of learning combines with learning.futures and explains how our students might learn across the phases from the perspective of the student.
Video: learning.futures for UTS students.

The UTS Model of Learning and our graduate attributes framework tell us what our students will be learning. Our learning strategy talks about how students will be learning. This diagram shows that in the future, students at UTS will experience the seamless integration of the best of online and face-to-face learning. 
They'll still come onto campus. But they'll also be using a whole range of technologies to support their learning. Let's look now at learning from the perspective of the student. Students have particular learning goals. And they need to be able to access ideas and content. 
But before coming onto campus, they should be accessing the enormous volume of resources that are available as open education resources that might watch a video from a mooc. They'll use their laptops and mobile devices to access other e-learning resources. 
Perhaps they'll watch content-rich videos from iTunes U, YouTube, TED-Ed, the Khan Academy. They'll also read books and journal articles. And they'll access our library database to find peer-reviewed information. And then they'll come onto campus where they'll go into one of our new collaborative classrooms. 
And in there, they'll engage in high quality interactive learning experiences that make use of the content that they have already engaged with. The next part of our learning strategy looks at the ways in which students will make sense of the information they've engaged with to test out their ideas. 
And they should be undertaking some form of activity that helps them bring together that loose collection of ideas to create meaning. They might do a laboratory experiment. Or they might make a model in architecture. They might design something-- some kind of activity that helps them link the theory and practice. 
They might do a group work project. They might talk with a learning mentor. They might talk with their tutors. They might go out to industry and undertake a work-based learning project or an internship or a cadetship. And hopefully, they'll also have an opportunity to travel, because that's a very important part of our UTS Model of Learning that we prepare our students to work in a global environment. 
The next part of this learning journey is for the students to get feedback on their actions. Performing an action without feedback is a bit of a waste of time. So they might get feedback via UTSOnline just from talking to their tutor. Or they might get feedback from Twitter, Facebook, or Skype. 
Hopefully, they'll also have access to a personal learning network that might be face to face, or it might be online. The final part of their learning journey is to reflect on what it is they understood. What they did to try out those ideas. What the feedback was. And, therefore, how they might change their current understanding. 
Hopefully, they'll sit and think. But they also might write a blog. Or they might write a reflective essay, and thus, complete the learning cycle. 
learning.futures was introduced to UTS in 2012 with the initial focus on bringing pedagogical changes that complement the creation of new collaborative learning spaces. This has led to a reimagined physical campus with a suite of billion-dollar buildings to support an expanding future-focused university. The result of this work was the introduction of technology-enabled collaborative spaces, group work pods, informal study hang-outs, and the aptly named 'Super Lab'.

You'll have some lectures and you'll also participate in many other forms of learning such as debates, simulations and groupwork projects.Some of these will be face-to-face, and others, online.You'll discover new spaces in our campus which have been designed to enable this new kind of learning like collaborative theatres, groupwork spaces, interactive high-tech pods, and learning commons where you can study alone or with others. You'll find that at university learning isn’t just about collecting facts. More and more it’s about being able to respond to tasks and challenges and finding solutions as well as learning to think critically.It's about working with others, as well as working with technology. And about learning how to seek out the best quality and most up-to-date information from a huge range of sources.You'll learn how to navigate the evolving digital world.You'll find that at UTS it's not all exams and essays there are different ways that you’ll be assessed.You'll discover that success is also about making personal and professional networks at UTS that will last you a lifetime.The more you get involved in what UTS has to offer the more you'll benefit.And there's a lot to get involved in.You'll need to be working right from the start towards getting that great job, so it's worth knowing a little bit more about what your future employer is looking for.The grades you achieve over the course of your degree rank only 4th on the list of what employers are looking for.The number one thing employers look for are strong interpersonal skills and the ability to communicate.They want to see that you can speak and write well and relate to others.Second most important is your drive, passion and commitment to the industry that you’ll be joining.That's partly what you know, but it's mostly about your attitude.Third on the list are your technical, analytical and problem-solving skills. The way you think and reason.So while grades are definitely important, they're not the only thing that will get you a job or advance your career in the long term.Helen Bobbitt: I would say the academic and the GPA is a small part of a candidate’s application. So we’re looking to see that candidates are involved in things outside of their academic studies to show that they’ve built other skills.Daniel Lacey: In terms of skills that we look for we look for team work, that’s a huge one in consultancy.

You at UTS!
In 2020 the global pandemic dramatically changed the ways we teach and how our students learn.  While key elements of the original learning.futures strategy remain relevant and robust, lessons learned from staff and students in the shift to emergency remote teaching and learning have informed an evolution to learning.futures 2.0.
The changes draw from what we have learned from the rapid shift in our teaching, particularly how we take advantage of technological advances to enhance the digital learning space and ensure a positive blended learning experience for our students. These changes have led to a new model of priorities in the UTS student experience, including:
At UTS, our digital learning environment supports and enables our learning.futures approach to blended learning. This state-of-the-art digital ecosystem is constantly evolving to complement our wonderful on-campus learning environments. 
Canvas is the heart of our digital learning environment. Through the multi-year LX Transformation program, UTS learning designers and academics worked together to create a consistent, engaging student experience across sites and courses. Canvas is seamlessly integrated with other interactive learning technologies such as: H5P, which allows academics to create interactive online modules and lessons to improve the student learning experience; and Kaltura, which allows students to access rich multimedia content.
Academics at UTS use a range of tools to create opportunities for students to collaborate and work in teams together online, including Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Our polling tool Mentimeter helps make classes interactive. We are continuing to evolve the digital learning ecosystem with innovative technologies – an example of this is Acawriter, helping students become better writers through feedback on their academic and reflective writing. 
In 2021 we embarked on a new journey with Portfolium, an online portfolio platform with social networking features where students can curate their profile with achievements, projects and competencies and use this to showcase their skills to their peers and potential employers. 
You can read about technologies available for use in learning and teaching at UTS on the LX site.
Video: Welcome to the UTS Library
Discover the Library at the centre of campus and online. Quiet and silent study areas, 24 hour access to over a million resources, online chat, email, and in-person advice.
UTS's learning.futures strategy won the Hybrid Learning Innovation category of the 2015 Wharton-QS Stars Reimagine Education Awards in Philadelphia. Dubbed the 'Oscars' of higher education awards, the competition comprised of over 500 entries from 40 countries competing for just 10 awards. What's more, US-based higher education think tank Ithaka believes that there is much to learn from learning.futures at UTS. Read the Case Study. 
The outcomes of the learning.futures strategy are evidenced in the results of the national Student Experience Survey (SES), a survey where UTS students evaluate their university experience. Since introducing learning.futures, the focus area of learner engagement has statistically ranked significantly higher than the Australian average.
You can dive deeper into UTS's SES results and compare our results with other universities on the ComparEd and QILT websites.
Here's what some students said were the best aspects of their UTS courses in the 2020 SES:
The best aspects of my course would involve the flexibility in learning subjects to my areas of liking and interest. The learning objectives met for each subject and the ease of pressure in learning at one's own pace. Other aspects would include the freedom in approaching our professors, tutors, or any administrative staff, access to advanced computer systems/devices, and lastly, the enormous access to study spaces.
Master of Information Technology
The resources available like the studios, library and study spaces. The teachers are super knowledgeable and approachable and are very easy to engage with, from small questions and issues to highly complex ideas and theories. All the content provided is fantastic, the courses are really well curated with interesting and relevant content. The teachers and staff have all really made an effort to work with such difficult circumstances and I think they should be congratulated on their efforts.
Bachelor of Music and Sound Design
Applicable real-world learning experiences. UTS teaches in a way that makes students understand their industry and provides practical experience.
Bachelor of Business
Mostly the idea that it is learning in an environment reminiscent to an actual workspace as well as producing something that can then be used in a showreel for the future.
Master of Animation and Visualisation
The best aspects of my course this year were learning spaces and the opportunities in which I was allowed to pursue my passions with support from my teachers.
Bachelor of Design in Fashion and Textiles
So how exactly is learning.futures practices different? The below table outlines the ways that learning has shifted at UTS as a result of learning.futures. 
...with an emphasis on educating for professional practice and for social good – making a difference to the professions, society and planet.
...across the course with students’ clear understanding and appreciation of the value of them and ability to articulate how they have developed them, supported by evidence – plus a focus on strengthening the Indigenous Graduate Attribute.
..as integrated collaborative learning activities;  to encourage creating, sharing and reusing content.
...to ensure continuous feedback in various forms (from peers, academics, industry, informally, in relation to assessment and automated) to support students making sense of ideas and deepening learning and development of self-efficacy and professional judgement. Technology enhanced through AI, automated.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/business-courses/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-accounting/program-sponsors/bachelor-accounting-sponsorship-information,"The UTS Bachelor of Accounting was established in 1989 with the support of the Australian Society for Certified Practising Accountants (ASCPA - now CPA Australia) and the Chartered Accountants Australia & New Zealand (CAANZ).  The Business Council of Australia, ASCPA and CAANZ first identified the need for co-operative education programs in Information Technology and Accounting prior to 1989 with the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) supporting such cooperative education programs provided they were supported by industry.  Early discussions with industry partners revealed a perceived shortage of high-calibre business graduates and the desire to support a co-operative education program that would attract and develop high-potential students into an accounting career.
The Bachelor of Accounting was designed to meet the needs of employers for multi-skilled accounting graduates and is:
Our sponsor organisations, mostly commercial and financial service organisations, reap the benefits of being able to develop and recruit young people for a future in accounting and business management.
Sponsor organisations are involved in:
Sponsor organisations benefit by being able to:
Students benefit from the financial support the scholarship provides and the invaluable experience gained in their two industry placements with sponsor organisations. Students are assured of excellent career prospects upon graduation and sponsors gain access to the best talent for their graduate recruitment.
In 2018 students in the Bachelor of Accounting program will receive a scholarship valued at:
In addition to the scholarship, which runs for 2½ years of the 3-year course, students can claim a Recruitment Incentive of $ 9,000 in their third year if recruited by a sponsor organisation (see below). This would bring the total received over the three years to $51,000.

https://www.uts.edu.au/partners-and-community/initiatives/indigenous-education-and-research-uts/everyones-responsibility,"We believe Indigenous education is not only about creating opportunities for Indigenous people, but is equally about creating opportunities for all Australians to gain a deeper understanding of Indigenous Australia. It is about taking us all into the future. It is about nation building.
UTS takes a whole-of-university approach to Indigenous education and employment. By raising its status, we have made the university’s commitment to Indigenous people and knowledge core business – everyone's responsibility.
The cornerstone of this approach is our Indigenous Education and Employment Policy which assists us to actively work towards the sentiments in our Reconciliation Statement. It also aligns UTS with national Indigenous higher education objectives and internationally recognised principles.
Aside from affirming the principle of self-determination for Indigenous people, our policy ensures the university will create opportunities for all UTS students to gain knowledge of Indigenous Australia. 
We are committed to providing culturally safe spaces for Indigenous students within Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and Research, but also at the university as a whole, so that Indigenous students feel confident that their experience at UTS is an inclusive one.
Part of this commitment sees us embedding certain practices into the public and ceremonial day-to-day life at UTS.
We are happy to advise staff regarding the ways in which they can recognise Indigenous people and our land:
Two UTS-wide integrated Indigenous strategies have been put in place in support of this new policy:
Both strategies set key objectives over a multi-year period and identify prominent staff across UTS who are responsible for their implementation, achievement and reporting.
We believe this whole-of-university approach is one of the most comprehensive in the country and as part of that approach we've established a comprehensive Indigenous governance structure to oversee the development and progression of the university’s Indigenous commitments.

https://www.uts.edu.au/partners-and-community/initiatives/indigenous-education-and-research-uts/pro-vice-chancellor-indigenous-leadership-and-engagement,"At UTS we are proud of our long record of leadership in the areas of Indigenous education and research.
 

One of our most innovative initiatives has been to take a whole-of-university approach to Indigenous education and employment. By raising its status within the university, we have made the university’s Indigenous commitment core business – the responsibility of all of us.
The cornerstone of this approach is our Indigenous Education and Employment Policy, which aligns UTS with national Indigenous higher education objectives and internationally recognised principles. Aside from ascribing to the principle of self-determination for Indigenous people, our policy commits the university to create opportunities for all UTS students to gain knowledge of Indigenous Australia and embeds acts of Indigenous recognition and partnership within the public and ceremonial life of UTS.
Two UTS-wide integrated Indigenous strategies support this policy: the Indigenous Education Strategy (encompassing student recruitment, support services, curricula issues and research) and the Wingara Indigenous Employment Strategy. Both strategies set key objectives over a multi-year period and identify prominent staff across UTS who are responsible for their implementation, achievement and reporting.
Senior staff from across UTS have partnered with Indigenous academic and non-academic staff to consolidate their expertise into five specialist sub-committees. These sub-committees report to an overarching Vice-Chancellor’s Indigenous Strategies Committee, which in turn is guided by the Vice-Chancellor’s Indigenous Advisory Committee composed of external Indigenous community leaders and specialists. We believe this whole-of-university approach is one of the most comprehensive in the country.
UTS’s genuine commitment to these strategies can be demonstrated through just a few of our initiatives:
We are also extremely proud of our research. Jumbunna has an outstanding and internationally acknowledged record of research output and Indigenous advocacy. Our research team is one of the few in the country that engages in inquiry and social advocacy based on conversations with the community. Independent and fearless, we do the controversial work that others shy away from.
We ensure that our research outputs are published in accessible formats, which benefit the communities they were designed to support. Ours is the only Indigenous research team in Australia that champions issues through our active litigation arm.
Our belief at UTS is that Indigenous education is not just delivered by and for Indigenous people, but is delivered by and for all Australians. While Indigenous education does, in part, mean the creation of educational opportunities and the pursuit of academic excellence for Indigenous people, it is equally about the creation of opportunities for all Australians to gain a deeper understanding of Indigenous Australia – the most ancient and ongoing thread in our national fabric. It is about taking us all into the future. It is about nation building.
We at UTS, and at Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and Research, are proud to be leaders in this movement.
Professor Michael McDaniel brings more than two decades' experience in Indigenous education to his role as the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Indigenous Leadership and Engagement) and the Director, Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and Research."

In addition, there is support through direct access to administration and facilities provided by our overseas partners.
All UTS offshore courses offered outside Australia are accredited by UTS the same as the equivalent courses offered in Sydney. The same admission requirements and completion requirements apply. Offshore course students meeting the completion requirements will be conferred the relevant UTS degree award, as graduates completing the equivalent courses delivered at UTS, Sydney.
Applicants should apply through our partners in the respective offshore course locations.

You are an international student if:
In most cases international students will need to obtain an Australian student visa to study at UTS in Sydney. International students are also allowed to work in Australia. Generally, student can work up to 40 hours per fortnight while school is in session, and full time during school breaks, but currently international students can work as many hours as they like in ANY industry.  Note that this is temporary and the government has stated hours will be capped again in June 2023.
For up-to-date information about visa regulations and work rights, we recommend checking the Department of Home Affairs website.
On September 2, the government announced that international graduates with select degrees will be able to stay in Australia for longer. Once verified, degrees in fields of skill shortages will rise from:
At UTS, we hope that our students will continue to stay in Australia and bring their endless positive impact. The latest information on post-study work rights and work visas can be found on the Australian Government Education website."
https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/info-international-students/your-rights-and-responsibilities/tuition-protection-service,"International students are protected by a Tuition Protection Service under Australian Government legislation. The aim of this protection is to ensure that students receive the tuition they have paid for or, as a last resort, a refund.
The legislation sets out what happens when a registered provider or an overseas student or intending overseas student defaults (that is, when a provider fails to start or finish providing a course to a student, or a student fails to start or finish a course with a provider).
The legislation establishes a universal single Tuition Protection Service (TPS) to provide a flexible and streamlined approach to student placement and refund arrangements in the event a defaulting provider does not meet its refund obligations under the ESOS Act.
Students will be given an active role in selecting from suitable placement options through an online information service. Where a student does not access a placement through the placement facility provided by the TPS Director, the student may be eligible for a refund of their unexpended tuition fees from the TPS Director.
Students will be eligible for a refund of the unused portion of any prepaid tuition fees (i.e. tuition for which you have paid but which has not yet been delivered) rather than a full refund, in recognition of the fact that you may obtain credit for the study already completed.
Students should be familiar with the Protocol on refund of fees for international students.
Further complementing the new TPS framework is a limit on the collection of pre-paid course fees to no more than one study period in advance, and to limit the deposit for commencing students to no more than 50% of their total course fee.
UTS complies with all the requirements of the Tuition Protection Service. Further information can be obtained from the Department of Education website (opens an external site)."

Internationalisation is key to a more connected world. It brings new opportunities for the next generations of students, academics and businesses seeking to prosper in and contribute to an increasingly interdependent and global society.
It also brings greater competition and greater potential volatility. The implications of the increasing pace of technological innovation are likely to be profound. They include a huge shift in demand for ‘borderless’ education, collaboration, cultural competency and a global mindset.
UTS is a globally focused institution, performing well internationally across a wide range of areas, as global university rankings show. In 2023, UTS was ranked  #4 in Australia and #14 in the world for positive impact based on its performance against the UN Sustainable Development Goals (THE Impact Rankings 2023). UTS also ranks #90 in the world (QS World University Rankings 2024) and #1 in Australia for International Outlook, which is measured by three indicators: international to domestic student ratio, international to domestic staff ratio, and the proportion of research that involves international collaboration (THE World University Rankings 2022).
UTS has a long and proud international history across research, industry and university partnerships.
We work extensively with partners around the world, including research institutes, universities, industry, governments and businesses to drive positive change. Our partnerships are focused on developing new opportunities for the UTS community, including a commitment to staff and student mobility. 
It is our mission to ensure that all UTS students and staff are internationally engaged and interculturally competent; courses and units are of the highest quality and are internationally relevant; research is of international quality and global impact, and international partnerships and pathways deliver opportunity and value across the university.
Given the ever-increasing pace of change globally, we need to:
Universities must ‘think outside the box’ to embrace the future and remain competitive. We need to be innovative, agile and maintain a sense of urgency in adapting to global changes and quickly evolving geopolitical climates.
Leo Mian Liu (Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Global Partnerships)
UTS's global engagement also aims at diversifying our product offering to leverage our capacity to deliver new and existing courses remotely, catering to new groups of international lifelong learners beyond our traditional award course students. Enhancing our international reputation and distinct identity will attract the best minds and support the university's vision to become a leading public university of global impact - making important contributions to the local and global communities we live in.

UTS Science has a High School Work Experience program available for high school students in NSW in conjunction with the Department of Education and Training’s (DET) guidelines.
The program is designed to give student a broad overview of science by engaging the student in each of the above areas for selected periods throughout the week. A typical program looks like this:
We aim to offer students who are genuinely interested in science a chance to obtain a placement in our program.
Further, we would like to give students from all backgrounds the opportunity to participate in our program. Thus, we try to allocate 50% of our placements to students from rural and regional areas in NSW. This also means we can only accept two students from each school.
If there are more than two applicants from the same school, students from that school may be selected on a first come, first placed basis. We also try to team up students who are in the same year.
As much as possible the student will be involved actively in the work of the areas listed. However because of Work, Health & Safety constraints and because of the prior need for knowledge, accuracy and skill, the actual hands-on content is limited. Allowable and safe activities may include:
Induction and information is provided to ensure safety in the laboratory.  Personal protective equipment such as laboratory coats, safety glasses and gloves are provided.
The work experience student is supervised at all times when in the laboratory. Task supervisors are most likely to be a member of technical staff, but may at times be an academic or a postgraduate research student.
We don’t accept requests for work experience in one particular area for longer than the time indicated in the typical program because of the limitations of staff availability. 
While there are many requests from students expressing their desire to spend a full week in the forensic science area, we are unable to meet this request.
The normal working day for work experience is 9.00 am to 4.00 pm, though this is subject to variation. We usually allow an hour for lunch.
You will be in a laboratory and not in an office. Wear comfortable day clothes and regular shoes or joggers that are sturdy and cover all of the feet (you won’t be allowed into the labs without proper footwear). Don’t wear expensive clothing.
If a student needs to leave earlier than the time specified, either their school or a parent should notify us of this in advance by phone or email.
We allow students the freedom to explore the wider University campus where various cafés and UTS Union facilities are located, as well as nearby fast food outlets on George Street.
We require the student to remain in mobile phone contact during this time. If a parent or a school wishes to constrain the student’s movement to within the Science building only, then please advise us accordingly.
Students are provided with a locker to house bags and personal belongings.
Our work experience program this year will run during the UTS Spring and Summer sessions. Please note we are not able to host work experience students outside these times.
If you are still interested in applying for 2023, please check-in on our website for openings early next year.

https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/info-international-students/your-rights-and-responsibilities/educational-services-overseas-students,"Australia has a reputation as a safe, progressive and dynamic place to study for international students. To maintain this reputation the Australian Government has established a legislative framework to ensure the provision of quality education and consumer protection for all international students coming to Australia to study on student visas. This legislation is known as the ESOS (Education Services for Overseas Students) Framework.The legislation is designed to:
The ESOS Framework, in combination with migration law, sets out certain rights and responsibilities that you have as an international student. This legislation applies to you only if you are studying in Australia on a student visa. If you are studying on another kind of visa or studying offshore you are not subject to these requirements.
On 1 January 2018, new legislation regulating the provision of education to international students on student visas came into effect. This legislation created changes to the ESOS Framework and is contained in a document commonly referred to as the National Code 2018. If you are on a student visa (except subclass 576) then the most significant changes for you as an international student are as follows:
You must be enrolled in a full-time course for the full duration of your student visa.You are now also expected to complete your course by the end date specified on your COE. For example, a Bachelor of Business degree should be completed in 3 years.At UTS, this means:
Q. How do I know my expected completion date?A. Your expected completion date is the end date indicated on your Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE).Q. What if I am unable to complete my course by this date?A. You will be permitted to extend your CoE (and your student visa) in certain circumstances. These include:
Q. What if I want to drop a subject for academic or personal reasons?A. Under certain circumstances this will be possible. UTS International has a formal policy outlining the circumstances in which you will be able to reduce your academic load.Q. I will be completing my course soon, but will need to extend my visa to do so. I have never been placed on Academic Caution and have not taken Leave of Absence. Will I be able to complete my course?A. If you will not be able to complete your course on time because of enrolment or course advice that you have previously received from the University, then this will be considered a compelling circumstance and your CoE will be extended to enable you to complete your course. This advice includes the advice - correct until 1 July - that you may enrol in 18 credit points per semester.Further information about this requirement and how it will be managed by the University will be distributed to students in due course.
The conditions attached to your student visa require you to maintain your enrolment at the University for the full duration of your visa.If you need to take a break from your studies it is possible to apply to UTS for Leave of Absence; however, you are only able to take Leave of Absence and maintain the validity of your student visa under very limited circumstances, for example for medical or compassionate reasons.If you wish to apply for Leave of Absence you must first contact UTS International on internationalstudent@uts.edu.au or by phone +61 2 9514 1531.
Q. What happens when I apply for Leave of Absence?A. If your leave of absence is approved by your Faculty, UTS International will then assess whether your application for a leave of absence fits the criteria for suspension of study under the National Code 2018. If so, then your leave of absence will be reported to the Department of Home Affairs as a suspension of study and you will normally be able to maintain your student visa.Q. Can I stay in Australia while on Leave of Absence?A. Because your student visa conditions require you to be studying while in Australia, you must normally return home while on leave of absence. If a medical condition prevents you from travelling then you may apply to the Department of Home Affairs to remain in Australia for the period of the leave of absence.Q. Under what circumstances can I apply for Leave of Absence and maintain the validity of my student visa?A. Under the National Code 2018, UTS is able to approve leave of absence on compassionate or compelling grounds. These generally refer to circumstances which are beyond your control and which have an impact upon your course progress or wellbeing. Each application for a leave of absence will be assessed on its own merits and must be supported by appropriate documentation.Q. For how long can I take Leave of Absence without my visa being cancelled?A. You can continue to hold your visa only if you take a leave of absence for 6 months or less. This applies even if your leave of absence is approved on compassionate or compelling grounds. If you apply for leave of absence for longer than 6 months or you do not return from your leave of absence after 6 months then your visa will normally be cancelled.Q. What are some examples of compassionate or compelling grounds?A. Examples of acceptable grounds would include, but are not limited to:
Q. What if my reasons for applying for Leave of Absence are not deemed to be compassionate or compelling under the National Code 2018? Can I still take Leave of Absence from my course? What will happen to my visa?A. Yes, you can take leave of absence as long as your leave of absence is approved by your Faculty. However, if your reasons for taking leave of absence are not deemed to be compassionate or compelling under the National Code 2018 - as assessed by UTS International - then your Confirmation of Enrolment will be cancelled. The Department of Home Affairs will then assess your visa status and may decide to cancel your visa. In this case you will need to apply for a new visa when you wish to return to your studies.Q. How do I apply for Leave of Absence?A. You can apply for leave of absence online, on the UTS student admin website.Be sure to include all supporting documentation. If you wish to apply for a leave of absence on compassionate or compelling grounds and for less than 6 months, or if you are unsure of your circumstances, you should discuss your application with UTS International.
Under the new legislation, you must obtain permission from UTS if you wish to transfer to another institution within the first 6 months of your principal course*. This permission is recorded on your CoE via PRISMS.If you wish to apply for Release in order to transfer to another institution prior or within 6 months of commencing your principal course*, you will need to follow this procedure:
UTS is an approved SSVF provider and recruits students into its degree courses under the SSVF arrangements of the Department of Home Affairs. SSVF enables students to obtain their student visa quickly and usually with less documentation required.
International students apply for a single Student visa (subclass 500) regardless of their chosen course of study. When you are granted a visa under SSVF you must continue to maintain enrolment in an eligible course, and continue to have sufficient financial capacity to support your study and stay in Australia.
All Student visa (subclass 500) holders must maintain enrolment at the same level or a higher Australian Qualification Framework (AQF) level for which they were granted a visa, unless they are undertaking a doctoral degree (AQF10) and transfer to a master’s degree (AQF9). Transferring to a lower AQF level course or transferring from an AQF level course to a non-AQF Award course is a breach of the student visa condition and might result in the visa being cancelled.
Students who want to change to a lower level course or non-award course must apply for, and be granted, a new student visa before they change their course. You must take this important information into account when choosing a course and if considering a course change or a move to another provider.
Visit the Department of Home Affairs website (opens an external website) for information about changing your course and meeting the conditions of your student visa, or for more detail about SSVF (opens an external website).
Q. What reasons for seeking release would be considered acceptable?A. The University may grant a release where it is satisfied that one of the following circumstances apply:
Special circumstances include, but are not limited to:
Read more on the complete UTS release protocol.Q. * What is my principal course?A. If your student visa covers a package of courses, then your principal course is the final course in your package. The other courses are preliminary courses. For example, you may have been accepted into a Bachelor of Commerce course but been required to complete a 10-week English-language course and a 2-year diploma at UTS College before commencing your Bachelor's. In this example your principal course is the Bachelor of Commerce. You would need to be granted release from UTS if you wish to transfer to a different institution at any time prior to completing 6 months of the Bachelor of Commerce.Q. I have been granted a package of courses, but now want to take my preliminary course at another institution before returning to UTS to study my principal course. Do I need to apply for release even if I am going to return to UTS?A. Yes. You need to apply for release if you wished to transfer to a different institution at any time prior to completing 6 months of your principal course, even if you plan to return to UTS to study your principal course.
If you are considering altering your enrolment in any way, please contact UTS International.

Students who have selected to live in residential accommodation (Scape) must enter into approved welfare arrangements with ISA Guardians & Welfare Services. The UTS College accommodation team will forward your details and communicate with the primary contact on your Scape application form to request relevant documents to proceed with the application. 
Where UTS issues a CAAW to a student, the student must:
Where a student does not meet these obligations, UTS will discuss the issue/s with the student. If the student continues to breach these obligations, UTS will advise them that their CAAW letter may be terminated, in which case the student will need to ensure alternate accommodation and welfare arrangements are in place.
Students should refer to the UTS U18 International Student Protocol for more information.
You must update your contact details within seven days of arriving in Australia. This is a student visa requirement. You must also update your next of kin (parent or legal guardian) contact details.
You will receive instructions on how to update your contact details in your pre-departure information pack.
All students under 18 must attend the Essential International Advice session as part of the UTS orientation at the start of each session. These sessions cover important welfare information such as adjusting to life in Australia, how to seek assistance in emergency situations, how to report incidents, Australian laws, etc.
Students residing in UTS-approved accommodation will be provided with an additional orientation session organised by UTS College regarding their accommodation and welfare arrangement.
Under the terms of the Confirmation of Appropriate Accommodation and Welfare (CAAW), international students under 18 are required to reside at the address of their approved accommodation at all times and may not stay overnight at any other address without prior approval from UTS.
Requests for absences from approved accommodation will only be considered in the following circumstances (all relevant information, documentation and consent must be provided):
Once a CAAW letter is issued, the student must not arrive in Australia before the start date on the CAAW letter. Arriving in Australia without appropriate welfare arrangements is a breach of the student’s visa conditions, which may lead to cancellation of their visa by the Department of Home Affairs.
Students must inform the UTS College Accommodation Team of their arrival date and time so that UTS College can arrange approved transport for the student to be met at the airport.
Students are obliged to use UTS College-approved transport from the airport and are not permitted to make their own arrangements. Even if they are accompanied by a parent/legal guardian, the student must still use the UTS College-approved transport. The parent/legal guardian must make their own transport arrangements.
If a student is transferring to UTS from another provider, and requests UTS to issue a CAAW, UTS will ensure there is no gap in welfare arrangements. UTS will liaise with the student’s original provider and UTS College to negotiate the transition from the original provider’s CAAW to the UTS CAAW.
Students must note that UTS will not issue a CAAW:
Therefore, if a student’s original provider does not maintain the CAAW until that period, UTS may not be able to issue a CAAW to cover the gap. In such cases, the student must return home (overseas) or have alternative arrangements in place that are approved by the Department of Home Affairs.
If a student wishes to change their accommodation and welfare arrangements, because they are/will be deferring studies, returning overseas or will be cared for by a parent or nominated relative, they must:
Where a student is approved for leave of absence, UTS will not maintain the CAAW. The student must return overseas or have a nominated guardian approved by the Department of Home Affairs. A new CAAW will be issued with the dates of the session the student is expected back.
Find out more about arranging leave of absence.
Where a student is offshore and defers their commencement for their first session, UTS will cancel the CAAW along with the CoE and re-issue it with the new dates of the session the student deferred to, if the student will still be under 18 on arrival in Australia.
Where a student is onshore and defers their commencement for their first session, their original provider must either extend their CAAW to cover the gap or the student must return overseas. If UTS has issued a CAAW in this instance, the CAAW will be cancelled and re-issued with the new dates of the session the student deferred to, if the student will still be under 18 on arrival in Australia.
Find out more about deferral.
In certain circumstances, UTS has the right to terminate a student’s CAAW. This action will only be used as a last resort.
Circumstances under which UTS can no longer approve accommodation, welfare and support include, but are not limited to:
UTS has a range of procedures in place for the management of critical incidents. Students must contact UTS Security in the event of any critical incident on campus as the first point of contact (refer to section Important Contacts > Emergency Contacts below).
More information on emergencies and critical incidents can be accessed on the UTS website:
Grievances and complaints specific to accommodation and welfare services must be made to the UTS College accommodation team.
All students may submit a complaint and/or appeal directly to UTS by following the UTS Student Complaints Policy and Student Complaints Management Procedures.
If you need further information and/or assistance, please contact the relevant UTS International team. It is a good idea to share these contacts with your parents/family/legal guardian.

The university demonstrates its commitment to continuous improvement through:
As part of this quality management approach, UTS benchmarks its performance, ideas and practices against other organisations and reviews its activities and processes.
UTS has developed its own Academic Standards Framework to ensure high quality outcomes for students and beneficiaries of research, engagement and other academic activities.  The framework aligns with the Commonwealth Government’s Higher Education Standards Framework.  In 2013, UTS received re-registration as a Higher Education Provider for the maximum period of seven years by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA).  In late 2018, TEQSA extended UTS's provider registration to April 2023."

We would also like to pay respect to the Elders both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for these lands.
The university recognises Indigenous Australian people as the first people of this continent, and understands that the history and knowledge developed over many thousands of years by Indigenous Australian people was severely disrupted at the time of early colonial settlements. The past 200 years have left many Indigenous people at the crossroads with poor health, education and employment prospects.
The UTS Reconciliation Statement reasserts an ongoing commitment by the university to provide educational opportunities in the higher education sector for Indigenous people and, through research and education, the restoration of their histories and knowledge systems.
As part of this ongoing commitment, the university will strive to build an educational environment that is genuinely inclusive of Indigenous people. This will be done through:

When I was at high school I just remember just thinking that university is unattainable. It's that place where students from a diverse background such as myself or a student that wasn't born in Australia couldn't go to necessarily. I think I was one of the students that worried a lot about my ATAR. If we all look back to when we were doing to HSC, the only thing we thought about was I need to go well in the HSC. I think it goes back to the idea that university is that unattainable place. ATAR defines how we're going to get into university. But in reality it's nothing like that. Not everything is fixed on the HSC. It's really not the destination it's kind of the first step into something bigger and if that doesn't work out there's other routes to get to the same destination. University isn't all too scary. University is a place for all people from different ethnic backgrounds, from all religions, from all different sexual orientations and it is not that box that you have to fit in."

Bridget Tyma – Bachelor of Business Bachelor of Science in ITSRS Equity stream studentDuring high school, Bachelor of Business Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student Bridget Tyma worked hard and achieved good results. But when it came to Year 12 a family situation threw her study plans off track. It was Tyma’s school careers coordinator who introduced her to the Schools Recommendation Scheme (SRS). Even before sitting their first HSC exam, eligible Year 12 students can ask their high school to endorse their SRS application.  Tyma says UTS continued to support her as an SRS student into her first year of uni. ""I want to remind students that no matter your situation, there are so many ways to get into the uni of your dreams. Don't let anything stop you from getting there."""

Academic Board plays a key role in the UTS community. It provides a forum for the discussion and debate of the university’s academic direction, and ensures that the university’s academic direction aligns with its strategic direction.
The board promotes academic leadership at UTS by overseeing the quality of teaching, learning, research, scholarship and community service. It refers policy recommendations to Council and discusses matters referred to it by Council.
Dr Jacqueline Rule  Executive Officer (Governance Support)  telephone 02 9514 1464  email AcademicBoard@uts.edu.au or Jacqueline.Rule@uts.edu.au
Academic Board promotes academic leadership at UTS. In order to carry out its work, all board members are required to demonstrate academic leadership.
Academic leadership in this context is manifested through careful preparation for meetings, enabling thoughtful and considered engagement in discussion and debate. The leadership shown through this discussion and debate provides assurance to the Council that the board is contributing to the achievement of UTS's strategic direction.
Members of the board have accountability to the university’s academic community, with responsibility to communicate the board's work. As academic leaders, board members are asked to use their judgement to consider matters brought to the board and to reflect on how their individual contributions influence the collective decision-making of the board.

Students and staff are enjoying many of these spaces right now.
A Sydney icon thanks to its distinctive Frank Gehry design, the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building is home to the UTS Business School Building and opened for teaching in 2015.
 
The reimagined Building 2 opened in August 2019, creating a new student hub in the heart of the UTS campus. Within a distinctive curved glass facade, it accommodates the new UTS Library and Reading Room, the Hive Superlab, world-first collaborative classrooms and a variety of individual and collaborative student study spaces.
The new home to the Faculty of Engineering and IT opened in 2014, providing a dramatic new gateway to UTS’s City Campus. It features the UTS Data Arena, a 360-degree interactive data visualisation facility.
 
Establishing a new science and health precinct at the centre of the UTS campus, this building was accommodates UTS's first 220-seat Super Lab. The building opened for teaching in 2015.
 
The transformation of Alumni Green into a vibrant, tree-lined oasis in the heart of the UTS campus was completed in 2014.

 
The state-of-the-art Library Retrieval System, completed in 2014, allows UTS to manage the storage and retrieval of lesser-used items so that the Library’s physical collection can continue to grow.
 
Once a disused rail corridor, this vibrant, landscaped connection linking Central Station's Devonshire St Tunnel with Darling Harbour now welcomes thousands of pedestrians each week.
 
The first major upgrades to the Tower since it opened in 1979 included replacement of the building's lifts – part of the Tower Core Upgrade – as well as the refurbishment of many floors to accommodate professional staff.

 
The first project completed under the Campus Master Plan, the Ross Milbourne Sports Hall is an underground sports hub at the heart of UTS, which opened in 2011.

 
Opened in 2011, Yura Mudang is a 720-bed residential tower for UTS students, rising above Building 6. It features state-of-the-art apartments, a roof-top terrace, and extensive communal facilities.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/science/science-courses/short-courses/contaminated-site-assessment-remediation-and-management-csarm-short-courses-series,"There is an increasing demand for environmental professionals in the multidisciplinary field of Contaminated Site Assessment, Remediation and Management (CSARM). The program, developed by the School of Life Sciences at UTS Faculty of Science with the support of NSW Environment Protection Authority (NSW EPA) and senior industry professionals, has been successfully training environmental professionals for the past 13 years. Its aim is to help them extend their knowledge base and update their skills in this area, as well as form professional networks with colleagues in industry and government.
Commencing in March 2023, each intensive course module runs for between 2 1/2 and 3 days and includes a mixture of lectures, case studies, and workshops to provide a flexible and interactive learning program. Participants can choose to attend either online or in person. Two of the modules include an optional field trip.
The modules are delivered by experienced professionals in CSARM practice, with at least six different presenters in each module.  They cover NSW EPA and NEPM guidelines and new legislation as well as the technical and scientific aspects of contaminated land practice.
The modules are each delivered only once per year and are designed to be effective as stand-alone courses which can be taken in any order.  Completion of all five modules provides comprehensive coverage of the subject. 
Download the 2023 CSARM brochure (PDF, 5.7MB)
The presenters include regulators from NSW EPA; academic specialists, contaminated site auditors, and professionals and experts in environmental law and risk assessment.
Satisfactory completion of the post-module assignment may entitle you to recognition of prior learning towards a MSc coursework degree.
The CSARM Short Courses can help achieve your Continuing Professional Development (CPD) goals. For example, the EIANZ CEnvP Contaminated Land Specialist scheme requires 100 CPD points over two years. For every hour of CPD you get two points which means that the average CSARM Module attendance gives you at least 42 points per module towards achieving and maintaining your certification. In addition, course presenters can claim five points per hour for face-to-face instruction. For details about consultant certification schemes, visit the CEnvP or CPSS CSAM schemes.
All modules will be held at UTS City campus, with the option to attend online using Zoom platform.  Most presenters will be present on campus to deliver their lectures and workshops.

UTS Engineering and IT research spans widely, from thought-controlled wheelchairs to big data analysis that informs cancer diagnosis, to affordable earthquake-proof housing for people living in disaster-prone regions. Our aim is to look beyond the obvious and come up with useful, tangible ways that have a transformational impact on the world.
In the Faculty of Engineering and IT, we focus on the following research strengths:
Master of Engineering (Research) Enables students to extend and deepen their knowledge of a specialised area in engineering by undertaking research under supervision of a member of academic staff. Doctor of Philosophy Involves an intense period of supervised study and research, culminating in the submission of a thesis. Students must, through original investigation, make a distinct and significant contribution to the knowledge of their field of specialisation.
Master of Engineering (Research) and PhD candidates are supervised by academic research staff with expertise in the candidate's chosen field. With a focus on industry collaboration, proposals that involve direct working relationships with industry professionals are strongly encouraged.

https://www.uts.edu.au/partners-and-community/initiatives/city-campus-master-plan/planning-and-delivery/planning-and-design,"UTS has engaged multi-disciplinary consultant teams to lead the planning and design of all projects proposed under the Master Plan. Early planning and brief development has generally been undertaken in-house. The planning and design process's ultimate aim has been to ensure that each project meets the long-term requirements of the university, including the UTS model of learning and its industry-focused research.
 
All new buildings delivered under the City Campus Master Plan have been subject to the NSW Government's guidelines on design excellence. Architects have generally been selected through a design competition process, which has allowed UTS to explore best practice in learning environments. The notable exception was the appointment of Gehry Partners LLP to design the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building, internationally renowned American architect Frank Gehry's first in Australia.
UTS developed detailed briefs, including faculty and division-specific accommodation schedules where required. An accommodation schedule outlines the spatial requirements of an organisation based on information, such as projected staff and student numbers, and their strategic direction. The university engaged expert consultants to develop these accommodation schedules in close consultation with each end-user (faculty or division) within the university for all new major facilities.
Selected staff and student user-groups have and will be consulted during the design process, as appropriate."
https://www.uts.edu.au/partners-and-community/initiatives/city-campus-master-plan/planning-and-delivery/construction,"Construction of Master Plan projects has been underway since the end of 2010. The first stage concluded with the completion and opening of three new buildings in 2014–15, and further projects are now in progress.
UTS has engaged a variety of contractors to undertake the construction work to date, with each appointed via a competitive tender process. Careful steps have been taken to minimise disruption to students, staff, visitors and the local community during the construction phase of projects.
 
The ongoing operation of the UTS campus throughout construction has been paramount in the university's delivery of the Campus Master Plan.
While some disruption has been inevitable, UTS has taken steps to minimise the noise, dust and vibration generated by construction activities. Key measures have included:
Excavation is generally the most disruptive phase of any construction project, and was completed by end-2012 for the major projects delivered as part of the first stage of the Master Plan, with the demolition of Building 2 completed in 2017.
If you have questions about any aspect of Master Plan construction works you should contact us at ourchangingcampus@uts.edu.au

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/what-do-i-need-know/tips-future-students,"The rewards of undertaking a business degree at UTS Business School are enormous, and it is good to know that there is a large amount of help, support and tuition available to ensure that you achieve your very best in your degree. With study skills help and advice available online as well as face to face, you can be sure that if you need guidance it will never be too far away – whether you’re new to the university experience, or have studied before.
Look around the UTS Handbook – there is information on all courses and subjects available online, as well as assessment requirements for each subject.
As semester approaches, look over your subject outlines on Canvas and familiarise yourself with the requirements and structure of your classes.
Try to take a look at self-study resources on the internet relating to time management, note-taking, attending lectures and writing essays, etc. to get a feel of what may be required before you start the semester. It’s never too early to have these skills under your belt.
Expect to spend at least two hours studying by yourself for each hour of ‘face to face teaching’. This is a general rule and will depend on the subject involved; but the point to remember that for each subject you undertake, a very large part of the learning and subject knowledge will be undertaken by yourself.
Check your subject outlines for any required or recommended texts. It is a good idea to do this ahead of time so that you are best prepared for the upcoming semester. UTS Library will likely have copies of any materials you will need, though be prepared that you might be sharing these resources with many other students, and you might prefer to obtain your own copy.
It is worthwhile to note that there are some excellent study resources available in good bookshops and online, to help you become familiar with academic writing, university expectations and life as a university student.

* THE Young University Rankings 2023
The most prestigious international rankings agencies have ranked and rated UTS highly in recent years. Here are some of our recent achievements:
Fuller details of our recent rankings and ratings performance are given below.
The Australian Government benchmarked 100 per cent of UTS research in the broad Fields of Research (FOR) at world standard or above in the 2018 Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) evaluation. The results demonstrate an increase in the quality of research at UTS, with more than 70 per cent of our research classified as ‘above world standard’ (ERA ranking 4) or ‘well above world standard’ (ERA ranking 5).
UTS has also increased the number of areas classified as ‘well above world standard’ (the highest assessment), including the following: physical sciences, environmental sciences, agricultural and veterinary sciences, artificial intelligence and image processing, econometrics, macromolecular and materials chemistry, physical chemistry, genetics, biomedical engineering, human movement and sports science, and nursing.
This is the fourth round of ERA, which the Australian Research Council administers to provide an assessment of research excellence within the Australian university sector. The data informs the government’s strategic research investment decision-making process.
The ERA 2018 National Report is available via the ARC website. For more information about UTS’s world-class research, visit the UTS Research website.
In the inaugural Engagement and Impact Assessment (EIA), the Australian Government rated almost 80% of UTS’s assessed research areas as having a “high” impact beyond academia, the highest proportion in the country. In this assessment, research impact was considered in terms of non-academic contributions of research, such as those to the economy, the environment, culture, or society.Areas in which UTS rated “high” in all three areas (Engagement, Impact, and Approach to Impact) were Biological Sciences, Engineering, Medical and Health Sciences, Built Environment and Design, and Law and Legal Studies.The EIA 2018 National Report is available via the ARC website. To read more, visit the UTS new release here.
UTS ranked 9th in Australia at 90 in the QS World University Rankings 2024. The rankings are based on research, teaching, employability and internationalisation.
 
UTS ranked 62nd in the world and 5th in Australia in the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2022. The university's highest indicator was for 'Employer Reputation'.

https://www.uts.edu.au/about/university/overview,"UTS is a public university of technology defined by our support for the economic, social and cultural prosperity of our communities. We are measured by the success of our students, staff and partners and committed to research, innovation and the dissemination of knowledge of public value. We are, and always will be, an inclusive university.
UTS has a culturally diverse campus life and vibrant international exchange study and research programs that prepare graduates for the workplaces of today and the future. Our campus is in the heart of Sydney's creative and digital precinct and alongside Sydney's central business district. Continuing a 10-year period of major development, the ongoing transformation of the UTS campus will ensure we continue to maintain and develop a purpose- and sustainably-built campus to support innovation in education and research.
Meet our University Leadership Team
Our UTS 2027 strategy outlines our vision to be “a leading public university of technology recognised for our global impact” . Our purpose is to advance knowledge and learning through research-inspired teaching, research with impact and partnerships with industry, the professions and community. UTS is part of the  Australian Technology Network of universities: a group of prominent universities committed to working with industry and government to deliver practical and professional courses.
With a total enrolment of over 44,000 students, UTS is one of the largest universities in Australia.
UTS offers over 130 undergraduate and 210 postgraduate courses across traditional and emerging disciplines such as architecture, built environment, business, communication, design, education, engineering, information technology, international studies, law, midwifery, nursing, pharmacy and science.
In line with the UTS model of global practice-oriented learning, many of our students undertake professional practice during their degree. As part of their degree program, students also have the opportunity to study at one of more than 185 universities in about 40 countries with which UTS has exchange agreements.
Our world leading research centres span a range of disciplines, including physical, biological and engineering sciences, and contemporary fields such as design, nanotechnology and sustainability. Our researchers provide practical and relevant solutions to issues of national and international importance and equip graduates with the latest discipline specific skills and practices.
We also maintain strong relationships with the local community, industry, business and the professions through a wide range of partnerships, projects and events.
As a public purpose institution, UTS is committed to supporting positive social change within and beyond our campus. This commitment is reflected by a diverse set of institution wide social justice initiatives that have only expanded in scope and impact since UTS was established. Student-based programs, focused research and innovative teaching approaches aim to create a more just and equitable world.
On 26 January 1988 — with the commencement of the University of Technology, Sydney, Act — the former New South Wales Institute of Technology became the University of Technology, Sydney.
The New South Wales Institute of Technology was established in 1964. The School of Design of the former Sydney College of the Arts was incorporated into the Institute on 25 January 1988.
On 1 January 1990, the Institute of Technical and Adult Teacher Education and the Kuring-gai College of Advanced Education were amalgamated with the existing University of Technology, Sydney to form the current UTS. On 1 August 2015, the comma was removed from the University’s title to become the current University of Technology Sydney.
The purpose and functions of UTS are outlined in the University of Technology Sydney Act 1989 (NSW) and in the constitutions of its controlled entities."
https://www.uts.edu.au/partners-and-community/initiatives/city-campus-master-plan/planning-and-delivery/background-master-plan,"The City Campus Master Plan was developed by architects Bligh Voller Nield (opens an external site) and their consultant team. They were managed by a UTS team who ensured that the architects undertook extensive consultation with senior UTS representatives (including representatives from each faculty and the library). The Master Plan was adopted by UTS Council in 2008.
A master plan is a strategic document showing the fundamental principles and processes that guide a future project. The City Campus Master Plan encapsulated UTS's long-term strategic objectives and showed how these could be reached through the intelligent revitalisation of our campus, its buildings and open spaces.
The City Campus Master Plan did not provide design outcomes for projects. Instead, it formulated broad guidelines and principles that informed the designs (for example, building height, floor space, sustainability goals, etc). All major projects in the Master Plan have been subject to separate approvals both by UTS Council and relevant local/state government authorities, such as the Department of Planning (external site) and the City of Sydney (external site)."
https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/industry-partnerships/partnership-options-archive/commercialisation,"UTS is at the cutting edge of creativity and technology and is known as a preferred partner for industry and government. We welcome investors who bring funds, credibility, expertise and network to invest into our new ventures, and we license all the intellectual property developed during a project to our industry partners, assisting them to develop commercially successful products.
Our professional approach is steeped in a strong history of industry linkage and creativity, and so we work at a pace fully on par with industry. Our team approach aims to develop creative, win-win solutions to benefit all parties. This flexible approach enables industry partners to structure a licence deal to best fit their needs."

https://www.uts.edu.au/partners-and-community/initiatives/city-campus-master-plan/precinct,"In recent years, the southern gateway to the city has been completely transformed. A vibrant, diverse and  growing community has been drawn to the precinct thanks to the UTS Campus Master Plan, The Goods Line – a New York-style pedestrian connection created from a disused rail line – the Central Park retail/residential project on Broadway, Kensington St's Spice Alley and other developments in the Ultimo, Chippendale, Pyrmont and Darling Harbour area.
Today, the evolution continues, with projects such as UTS Central.
UTS is proud to collaborate with our local partners in creating what will be one of the city’s great creative and cultural precincts. Our partners, the ABC, Powerhouse Museum, Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority and Frasers Park, are involved in a number of key projects:
The billion-dollar-plus Campus Master Plan is a major investment into driving Sydney’s economy that is expected to contribute an estimated $3.2 billion for the NSW economy.
The Master Plan and precinct revitalisation are increasing tourism revenue for Sydney, with the Gehry-designed Dr Chau Chak Wing Building expected to attract 24,000 interstate and 2000 international visitors each year.
The ten-year construction program is creating 700 direct jobs and 1000 indirect jobs each year, worth approximately $650 million in annual income to workers. 
Once complete, the Master Plan will generate an additional 670 direct and indirect permanent jobs worth $44 million in income annually.

https://www.uts.edu.au/node/4330,"Eleanor Limprecht is enrolled in the Doctorate of Creative Arts in Writing. She is in the process of completing her second novel, a work of historical fiction inspired by the story of a woman who was charged with manslaughter in 1909 and convicted to serve three years at the Long Bay Women’s Reformatory.
“I’m writing a historical novel based on real prison and court documents about a woman who was conducting an illegal abortion when her patient died,” Eleanor says.
“There is still a great deal of silence about women’s sexuality and the control of their fertility — not many people realise how common it was for women to take these matters into their own hands, even in the early 1900s.”
The book is Eleanor’s second novel. She commenced the work after completing a Masters of Creative Writing in 2007, which helped her to see the role of universities in creative pursuits.
“I realised that by doing a Doctor of Creative Arts I could access the experience of a supervisor and the research facilities in order to strengthen my work,” she says.
Eleanor is currently working with two supervisors — Dr Paula Hamilton, a historian, and Dr Debra Adelaide, a novelist — who provide her with valuable insights into the creative process. She says that UTS has come into its own as a research institute in recent years and that students with an interest in the arts would do well to find themselves within the university’s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.
“I like the urban, contemporary sensibility of UTS — it is a vibrant place. I have seen it change in recent years and become a more inclusive campus. There always seems to be something interesting happening.”

https://www.uts.edu.au/node/4331,"Science PhD student Toby Shanley is a Chancellor’s Research Scholarship (CRS) recipient who has developed a photoelectron yield spectroscopy system that uses a gas cascade to amplify the photocurrent.
“What this means it that for the first time ever we are able to examine things like reaction rates for oxidisation, reduction and fluorination; and the effect and strength of dipoles generated by adsorption of molecular species, to name a few,” he says.
“This instrument is a tool for other scientists, granting the ability to perform important solid-gas interface measurements. It represents a full forward step in the rapid evolution of surface science.”
His scholarship has, he says, freed up his time in a way that allows him to have a balance between work and home, and to continue his work as a laboratory demonstrator at UTS on top of his studies.
“If not for the CRS, I would certainly be taking on more work outside of my studies and I have no doubt that [that] would deeply affect not only my progress, but the progress of those around me and my relationships with my supervisors and colleagues,” he says.
Toby chose to undertake a PhD at UTS because of its highly regarded expertise in electron microscopy and related techniques, but says the UTS science faculty was also a draw card.
“There is a great combination of people here — down-to-earth ones, nerds and dreamers, all of them passionate and inspiring. I really enjoy the time I spend with my colleagues and supervisors,” he says.

Core to these diverse disciplines is a commitment to fostering original thinking — instilling our graduates with the ability to structure and develop cohesive arguments and think critically and independently. As a result our teaching practices, and those of our education graduations, are directly shaped and influenced by the research being undertaken at UTS.
By focusing on research and teaching integration, we expose our students to current issues impacting Australia and beyond, instil inquisitiveness and inspire an interest in lifelong learning. Alongside this, our research engages with industry and community to deliver real impact and benefit.
At UTS, we have six research theme areas, spanning communication and intelligent systems, creative industries and civil societies to future services, industry and productivity. Disciplines within arts and social sciences cut across each of these areas.

We believe that discovery, problem-solving and critical thinking are central to successful research and underpin successful learning.
In the video below, Dr Melissa Edwards, a lecturer in management and a member of the Cosmopolitan Civil Societies research centre, explains why students should take an active approach to their learning.
 
Melissa Edwards: I think the most important thing for enhancing the learning experience through the flipped classroom is helping students develop an awareness of their own capacity to be independent learners and that's going to take a different approach right from week one.  So rather than having the expectation that you're coming to get loaded with content when you come into a lecture, we'll be talking to students about how you, as an active learner, use your opportunity at university to make the most of the content that you gather as an independent learner and   that the test of that will be the way in which they engage in the classroom. 
The level of confidence and maturity, the capacity to use critical thinking and to persuade their lecturers and teachers that they have grasped the content will become essential, rather than a test of whether or not they knew the basic foundations of that particular content. 
 
UTS is pioneering design thinking in Australia, this rapidly emerging creative and human-centred approach to problem-solving is changing the face of teaching and research at UTS. Our academics are ensuring that UTS students, across a range of faculties, are embracing this new approach and can utilise these skills to help launch their careers."

Over 30 years our schools have exemplified the best professional education across the design and built environment disciplines, with outcomes spanning traditional exploratory research, industry-focused problem-solving, and creative practice and studio investigations. Core to these diverse disciplines is a commitment to fostering a more just and resilient future, directly shaped and influenced by the research being undertaken by our staff.

my name is philippa carnemolla i'm a
senior research fellow in the faculty of
design architecture and building at the
university of technology sydney and my
expertise is really in examining how the
built environment impacts the
experiences of people particularly
people with disability and older people
who are receiving community care so i
investigate the impact of inclusive
housing and that is the design of the
housing the location of the housing and
how it influences people's independence
autonomy and their community
participation
australia is a large not-for-profit and
our passion is social inclusion for
people with disability we worked with a
developer to build this beautiful set of
apartments
where the whole idea is that it actually
enables people with disability to be
included in a regular community one of
the most important things about this
project is that it enables us to capture
the experiences of people with
intellectual disability from their
perspective how do they experience the
built environment the houses where they
live the communities where they live
i'm here to see lucy lucy lives at
crowler state and she is a participant
in the research that i'm doing on
supported accommodation and finding out
people's experiences of living in their
own apartment and receiving support
[Music]
i had the opportunity to meet over 25
people who live here and who received
support and in particular we'd do some
tours of people's apartments and they'd
speak about the design what they did
what they enjoyed doing what they don't
like about aspects within the built
environment how long have you lived here
for i'm maybe about
i've been living here about four weeks
and a half
what are some of the things you love
about living
a dog oh yeah the dogs are there any
cafes you'd like to go to i really like
the color or the cafe and what do you
have
now
it's about capturing the stories people
here and and weaving those stories
together to get a holistic understanding
of what it means to live in your own
apartment and to receive support and how
you can maximise community participation
because what we find is that time and
time again placing people in community
doesn't mean that people feel a part of
that community
it's been incredibly valuable for us to
actually have
information about the areas that we can
improve and we continue to ask those
questions and philippa continues to have
a relationship with the people here and
reflect back to us what their experience
is
traditionally people who live with an
intellectual disability
and receive 24-hour sport have really
only had one choice and that's living in
a group home this model is an
alternative and it's where people live
with one other person or on their own in
their own apartment and still receive
24-hour support without staff sleeping
over in their apartment what i found was
that this totally changed people's sense
of ownership of place this was their
apartment and theirs only it's their
home
we want people to live really good lives
and that's important for us to actually
understand what that means and having an
independent person like philippa as a
researcher come in and help us
understand that has been so critical for
us what i really hope for is that the
research that i'm building that body of
knowledge will contribute to how our
cities are designed so starting from the
spaces where we live and moving out to
our public spaces and even considering
our cities designing for autonomy
independence and quality of life

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/teaching-and-research-integration/faculty-health,"UTS Health offers innovative, practice-based education and high impact research that focuses on improving health outcomes in both local and global communities. 
A long-standing partner of health professions, UTS Health delivers research with impact that informs policy and improves practice both in Australia and overseas.
UTS: Health, doing research with impact video transcript
Elizabeth Sullivan, Professor of Public Health (ES): UTS is a really dynamic, interesting place to be at the moment.  We’ve got our new buildings, we’ve got the new Vice Chancellor and the new Deputy Vice Chancellor in Research, we’ve got initiatives about recruiting new staff and expanding – expansion into public health and also within a social justice framework where we want to do good for the community and engage with both our collaborators, industry and the local community.  It’s an exciting place to be and I think there are lots of opportunities to do cross-disciplinary research that makes a difference.
Jeffrey Vongmany, PhD candidate (JV): UTS is increasingly becoming an inter-disciplinary practice, and the UTS administration really does help me in giving opportunities for identifying what classes could really help me reach these interdisciplinary skills that I really need.
Dr Phillip Newton, Director of Research Students (PN): We offer dual and joint PhDs with some of our key technology partners.  These partners are international universities and this makes our students more attractive on the international market once they’ve completed their degree.
LS: We’ve been rated ERA 5 in Nursing, Midwifery and Sports and Exercise Science in the last 2 ERA rounds reflecting the international standard of our research.
JV: I chose UTS:Health because another PhD student over here had told me how supportive UTS was in helping out their UTS students and also for the calibre of the supervisors here in making me the best researcher possible and I can really tell how passionate and sincere they are when they are training me.
Dr Caleb Ferguson, PhD graduate (CF): I was really fortunate to have quite a collaborative and supportive supervisory panel.  I had two post-doc fellows, a professor and a cardiologist on my panel and they really complimented each other with their skills.  I would go to see the post doc fellows for day-to-day support to do with my trial in the hospital setting and I had access to the cardiologists.  And then the Professor would provide more strategic support in terms of writing and conceptually putting everything together which was really important.
LS: We are traditionally very strong in the nursing and midwifery space and sports and exercise science have joined health in the last 5 years and that area focuses on elite athletes to some extent and training and is a highly specialised area.  Nursing we’ve done a lot of work around workforce, around primary healthcare and ofcourse around education.  In Midwifery we have an international leading centre, the centre for Midwifery, Child and Family Health which has been instrumental in both advances around design of birthing suites as well as doing a lot of work internationally in the development of midwifery in developing countries.
PN: Our academics have key relationships with healthcare organisations and internationally recognised sporting clubs and institutions – this gives our students the opportunity to be embedded with these partners during their PhDs but also gives them the opportunity to take up positions with them after completing their PhDs.
Dessi Wanda, PhD candidate (DW): I’ve built international networks with my supervisors and also other research students here at UTS so definitely I will have a future collaboration with them.
CF: The UTS Careers service is amazing and they offer a lot of support in terms of say – applying for different fellowships and appointments with industry in terms of research consultancy, employment for other different sorts of research positions as well.
LS: There are two exciting initiatives in 2016.  The first is the Faculty of Health is introducing a Master of Public Health and with that we’ll be having a doctorate in Public Health. This is allowing us to formally expand into public health and to bring the UTS way into research and into teaching and learning into that space and this is a very exciting initiative.  Secondly, UTS is part of the Athena Swann national pilot looking at women in science.  UTS is playing a pivotal part in looking at how we can enhance the careers of women in science and in health.
UTS have been top rated in NSW  for Nursing, Midwifery, Human Movement and Sports Science research in the Federal Government's ERA review (rated as ""5/5"" - well above world standard) and Public Health and Health Services (rated as ""4/5"" above world standard). The Faculty of Health has interdisciplinary research expertise in nursing, midwifery, complementary medicine, public health, child and family health, and health services management.
Our teaching and learning is centered on our unique learning futures framework, which encourages an active learning approach and results in Graduate Attributes that are highly sought after by employers.
The learning futures focus of the 2016 VC’s Learning and Teaching Grant scheme builds on the work undertaken by the 2015 grant recipients and the learning.futures fellows to promote innovation in learning.
The Faculty recently celebrated the success of a number of academics who received an award and citations in the 2016 Vice-Chancellors Learning and Teaching Awards."

Below is Professor Andrew Mowbray (Professor of Law and Information Technology and Director, AustLII) who co-founded the Australasian Legal Information Institute (AustLII), a joint research initiative of the Law Faculties of UTS and UNSW. Based on research funded by 25 ARC grants, plus contributions and research contracts from industry and other organisations, AustLII provides the national free access legal database, used by the legal profession, government, courts, education institutions and the public.
Transcript for video ""UTS Vice-Chancellor's Research Awards 2015 - Andrew Mowbray""
AUSTLII produces the Australian legal database. This is used by everyone from lawyers through to members of the public. It receives approximately 650,000 hits a day, which constitutes about 30 per cent of legal internet traffic in Australia.
AUSTLII tries to have impact both in a policy sense and in a sense of providing just general access to legal materials. From a policy point of view, we feel very strongly that the public has a right to be able to access legal information, but we also have impact in terms of the detail as to how that happens. We do this both in Australia and we try to help international. You know, AUSTLII has helped to establish an organisation called the Free Access to Law movement, which has 50 organisations as members around the world.
One of the fundamental things about AUSTLII is that we believe strongly that the public ought to have free access to legal information. We believe that ignorance of the law is no excuse, so it’s a good idea that the public can genuinely access what the law is. We also attempt to have impact in terms of the detail of how that happens – citation issues, issues as to how you can reliably prove that something’s correct and the like. 
 
Dr Thalia Anthony (Senior Lecturer, Faculty of Law, UTS) has made outstanding contributions to Indigenous legal research and translation of this research into classroom, online and experienced-based learning activities. Signifiers of this integration of her research into teaching are her publications on Indigenous legal education and leadership in international networks which incorporate Indigenous research in legal education.
Transcript for video ""UTS Vice-Chancellor's Research Awards 2015 - Thalia Anthony""
A strong aspect of my research is how we can enhance legal education to promote cultural competencies among our students, and I’ve held a number of conferences and published in this area to identify ways in which we can communicate Indigenous experiences through our teaching in the same way that I do it through my research. And I’ve been doing this in criminal law, but also through the design of new subjects like a Jumbunna editorial role, where students are actively involved in editing a Jumbunna law journal and being part of its production and communicating with stakeholders to enhance their professional capacity for working with Indigenous communities.
Students from these subjects, both the core subject of criminal law as well as the elective subjects of the Jumbunna journal and Indigenous People and the Law, which I teach and design, have gone on to work in Aboriginal legal services, native title services, as well as gone on to contribute to their Indigenous communities, not only in leadership roles, which they have contributed to, but also in very different ways, like artistic roles. So I think the function of the subjects and the way in which I’ve tried to incorporate Indigenous world views has had a profound effect on empowering Indigenous students as well as opening up non-Indigenous students to possibilities to contribute to Indigenous justice.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/teaching-and-research-integration/faculty-science,"At UTS, we believe science is not just a field of study, it's a philosophy and way of viewing the world.
Scientists are critical thinkers, using evidence to explain how the universe, the world and life work. As such, our teaching practices are informed by the research being undertaken by our academics - ensuring that we are developing the next generation of critical thinkers.
At UTS, we have six research theme areas, spanning the environment, communication and intelligent systems to future services, industry and productivity. Science disciplines cut across each of these areas and we are proud of our world-leading research in climate change, environmental sustainability, medical science, forensics, nanoscale technology and many more.
Science is a process of discovery, creation, and innovation, and problem solving. To ensure our students are equipped to help solve global problems, our graduates are able to demonstrate a range of research, scientific discipline, and enterprise skills that will increase their employability and ensure the scientific skills they develop can serve across society. By focusing on research and teaching integration, we expose our students to current issues impacting Australia and beyond, instil inquisitiveness and inspire an interest in lifelong learning. Alongside this, our research engages with industry and community to deliver real impact and benefit.
The following institutes and centres are recognised leaders in their areas. These are contemporary research priorities that impact on everyday life.
Centre for Health Technologies
UTS Science Students learn from research experts drawn from UTS research strengths to infuse core curricula with a research-inspired learning environment. UTS Science programs include industry co-designed and co-delivered classes, as well as assessments that are modelled on the current practices of modern workplaces and research environments.
UTS Science students have the opportunities to learning a Superlab and the HIVE Superlab. These are world leading facilities that are equipped with the latest technologies and equipment that is used in research and industry.

https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/uts-model-learning/what-students-learn,"The UTS Model of Learning guides what our students learn.  A framework for practice-oriented learning and teaching at UTS, it guides how we design curriculum and links to the development of graduate attributes – essentially, what we want our students to become.  The UTS Model of Learning has three distinctive features, or themes, that are interrelated in our students' practice-oriented learning experience:
Practice-oriented education is more than just preparing students to secure a job on graduation. At UTS, we prepare students to work long-term in a dynamic and changing professional environment. Students gain exposure to professional practice throughout their degree through experiences such as:
Graduates live and work in a culturally diverse and internationalised world. Many will work with groups in which cross-cultural communication and cultural safety will be important, they may work in organisations where international travel and global interaction is standard. UTS itself is home to students from more than 130 different language backgrounds, as well as a culturally diverse staff.  
The development of international and intercultural capabilities will be critical for our graduates' future as professionals and citizens, and we are committed to ensuring they build these capabilities. Students can build these capabilities through opportunities such as:
Although some disciplines vary more than others across cultures and there will be variation in approaches to international and intercultural engagement, all students develop the capability to work in culturally diverse environments.
Research-inspired learning connects learning and teaching with research and inquiry. Active engagement with research methods and outcomes can provide students with the critical thinking, enquiry, creative and analytical capabilities that will help our students to become lifelong learners in a continually transforming world. 
Healey and Jenkins (2009) distinguish four ways of involving students with research. Students should:
Involving students as recipients of research ensures that what they learn is academically rigorous and reflects the current state of knowledge in the discipline. Teachers who develop inquiry-led methods can inspire students with their enthusiasm, model ways in which knowledge is generated and show students the diverse range of research that is happening in their university.
If the UTS Model of Learning defines what students learn, the learning.futures strategy guides how students learn. Learning.futures champions future-focused curriculum with informed technology use. The UTS learning.futures strategy both guides and promotes an approach to learning design that places UTS students at the centre of the creative learning experience. Find out more"
