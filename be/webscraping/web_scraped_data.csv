https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/your-enrolment/enrolling-subjects,"YOU CAN NOW BUILD AND MANAGE YOUR TIMETABLE FOR THE REST OF 2023You can now allocate your subject activities (such as lectures and tutorials) for the rest of the year, via MyTimetable. If you still need to enrol in subjects for this year, enrol now for all sessions via My Student Admin (before you select your timetable and allocate your classes).If you are having trouble enroling in your subjects, check out our 'How to enrol in subjects' video or our recorded Enrolment & Timetabling webinar. 
SPRING 2023 - RETURN TO CAMPUSIn 2023, we have returned to more face-to-face classes, social activities and student services and from Spring session 2023, most subject activities will run in-person and on campus.   In accordance with TEQSA (the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency of the Australian Government), all students will need to be back on campus for the start of Spring session. TEQSA expects that all providers (including UTS) will meet the requirements of the ESOS Compliance Policy by 30 June 2023. 
You must be formally enrolled in a subject to complete it.
Subjects can fill up quickly, so enrol in subjects as soon as enrolment opens for you.
If you’re new to your course, enrol as soon as you accept your offer. For more info, see commencing students.
If enrolment is not yet open, check the Principal Dates page to confirm when enrolment will open for your course. We recommend enrolling in subjects as soon enrolment is open. 
When re-enrolment opens for you depends on your course:
Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences
Faculty of Design, Architecture and Building
Faculty of Health
Other areas
Business School
Faculty of Science
Transdisciplinary Innovation
Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology
Faculty of Law
 
Before you enrol in subjects, take some time to: 
Look at your course structure, recommended sequence and completion requirements in the UTS Handbook so you know which subjects you need to enrol in (use the handbook from the year that you started your course).
If you course has electives or majors, use the UTS Handbook to research the kind of subjects you want to do as electives or subjects you need to do for your chosen major.
Less than a full-time study load may affect your course duration and currency of knowledge when you graduate, Centrelink payments, travel concession, scholarship, and student visa requirements (international students only).
Make sure you enrol in subjects for all sessions:
If your plans change later, you can make changes to your enrolment, keeping in mind the following important dates: 
To enrol in subjects, log in to My Student Admin:
You can also follow the video below: 
Hi everyone. In this video, I will show you how to enrol in subjects and choose your major. Let’s get started! 
Go to your My Student Admin, log in with your student ID and password, once you log in, you will see this home page. Click on your Subjects tab.
And you will see your currently enrolled subjects. In this example, we’re going to enrol in subjects for the following year. 
Firstly, click on Enrol in subject, save the declaration form, and it will take you to your study plan page.   
 
If you can’t find any subjects to enrol like in this example, don’t worry. Most of the time, you just need to add your major or elective subjects on your study plan and your subjects will appear here.  
If you are not sure about which subject to enrol, or what major or stream you want to do, you can click on Course program to view the structure of your degree in the UTS Handbook.  
In this example, you can view the second year subjects and the sequences here. 
Okay, let’s go back to the study plan.  
To add a major or subject, please click on Choose button.
These are the options you can choose from.  Decide which one to do, and click on Add to Study Planner. You can confirm the details of the major or subjects on the right.  
 
Please note that, depending on your course, once you save anything to your study plan, you may not be able to change them, so be careful and do your research on the UTS Handbook before saving.  
 
If you are okay with the option you selected, click on Save to Study Plan.
Now your new major and subjects are on your study plan!
 Subjects showing Enrol are available for enrolment.  
 
Subjects with a Planned status are NOT available for selection. It means either the subject is full, not offered, or you don’t currently meet its pre-requisites. You can check why it’s not available by clicking on Unavailable, or Requisites information link. 
 
If you have been following the recommended subject sequence, but the subject you need to enrol into is a core subject and full, send an eRequest to the Student Centre for further assistance. 
Okay, let’s select and enrol in subjects.
Check the tick box Enrol for the subject you wish to enrol into. This will highlight the subject in yellow. 
 
If the subject is running in more than one session, like this one, it will display a drop down of available sessions. Select the session you wish to take the subject. 
 
When only one availability is appearing, it means the subject is only available in the specific session, or other sessions are already full. 
 
You may see both Block and Internal modes come up. The internal mode means it is a standard mode subject, and the subject is offered throughout the semester. The block mode means it is an intensive study mode and normally offered within a shorter period.   
 
When you have chosen your subjects for enrolment, click Enrol to continue the process.
 Any selected subjects without issues will appear in yellow, but if there is any error, the system will give you a reason why you can’t enrol in it. 
 
In this example, you don’t currently meet the pre-requisites. 
 
Once you confirm the potential enrolment list, click on Confirm enrolment button. 
Alright, now you’re enrolled! 
 
Repeat this process and complete your enrolment as per the recommended structure in the handbook.  
 
We also strongly recommend you to enrol for the whole year, including both Autumn and Spring sessions. For example, If you leave the Spring enrolment late, many subjects may become full and you may not be able to choose a subject you want. 
For more information, please visit the Enrolling in subjects page on the UTS website, or contact UTS Student Centre.
 
Before you build your timetable, you’ll need to enrol in subjects for all sessions.
