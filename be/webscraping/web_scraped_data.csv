https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/short-courses/uts-institute-data-intensive-courses/institute-data-learner-perspectives,"Airline Pilot – Dominique Cotte successfully transitioned her career during COVID-19 to the cyber security industry by becoming trained through our part-time cyber security program. Prior to pursuing studies with the Institute of Data, I was an International wide-body jet pilot for Emirates Airline – 4 years on Boeing 777. I’ve also flown for Tigerair Australia. My career over the past 17 years has been in the aviation industry. In terms of prior qualifications, I have a bachelor’s in aviation technology from Swinburn Hawthorn. I was introduced to IoD’s Cybersecurity program through my sister actually – she is a travel agent for cricket in Australia who recommended it to me. I thought it was a great transition from aviation especially due to my experiences in risk management, threat & error management, and critical thinking ability. In addition, my previous focus on international standards, regulation and safety management was very helpful in my career transition. I was always interested in moving into coding or studying another career path alongside my aviation career. The pandemic consolidated my need for this. Cybersecurity was also thriving during the pandemic! There were so many jobs becoming available worldwide, revealing a great opportunity for myself and many others I did find that my lack of IT and cyber past experience was a challenge. I had great practical knowledge gained from the Institute of Data program, however for a few months, I was rejected and did not have any interview opportunities. My breakthrough was when I personally reached out to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of Qantas. We established a great relationship over time and she provided me guidance and insight into how I could position myself better in job application from the perspective of a Cyber Security professional. Due to this, I did land the opportunity with QBE. It definitely helps having the right connections. What is also important is being open & proactive to receiving guidance from professionals who can help you find a job in the industry. There are numerous ways individuals can prepare for a Cyber Security interview. Here are a few tips that I would suggest: Learn more and explore roles in cyber security here and here. It has been a humbling experience starting a completely new career. I have had to develop skill sets I haven’t used in some time and face new challenges. I’ve realised there is a lot of room to grow and develop within Cybersecurity. With hard work, I’m determined and driven to learn as much as I can. I definitely have a better work/life balance compared to my time working as an airline pilot. Now, I can come home, spend time with friends and family far more often and have more stability in my life. My capstone project was focused on a suggestion my lead trainer gave me. It was suggested for me to base my project around something that I wanted to work in – for me, I wanted to work in risk. I really enjoyed the process – it honestly surprised me how much I had learned about the topic from the moment I started to the moment I presented it in class. It was a great opportunity to hone my studies in an area I was motivated in. It also made my capstone project far more interesting. The program gave me far more clarity and understanding about the industry, where Cybersecurity is heading in the future and modern day threats associated with technology advances. It also gave me a great insight into where my strengths lie and how I could utilise my strengths in the Cyber Security space. The program also taught me how to develop and learn the required practical skills for the job. Many of the technical and interpersonal skills that were taught to me were actually very applicable and relevant. I enjoyed the challenge of learning and up-skilling especially as a mature age student. I learned so much from my counterparts, and loved the community we created throughout the program. I felt supported by our trainers and learned so much. They put in extra time to support each one of us throughout the course which I am very grateful for. Their guidance allowed me to understand every component of the program as we progressed. If you are interested in up-skilling and landing a role in the Cyber Security industry, book a consultation with a Data Industry Career Consultant today. The travel industry sadly ground to a halt with the onslaught of COVID19. I saw the fast-growing cyber security industry offering an exciting, interesting and challenging work scape so I made the pivot. Cybersecurity has a skills shortage and needs diversity in professionals who can bring open-mindedness, unique thinking and experiences as well as much needed soft skills to bring cyber awareness out of the basement and into the board room. What I’ve enjoyed the most is seeing where business goals and cybersecurity intersect to support risk strategies and enable businesses to grow with confidence. My trainer Michael is instrumental in bringing real world experiences to the classroom, helping me to see past the theory and into the office with everything I’ve learned. I’m excited and grateful for the opportunity to join Triskele Labs. I began looking at cybersecurity jobs when I started the course. My advice is, don’t wait until you’re finished. When I decide to pursue something, there’s no looking back - no hesitation, just discovery, delivery and drive. I made the effort to ask lots of questions and unpack all the areas of cybersecurity. I began to see where my strengths and experiences leant best. When I started applying for jobs and had discussions with people in the industry, I became aware of the difficulty to break into cyber security. For all that there’s a skills shortage and our industry’s in need, it’s a challenging one to start out in. I believe in living for your work and not working to live.... To join the cyber industry, you need to push yourself to get a foot in the door and craft how you can grow and pivot. My advice to anyone joining the industry is; before you know what you want to do, you need to know who you are. Start with that - define who you are, let that grow into who you want to be. From there, you can start to answer where you want to be in your professional life. It’s a lot easier to pinpoint the how from there. Be ready to shift your perceptions and assumptions. The industry has opportunities for people from all sorts of backgrounds. Wherever you’re coming from, you need to be able to break down what you’re good at into key components and demonstrate how they are relatable, transferable or complementary to the cybersecurity industry. Be self-aware to know how to deliver. Lastly, talk to as many cybersecurity folks as you can. Network, connect and have conversations. The greatest thing to propel you in the industry will be your peers. No amount of qualifications, hours or skills will make you better than someone who can develop great relationships. It’s all about Level of Preparation. Dial it up to 11. Off the chart. If you don’t feel over prepared, you’re not ready. Make sure you can articulate your story. Have a clear understanding of who you are, what you want, why you want it, where you’re going, what you can contribute and what you’re willing to do to make it work. Know as much about your prospective employer, company and its staff as you can. You need to know who you are interviewing for. I make sure I’m interviewing the employer as well. They need to be the right fit for me too. In line with who I am, supportive of my ambition and direction as well as share a mutual belief of possibilities. Enrol in the Institute of Data cyber program with UTS today. But be open minded, round out your learning- make it interactive, structured, self-driven and connected. Build solid relationships with peers and other professionals. Always be clear on your intentions. Someone will be willing to help if you can demonstrate a desire to help yourself. Six months ago, all I saw was the crash-landing travel industry. Now, I see more possibilities than ever before. One of the exciting things about the beginning of this journey is that there’s such an incredible opportunity to learn, grow and move within the cyber industry. From roles that are super technical, to people focused and everything in between. The course validated there isn’t a pre-requisite amount of technical skill to start your cyber journey. One thing increasingly clear is that there is not a ‘type’, ‘one best way’ or ‘one size fits all’ for what’s required. Curiosity goes a long way. Be ready to work really hard and know there’s a great reward in doing so. If you are interested in up-skilling and landing a role in the Cyber Security industry, book a consultation with a Data Industry Career Consultant today. My career background is predominantly in the IT space – as a COBOL developer and application development team leader & manager. I have been self employed for a few years prior to up-skilling with this program – running my own business on Amazon and publishing books over the years. I do also have a diploma in management – PMP (PMI). Prior to up-skilling, I didn’t have any concrete career goals. I was working for myself for some time and was more aiming for a change in my career path – hence why I transitioned my career. The reason why I chose the part-time program is because I had other commitments that did clash with the full-time program, it allowed me to balance everything in my life easier. Part-time class hours suited my schedule better. In hindsight, I could have stretched myself to complete the full-time course though. I landed the new role through many, many applications, sending emails with expressions of interest, contacting local MPs, and even contacting previous employers from Ireland. It was through my own hard efforts as well as the practical skills & careers guidance that I was able to land the position at the end of the day. I sent an EOI for a role that I actually didn’t qualify for – they wanted an Australian citizenship which I don’t have. I did mention this in my letter. Thankfully, they actually had other positions in the company that didn’t need citizenship! It was a great learning experience because it made me realise I need to be creative, not be blinkered in what I’m applying for, and focus on the roles and/or companies that I’d like to work for – not just the role. That would be what I would suggest to other people who are applying for cybersecurity positions. I am way better off! I’m employed now, previously was not employed. I’m really loving my experience with the company and looking forward to growing in my new sphere of experience over the next 6-12 months. One thing I wish I knew before changing careers to cyber was how vast the industry is! It may have helped if I had narrowed down where I did want to land-up in. My particular project was difficult because there was very little documentation on SD. I managed to get the proof on concept, load all the existing rules, and execute various tests. However, without the documentation available, I could not find specifically how the rules were interpreted or worked. It taught me that some tools are not necessarily the be-all-and-end-all. If one doesn’t fit the bill, then try others. Time constraints in my case, prevented that. I gained valuable presentation and reporting skills out of the project. I enjoyed the scope of areas the program covered, and therefore the variety of skills to learn. I also enjoyed being in a position to learn as much as I can to protect myself and others from potential cyber attacks.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/engineering/courses/electrical-and-data-science-engineering-majors/meet-dhruv-electrical-engineering-student,"Electricity powers the world around us and is core to the future of engineering and technology. Taking inspiration from a Year 9 Electrical elective, Dhruv chose to major in Electrical Engineering to future-proof his career opportunities through practical and hands-on learning and contribute to our changing world. Dhruv’s journey to engineering was ignited by his curiosity to this field at a young age. “My dad is an engineer. I was always interested to learn what he did at work”. Whilst he was certain about studying engineering, Dhruv was unsure about which major he would pursue. However, Dhruv recalled studying an electrical subject in Year 9 as an elective. “I really enjoyed that subject and its practical element such as making circuits, and I was really looking for that hands-on approach to study when considering my major”. Dhruv also felt that Electrical Engineering was a future-focused major and would set him up for success. ""Technology moves at such a rapid pace, but electricity is always at centre of technology and powers the world around us. It is crucial to so many elements of our society, and I felt Electrical Engineering would also give me a variety of career opportunities to explore in the future.” Dhruv also decided to study a business management degree together with his engineering degree with the hope that he would be set up for a future in management. He believed that the dual-degree approach would enhance his skill set preparing him for various roles in the future. Engineering Undergraduate Courses Guide (PDF, 7.2MB) When choosing UTS for his Electronic Engineering major, Dhruv was drawn to the hands-on and practical approach on campus. “I like being challenged to think differently, and I get the freedom to do that in my engineering subjects. We also get access to some great facilities like the UTS Robotics Institute where I get to experience real-life working equipment that I wouldn’t get anywhere else”. In 2nd year, Dhruv worked with other engineering students for the UTS Rover Team project that saw him design rovers to be launched on the moon. “It was so cool to be a part of something space-related that combined so well with my degree. We got to use some really high-end equipment that I would have otherwise not had the chance to experience”. In his third year, Dhruv joined the UTS Aerospace Society where he took part in the Spaghetti and Space launch project that involved building a high altitude balloon that travelled 25kms into space with a plate of spaghetti. “It was such a great project and received so much attention across Australia. It felt like a fever dream!”. Having taken part in these experiences, Dhruv believes they have helped complement his skills learnt within his studies and explore different facets of engineering. I really love UTS’ hands-on and collaborative approach to learning. It makes so much sense, especially during excursions or when working on practical projects through the students’ clubs and societies. ""I also appreciate the university’s willingness to employ students on campus through the Student Promotional Representatives (SPROUT) program which I am a part of where we can inspire other potential students to study degrees like Electrical Engineering that they may not have considered.” As a part of his Electrical Engineering major, Dhruv has had the chance to gain industry exposure and make connections through internships. “I am interning for Alstom, who work closely on the Sydney Light Rail and Sydney Metro projects. I am specifically working on the Sydney Trains project”. Working with a close team of experienced Engineers, Dhruv has received practical experience and is able to contribute to real-world projects that keep the Sydney rail network running. ""I have physically contributed to the traction maintenance of the Millenium fleet commissioned in the early 2000s working with a close team of experienced engineers. I’m involved in the repairs and get the chance to work on projects that are meaningful. Dhruv believes that engineering enthusiasts should explore their passion, and not be afraid to explore their options. It’s a common misconception that Electrical Engineering is very difficult and math-heavy. Don’t just rule out a major because you’ve heard that it’s difficult. If you have a passion for it and are looking for solid graduate opportunities and a community to be a part of, Electrical Engineering is a great major to pursue. Dhruv attributes his academic journey’s success to his ability to be involved in extracurricular projects. “I would say be as productive and proactive as possible in your degree. Try as many things as possible and find your niche”. The Electrical Engineering major is offered to undergraduate students and can be paired with an Engineering degree.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/engineering/courses/electrical-and-data-science-engineering-majors/meet-palvi-data-science-engineering-student,"Although her high school journey was mostly humanities-focused, Palvi was excited to launch herself Data Science degree at UTS that pushed her outside of her comfort zone. “Simply put, the challenging aspect has been the best.” Engineering Undergraduate Courses Guide (PDF, 7.2MB) When Palvi was in her final year of school, she felt as if her friends had their study path figured out. “I didn’t really know what I wanted to study for a long time. I’ve always felt that I’ve been an all-rounder in school and took that open-minded approach into making a decision on a degree”. Palvi took a process of elimination approach to land on her Data Science Engineering degree. “I had to force myself to explore the courses available as applications at universities were about to close. I read course guides as I tried to identify which course would suit the subjects I was passionate about being math and physics. I stumbled upon Engineering as my core degree” When picking her major, Palvi came across Data Science Engineering. Despite not knowing much about the major, she knew she was up for a challenge and decided to research further on what it involved. “Further research on this major made me appreciate the growing nature of data engineering. I hadn’t heard much exposure to anything related to my major in the past, but I felt that the field was growing and it was very future-focused which grabbed my attention”. Despite lacking prior technical knowledge, Palvi embraced the opportunity to study technology in a completely unfamiliar domain. “We were not offered ""techy"" kind of subjects at school; we were very humanities-based. So, everything I studied from the first semester at uni was new to me. But I love a challenge and I get the best feeling out of it in the end.” When asked how she would explain Data Science Engineering to someone with no prior knowledge of it, Palvi assures that it’s simpler than it sounds. Everything around us in the world is built or affected by data. It’s everywhere, and it has the potential to make a difference in the world. Data Science Engineering involves creating and managing systems to service the data in our world. It’s all about leveraging the power and potential data has to make a difference. Palvi is currently interning at Woolworths Group. The opportunities not only enhanced her knowledge but also helped to refine her career aspirations. “Internships are such fantastic ways to build your skills both in technical and non-technical aspects. I found that my internships allowed me to work in areas of Data Science Engineering that I wouldn’t have otherwise pursued. It’s a benefit that not many people talk about, but it means I don’t have any unchartered career territories within the industry”. Participating in mentorship programs, like the Lucy Mentoring program, also highlighted a proactive approach to seeking guidance and insights from experienced professionals. These interactions also enabled her to see the importance of promoting gender diversity in traditionally male-dominated fields like engineering. The Lucy Mentoring Program has allowed me to connect with so many like-minded women from different Engineering backgrounds. It’s provided me with perspective. Palvi is also a Women in Engineering and IT Co-Operative Scholarship recipient and explains this achievement as life-changing as it provided her with more opportunities to network, and grow her confidence in this field. “Data Science Engineering is such an amazing study path for what it is. Having the scholarship awarded on top of that has presented me with even more opportunities to network, but mostly the growth in my confidence since the start of my journey has been astronomical”. Palvi says the most surprising part of her degree was that she didn’t feel she needed to have any prior knowledge in Data Science Engineering to succeed. “There’s a beauty to learning as you go. How hard can it be if you don’t ever try it out? Don’t feel you need to over-prepare for the unknown. The learning curve is real, but it’s rewarding when you get to the top”. Palvi also credits her study experience to her ability to push herself enough to take on the opportunities that come her way. “You will gain more if you learn to embrace opportunities that come your way. I would tell my younger self the same advice because that is how you grow outside your comfort zone. Everything will work out if you put in the effort and stay in the present.” The Data Science Engineering major is offered to undergraduate students and can be paired with an Engineering degree.

https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/short-courses/why-short-courses/5-tech-trends-2024,"Even as new technologies are developed, innovation around the application of existing technology is rapidly changing how organisations operate and how we interact with the world. Leaps in computing capacity, data capture and connectivity are accelerating this change. Here are five areas to watch in 2024 and beyond… AI is about machines with human attributes - speaking, reading, seeing and even recognising emotion - completing tasks while also ""learning"" from repeated interactions. Using algorithms that adapt to location, speech or user-history machines can perform tasks that are dangerous or tedious, more accurately or much faster than humans. Within a few years, analysts predict that all software will use AI at some level, according to US research and advisory firm Gartner. Importantly AI offers the opportunity to continuously tailor products and services providing a competitive advantage over rivals that is not easily copied. The question to ask is 'how can AI help my organisation? Systems that combine real-time 3D vision, sound, haptics (the sense of touch), location data and even other senses such as smell enable people to immerse themselves somewhere else, react to what's around them and alter their virtual environment in real-time. Organisations are increasingly applying this technology across a wide spectrum of human activity from art and entertainment to commerce, education and the military. It's used to train doctors, nurses, teachers and police officers and will soon be available on your smart device. Could you use AR to lift efficiency for your internal stakeholders or help you communicate with your customer base? The fortunes of digital currency Bitcoin have drawn public attention to Blockchain technology, but this secure system for recording and verifying transactions and storing trusted records has the potential to disrupt enterprises of many kinds. Companies are using Blockchain technology to transform time-consuming, centralised, less reliable and less secure systems. Digital democracy platform MyVote, for example, uses Blockchain to store users' personal data and voting history to give citizens a more direct voice in the political process. Could you use Blockchain to keep your data secure? Robots in manufacturing go back to the 1960s. Now it's the scale and breadth of the transformation that automated systems make possible, as a result of other advances in machine learning and connectivity, for example, that puts automation firmly at the forefront of technology trends. From convenient devices at home to industrial applications on a massive scale, automation will be a key focus of technological change, with potentially far-reaching economic and social consequences. Currently, professional services such as the legal and finance industry are being disrupted by automation with feedback from these sectors being that core technical skills, together with management and people skills are more important than ever. How will automation disrupt your industry? Gartner calls the combination of technologies and the connection of people, devices, content and services the ""intelligent digital mesh."" This is the foundation for new business models, platforms and possibilities that will transform how we live and work with implications that go far beyond the technology itself and involve disciplines such as law, economics, business and politics. It is early days for the application of IoT strategy, but it is clear that opportunities will exist for those with the technical knowledge to connect platforms as well as those with the data analytics skills to utilise the rich stream of information generated by IoT applications. What could you learn from connecting and analysing the data from your products or elements of your core operations? During a postgraduate degree at UTS, you'll develop the characteristics to help you be agile, look for opportunities to innovate and disrupt and be an effective project manager. You'll also have the opportunity to build technology expertise such as in data analytics, according to your interest.

https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/animal-logic-academy/animal-logic-academy-courses/choose-specialisation,"If you've ever wondered how the big studios like Disney, Pixar and Animal Logic go about creating high-end 3D animated feature films like ‘Happy Feet’, ‘The Lego Movies’, ‘Super Pets’ and more, enjoy this crash-course from the Leads at the UTS Animal Logic Academy as they step you through the various roles it takes to make a studio-quality 3D animated film. It takes a lot more than just animators to make a 3D animated film. From story and art department, through modelling, rigging, animation, surfacing, effects, lighting, compositing, production and technical directing, hear about what each of these roles brings to each production, based on our most recent 3D animated short film ‘Apart’. These are all roles we are looking for when recruiting for the Master of Animation and Visualisation each year at the University of Technology Sydney. So if you would like to move from being a student, to becoming a specialist and landing a dedicated role in an animation or visual effects studio, consider joining our team of incredibly talented students in next years masters course. It’s essential at undergraduate level that students develop broad knowledge and skill, but how do you translate these skills to a professional working environment? Here at the Academy we teach students at a postgraduate level so that they can further develop specialised skills in order to contribute at a high level to complex projects, and also to accelerate their entry and progression in industry. Here are some of the key areas students can choose to specialise in as part of the production process when undertaking the Master of Animation and Visualisation. The Art department starts with the original story idea then creates the visual look of the project. The Modelling team takes designs and creates the characters, creatures, objects and assets as 3-dimensional computer models. Riggers create an interactive skeleton with integrated controls for models that enables them to be animated. Previz/Layout artists take the first raw elements from art department and animation, and create basic moving shots, including decisions about framing, lensing and camera movement. Animation is the creation of performance from rigged models. Great animators typically have a strong understanding of gesturing, theatrics and performance. Detailed texture and pattern artworks are produced to warp perfectly around 3D models to create the right photo-realistic or stylised look for each asset. FX simulations are special effects that enhance shots and scenes, such as fire, explosions, dust, steam, sparks, or even fur or cloth simulations, crowds or cities. Lighting artists set detailed light sources to each shot to highlight the action, characters and emotion through the use of highlights and shadows. Compositing is the process of combining all the various elements of the production into one final composited scene. Production Coordinators ensure the project runs to schedule. It’s a great role for those who envision themselves in a project management or producer role. Technical Directors are responsible for creating tools and maintaining the software and pipeline for the production of the animation and/or visual effects projects.

https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/short-courses/why-short-courses/top-skills-employers-are-looking,"Here are the four skills our industry partners are on the lookout for in new hires! Students collaborating. Image: Toby Burrows According to Chris Messina, who invented the idea of using hashtags, this means you're an agile employee who confidently navigates the technological landscape and understands the crossover between visual design (the look and feel), and interaction design (how the look and feel work). Facing an overload of data, you can weed out relevance. You have specific expertise and yet you're abreast of other areas in the organisation. You embrace unfamiliar situations. You understand algorithms and coding, and you get what GitHub and StackOverflow mean. Self-sufficient and independent, you're always searching for best practices and improved productivity. You thrive on group collaboration and excel as part of a team. Learning from the start-up scene, many corporations are investing time and money to foster ""intrapreneurship"". Apple, Sony, 3M, ING Direct, Coca-Cola, IBM, and Allianz are among many companies with innovation divisions. You may choose to dive into this type of role, with the passion and permission to disrupt an organisation from within. A memorable example of intrapreneurship is Google. The company encourages employees to spend 20 percent of their time working on ""what they think will most benefit Google"". This led to employees developing Google News, Gmail and AdSense. According to Jeff Collins, president of the Dallas-based Innovative Management Solutions, to be a project manager communication skills are the key characteristic you need. You'll know how to share your clear vision and important information with team members so they buy into the project's goals and purpose. Also, you'll display confidence, positivity and enthusiasm for the project while remaining level-headed and composed, embracing problems and leading by example. You'll delegate responsibilities and tasks, giving team members a chance to thrive and grow while not micromanaging their progress. Big data is growing rapidly and many companies struggle to keep up. Knowing how to extract data, analyse it and look for patterns are skills that can improve the use of resources, value chains, managerial operations, industry knowledge and growth opportunities. Data analysts are in big demand across all sectors. International research and advisory firm Forrester also predicts a significant rise in companies hiring Chief Data Officers. Businesses need them across their operations, including finance, human resources and marketing. During your postgraduate degree at UTS, you'll develop the characteristics to help you be agile, look for opportunities to innovate and disrupt and be an effective project manager. You'll also have the opportunity to build technology expertise such as in data analytics according to your interest.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/engineering/courses/summer-studios/global-aerospace-challenge,"​​​​​​​Using space technology to improve life on earth. A trip to Adelaide to witness a meeting of the world’s top minds in the field of space at the International Astronautical Congress, proved to be the inspiration behind the UTS Faculty of Engineering & IT Summer Studio - Global Aerospace Challenge led by fourth-year student, Gavan Huang. “I think UTS has the right mindset when it comes to experiential learning and this is a point of difference when you choose to study here,” he said. “Senior staff are accessible and open to students pitching their ideas which is a big plus when trying to get new initiatives off the ground.” Gavan’s first step was to introduce the idea of a space subject to the Faculty’s Learning and Development team. This was met with a positive response together with the suggestion to test the waters at the UTS Summer Studio and so the Global Aerospace Challenge was born. As Founder and President of the UTS Professional Aeronautics and Astronautics Society, Gavan is passionate about providing students with better access into the Australian Space Industry. Through the Global Aerospace Challenge, he hoped to debunk the myth of space being a difficult topic and introduce people to the concept of space entrepreneurship. “Students have the opportunity to work closely with industry stakeholders to build projects to solve problems the space industry faces today.” “It’s about looking at the problems that exist in the world and using space technology to solve it – then creating a scalable business model which can sustain your solution, such as: Gavan says the 10 participants kicked off their Global Aerospace Challenge by discussing their own space interests – from space colonisation to launch vehicles and asteroid mining. “I wanted to take all the best aspects of uni learning and combine them into one so that we could deliver an inspiring studio workshop,” he said. With the Australian Government announcing its intention to establish an Australian space agency, Gavan hopes the UTS Faculty of Engineering and IT is recognised as competitive in this field. “The success of the Global Aerospace Challenge and the introduction of space subjects to our mainstream curriculum is a positive step forward as we continue to work towards UTS students becoming the future leaders of the space industry.” UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/engineering/courses/summer-studios/vivid-summer-studio,"Lighting up the world one installation at a time When fourth-year student Seamus O’Sullivan first learned about the UTS Summer Studios he thought it would be a chance to take on a hobby project during the holidays. He was also familiar with the Vivid festival and liked the idea of being part of practical collaboration that would result in something tangible at the end. “With Vivid such a well-known event in Sydney, I thought the Vivid 2018 studio offered a cool opportunity to create something that I could relate to myself,” he said. This studio was dedicated to the delivery of an interactive light installation for the vivid light festival– but that’s all the students were told. The nine-strong team had to work closely together to research the entire project. “The best thing about the studio is that we were able to lead the design ourselves, but with plenty of support and technical expertise from our tutors when we needed it,” Seamus said. “We were responsible for all the decision-making as the project progressed and we got to learn a lot through this process.” “As well as great support from UTS tutors, you also get a chance to see what’s happening in other majors and get access to new facilities that you may not have needed to use before.” For Seamus this included using the new UTS ProtoSpace for 3D printing as well as the Fabrication Labs for laser cutting. Seamus says the studio offers a different experience to term time study where you follow a standard pathway to meet course requirements. With the studio you’re working on a real-world project tackling real-world challenges along the way, such as: Seamus says the result of the studio was a strong prototype and design concept that can be scaled up in the future – and the project continues to live on! “Our team has kept in touch and have the foundations to keep the momentum going on this project. The next step is to attract some funding and civil engineering expertise to the project so that we can have an installation ready for Vivid 2019 or 2020.” Transcript UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands.

So we're going to talk about COVID-19, and how that's affected our learning, ATARs, how we get into UTS and the different types of courses we have within the business school internships, opportunities, and international opportunities, and scholarships, as well. And I was sort of in a similar position to you, when I left high school, I was trying to figure out what university to go to - and I'm a UTS, graduate as well. So I did a Bachelor of Business. And then I did a PhD at the University of New South Wales. But I'm also registered as an Accountant, I have professional as well as academic experience. And we know that 2020 and 2021 is not what we wanted it to be, especially with our students and online learning. But our priority is the safety and well being of our staff and our students at this time. So right now our campus is closed. Students who need to access the campus for their learning can do so. But we're doing most of our activities remotely. And we've been working really hard over the last 18 months to provide engaging online experiences for students, and lots of support, in class time and outside of class time as well. So we have lots of specialists, online learning experts, one of those is myself. I am a 2020 National Teaching Award winner. So I was voted by my peers, as the best Academic in Australia in Business, Law and Economics in 2020. And part of that is the innovative approach that I bring to UTS and that I also pass on to all of my colleagues. So just know that we are able to shift and adjust quite quickly, even within one or two weeks notice of changes in situations. And we're always focused on giving students safe options for their learning. So how do you get into UTS, there is the traditional pathway of doing your HSC exams which are coming up, which have been extended or delayed until November 9 to get your ATAR, then there are extra points, games or adjustment points to create your selection rank that helps you get into UTS. And traditionally, this is probably one of the most common ways that students come into UTS. And if you studied any economics, the ATAR on the selection rank is simply of functionality of supply and demand. So these are the selection ranks for our 2021 intake. Bachelor of Business - 86 Full Time. Part time is slightly higher; we have because we have a slightly smaller part time intake. We've got Economics, our Management, and a Bachelor of Accounting oh and also Bachelor of Economics. The Bachelor of Accounting doesn't have an ATAR because it is an interview and assessment process. But we'll talk more about that later. Now, you might be thinking, oh gosh, I'm really stressed out about doing my HSC and I'm worried about sitting exams and having to wear a mask and you know my study time and your preparation has been certainly Through a huge process of upheaval, you would have had some of your learning in 2020, when you're in your 11 online, some on campus or live and some online again in 2021. There are also extra adjustment points or bonus points available depending on which subjects you're studying in your HSC and if you can get in the top one or two bands of those subjects, there are extra points to add to your ATAR. So if your ATAR was 80 and then you get top bands in some specific areas or the second band from the top, then you can get up to five extra ATAR points, which might be enough points to help you get into your program. And you can go to uts.edu.au/study-year-12-adjustment-factors or if you just search UTS adjustment factors ATAR, then you'll be able to find that information and look at what subjects you're doing and which ones can give you extra bonus points to add on to your ATAR. And you don't need to apply for this, we can see what subjects you've done. And if you've put us as your first preference, we will automatically look at those subjects and add the bonus points. Now another way to get bonus points, or a way to get into UTS is our cadetship scheme, I started as a cadet at what is now PriceWaterhouseCoopers. I was 18 going to university part time and working full time. So if you have been offered a cadetship or that type of traineeship program, then you might be able to get direct entry into UTS regardless of what your ATAR is. So you can apply for your cadetship after you've chosen your preferences in UAC. But when it comes time to receive an offer, you can write to us and then once we get to I think applications open today. But you'll be able to say look, here is my contract that I've signed with PwC, Ernst and Young, Grant Thornton as a trainee. And you there's a really strong possibility that that you'll be offered a place at UTS without needing to worry about that ATAR as well. This is because we recognize that UTS is a real heart of the business community. And we are the number one choice for students in cadetships and traineeships because of our proximity, our flexibility and our linkages to the workplace. And that's why I chose UTS probably, okay, probably more than 30 years ago. The reason I chose UTS is because it was closely aligned with industry and I needed that flexibility. So what about students who have experienced long term disadvantage? We know that there are students out there, I've met a lot of our input students who have caring responsibilities, especially right now, if you've been supervising homeschool, for example, for your siblings, while your parents are essential workers, then for students who have experienced long term disadvantage, then there's also the InpUTS scheme. When should you just Google UTS and InpUTS, and you can apply and you can get up to 10 extra bonus points to add to your ATAR to combine to create your selection rank. So check out the InpUTS scheme. And quite often, you'll need some additional evidence from your school and other places but it's really great to apply down this pathway and those students also get additional support here at UTS, when they come into campus, so they have a network and a buddy system as well, to help themselves feel supported. Now we had a question about pathways. And there's lots of different pathways into UTS. When I look at my current cohort, I teach a third year subject that has about 250 students in it. We have some of them that came in through the ATAR from Year 12. But there are students who came through UTS College, which is a private college owned by UTS. If you do one of their diplomas, and you achieve the minimum marks, you'll be able to go straight into second year at UTS. We also have lots of people with TAFE diplomas. And so the question here was someone studied at a college and they've done a subject as well as a diploma program. And they've been doing a diploma in Marketing and Communications. But whether that would be an option to consider whether that specific diploma would allow you to get into UTS? That's a really great question. And for that one, I would actually recommend contacting UTS directly. So you go to business@uts.edu.au; sending them an email with details of the program of the diploma that you've done, because we do accept TAFE diplomas. We also accept diplomas from other educational institutions as ways or pathways into UTS. And typically that's, you know, you've done your HSC and you might go off and do a diploma. But if you've done one through your HSC, contact the business@uts email address business@uts.edu.au. And they'll be able to help you figure that out. All right, so what are our different course options, we have a Bachelor of Business, which is the one that Jasmine's studying with her Creative Intelligence and Innovation. And so this is a broad based business degree where you study all of the major disciplines. And then you get to choose a specialization or a major in one of those. And then eight other subjects, which you can do in a combination of a second major, sub-majors, sub-majors and electives, or electives. So there's the most flexibility here in the Bachelor of Business, if you know you want to go into business, but you're unsure of exactly what type of business you're interested in. For those people who might have very specific vision already for their careers, the Bachelor of Management is aimed at students who definitely want careers in experience industries. So when I say experience industries, that's things like Events, Sport Management, Creative Enterprises. So there's some very specific information for the Bachelor of Management and check out the other Bachelor of Management sessions today, to find out more about what's in their specific programs. They do a core, which is different from the Bachelor of Business core, it's all about experience innovations, and being digitally creative. They have a major, and then again, they have another eight subjects for a major, two sub-majors, sub-major and electives or elective combination. So again, there are lots of flexibility for students who know that they want to go in wander into one of these experience type of industries after graduation. Now, I loved High School economics and the Bachelor of Economics is a relatively new degree. It's, it's only a few years old, but really, really popular for those who love economics and think I'd love to go into economics, either in a public service role with the RBA, with a government agency, or into the private sector. We have Bachelor of Economics graduates working in economics departments at banks, and major financial institutions. So you get a broad understanding of business. But with that focus on economics. That focus on economics plays out in terms of 11 core subjects in economics. So then they have some economics electives, and business electives, as well as the options of a second major. So if you're heavily into economics, this one is definitely for you. And it's relatively new, but really, really popular and does a lot of the things that you might do in a Bachelor of Business in Economics, but even more specialization. Now, for those people who are really keen on being Accountants hello to those people, that was me, when I was coming into Year 12. We also have the Bachelor of Accounting program, and this is a scholarship program. So there's no ATAR entry into this one. But these are people who know they want to build an accounting career in business, they want to be a Chief Financial Officer, or a financial controller as their career goal. It has nine core subjects, you must do the accounting major. And then you have options around majors, other majors and sub-majors. Plus, you do six months of professional internships. Now with the Bachelor of Accounting as well, they study and work pretty much all year round, they don't get a summer break, because they're usually doing other subjects. They cram essentially a four year degree into a three year period. And there's only 35 students in this. Now, if you're still keen on studying Accounting, but you don't make it into the Bachelor of Accounting, we have lots and lots of students who do the Accounting major within the Bachelor of Business as well. Now then we have combined degrees, there's a huge range of combined degrees, you can check them all out on the UTS website. But Jasmine, you're doing the BCII combined degree. What exactly is this Creative Intelligence and Innovation thing? What does that actually mean in terms of studying that as a separate degree? Jasmine - UTS Business School Student 14:26 That's definitely a mouthful of words. And it can be a little bit confusing, but essentially, Creative Intelligence and Innovation really teaches entrepreneurship and innovation kind of in a degree, which sounds like a really weird thing. But to give you an example, a lot of the work we do is based on client briefs. So a company will come to UTS; to the BCII, which is what we nicknamed Creative Intelligence and Innovation. They'll come to the BCII faculty and they'll pitch them a brief and I'll ask the students to solve whatever business problem they're having. And we will pitch it back to them as part of our assignments. It's very hands on and it's all about thinking about new ways of doing things, and coming up with innovations and starting up new businesses, which is a lot of what we learn. Dr Amanda White 15:11 And the BCII also is multi, it's transdisciplinary. So the students can't do Creative Intelligence and Innovation on their own as a degree, they have to study it with something else. So in Jasmine's cohort, there'll be students from communications, nursing, science, IT, engineering, business, design and architecture. And so you get this really rich transdisciplinary approach to study. So we have lots and lots of combined degrees. And a lot of students also start in a combined degree and then realize after you're like, oh, maybe I don't like my combined degree. And you can also transfer into the single part of one of your degrees as well if you decide that a combined degree is not for you. So there's lots of different permutations and combinations when it comes to combine degrees, depending on what the combination is. Most common is the three plus two combined degree programs. There are a few four year combined degree programs in some of the four year combined degree programs, instead of getting two majors in business, you might only get one so that you're not at university forever. So what about internships? Internships are a really important way to get practical experience in your program. So that when you go to find a graduate job, you can say, hey, I've actually had some experience in this particular industry. And it helps you understand whether this is the right job for you. And so a lot of students will do an internship and go, Oh, I thought I'd really like x; it's not what I thought it would be, I need to shift my career focus. So internships help you get work ready, increase your employability, and at UTS, you can actually do internships in most of our programs as an elective subject. So you find an internship, you go to your internship, and there's a subject around it. But students often do internships also in the summer break. So those would be separate but UTS has virtual internship fairs, and lots of ways in which you can get an internship to add that experience component. So that's a thing a lot of graduate students say; oh, gosh, okay, I'm looking for a job, they say we want some with someone with experience, an internship is a great way to get some of that experience. And you can do that across all of your business programs. So what about international opportunities? Right now, we can't go anywhere, because we're all locked down. But for students starting now, who maybe are thinking of a couple of years in advance, a lot of students will use four electives in their subjects, or in their programs to spend a year, a semester sorry, overseas or doing an exchange program with an international opportunity. There are short term international opportunities as well, with things like BUiLD, which is usually short six week activities. And for students who really want to immerse themselves in another culture International Studies combined degrees means you spend a whole year overseas. Now there's also some scholarships available for academic excellence. There's a $30,000 scholarship for the top ATAR student in our programs, the Bachelor of Accounting has its own special scholarships, and there are equity scholarships as well. So for students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, definitely check out the Scholarships page. In some years, we've had some scholarships go unawarded because nobody applied. So have a look through the scholarships and see what might be available to you. Now Jas, what would be your top tip for students who are trying to figure out where am I going to study? And what top tip would you have for them for studying with us at UTS? Jasmine - UTS Business School Student 18:48 Um, that's a tough question. But I think the advice that I would give is something that my mum told me when I was choosing, and it was ""follow your heart, but take your head with you"". So when you're choosing your degree, think about what you're going to enjoy, what you're good at and what you think you might like to do. I know it's really hard. When you're like in Year 12, especially in times like these where everything's so uncertain, it's really hard to know what you want to do. And by all means, you don't have to know by now I completely did not know when I was in year 12. But when you're making your decision, just think about what's something that you would enjoy if you had to start a degree tomorrow. And what's something you think you're good at? And if that; whatever it is, maybe it's business at UTS, wherever it is. My top tip is definitely just when you're making your decision, follow your heart but take your head with you. Dr Amanda White 19:40 Hmm, that's a great tip. I really love that saying there. And I know students will often feel a lot of parental pressure to go into a particular degree. Remember, this is you're setting you up for your career. So this is not what you're interested in. You know, think about that really carefully, but it's also never too late to change. I've had students change degrees after a couple of years and switch into something else they really love Now for more information, obviously, you can download our undergraduate business guide, I will get Erica to put that link in the chat. While I quickly answer one last question that has come up what happens if you don't want to get if you don't get the ATAR, but you still want to go into business. Um back on the earlier pathways access; things like UTS College are a great way to study at a UTS affiliated institution, complete the 18 month diploma there, and you'll be able to come straight into the Bachelor of Business. Another really popular option is to do a Diploma or an Advanced Diploma at TAFE. in accounting, for example, and then those students will come in with mostly credits for their first year. And then they'll be able to come into second year of the Bachelor of Business. So there's lots of different pathways. Another one is also you might consider studying at another institution. So we have lots of students that might study at Western Sydney, Charles Sturt, University of New England, and then after one year, and you know, they've worked really hard, got really great scores there. They apply through UAC, to come into UTS, and they'll come in in their second year of the program. I want to thank everybody for today. We hope you have a really great day trying to find out more you can stay connected with us on Instagram, Facebook, and contact us directly by phone or via email if you have any questions. So thank you very much everybody for coming. And for those people who are on Instagram and want to find out more about Accounting, I've put my Instagram details down there as well (@amandalovestoaudit). I talk a lot about what we're doing here at UTS and tips for students on my Instagram. So we look forward hopefully to welcoming you to UTS really soon. Dr Amanda White Good evening, everyone. And thank you for joining us for today's webinar where we're going to be speaking about Year 10 Subject Selection in preparation for the HSC. So, welcome to all of those students, year 10 students who are here, any parents or carers, anyone who provides career advice; we're really glad to have you along today. My name is Dr. Amanda White, I'm going to be one of your hosts and presenters for this evening. We're going to try and demystify some of the acronyms that you might have heard when it comes to making subject selections, and applying for university. We're going to talk, we have Wendy coming along from UAC to talk about HSC subjects selection, we're going to talk about your options of studying business and everything that we offer at our undergraduate level at UTS. We're going to hear from James who is going to be one of our students and he's going to tell us about his experiences, and then open Q and A. So first up, let's decrypt some of the language that comes with understanding and going for the HSC. The first one is ATAR - the Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank, you'll hear lots of Year 12 students, as they finished talking about their ATAR it is some number between zero and 99.95 that indicates your rank compared to all other students in your age group. Now added on so you've got your ATAR, which is prepared, the selection rank is your ATAR plus any adjustment points. So adjustment points, or adjustment factors used to be called bonus points or bonus schemes, but they're extra points you can get by studying certain subjects and getting high scores in those particular subjects. Your ATAR plus your adjustment points is your selection rank. And that's the number that we use when we're looking at supply and demand for university places. So UTS will consider your application based on your selection rank, which is your ATAR plus those adjustment factors. There's also a number of different admission schemes. So as well as just applying based on your selection rank, we have schemes for students that come from a wide range of backgrounds. So if you've had hardship, or other factors, or circumstances affecting your study, we also have different schemes for entry, including those for students who might be on refugee visas at the time. And the last one we're going to talk about is majors, that's often a thing students ask. What can I major in? Majoring is a specialisation at university and when you come to university, you pick a degree we'll talk about all the different options, and you'll have a specialisation. So if you're thinking about studying business, business is called a lot of different things at a lot of different universities. We have been a business school ever since our inception, but you might also hear the word commerce faculties, Sydney University, has a business school. So business commerce, it's exactly the same thing. So what are your options at UTS, we have a number of different degrees, the largest one is the Bachelor of Business, we take in probably about 2000 students in that program every single year, which is a broad business degree that allows you to prepare for a majority of careers in business. Within Management, we have the Bachelor of Management; the Bachelor of Management for a couple of different specialisations: Digital Creative Enterprises, which is around experiences, and digital experiences; Events, which is around Event Management from small events right up to large events like the Olympics, and then the Bachelor of Management with a Sports Business specialisation. So if you're interested in combining a love of sport, and a love of business, perhaps wanting to manage a sports team, or get involved into that financial side as a sports agent, lots of opportunities in the Bachelor of Management. We also have a Bachelor of Economics, there's been a massive increase in demand for skills in economics over the last five to 10 years. So we've seen a great growth in the Bachelor of Economics so that's people who know that they definitely want a career in economics. And then finally, we have our Bachelor of Accounting, which is our accounting program. So we're going to hand over to Wendy and she's going to tell us all about the intricacies of the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC). Wendy Fisher - UAC So today we'll talk about UAC and subject selections for all Year 10 students you're about to pick make a very important decision about choosing the courses that you're going to study over the next two years to complete your first qualification, which is your HSC. So firstly, I just want to tell you what you UAC is, it stands for Universities Admissions Centre and we process applications to 28 different universities and institutions within NSW and the ACT. We also look after three access schemes, which you'll learn more about when you're in year 11 and year 12. Importantly, though, we calculate the ATAR for all New South Wales students. Okay, so, um, so let's learn a bit about the ATAR. Okay, so as you're about to head towards completing your first qualification, it's good to know the difference between your HSC and the ATAR. They're both measures of achievement. But at the end of year 12, they'll be reporting to you two different things. Your HSC is going to tell you how you performed in all your different HSC causes against NESA standards. And your ATAR is just going to report to your position and it's going to tell you where you're positioned in your cohort. So just keep that in mind they're different measures of achievement, but they're reporting to you in two different ways. So when we're talking to students about this, we get you to imagine the HSC is a race. So if the HSC was a race, your HSC results would represent your finishing time in the race and your ATAR would represent your finishing place. So if you want to train for a race, you'd work really hard every day to get that best time. So that's the only thing you can control; your time, you can't control where you're going to place. So it's a bit like that by the HSC except training is working on your assessments, doing well in your exams, improving results in all your different subjects, because that's the only thing you can control. And that's going to allow you to get your best ATAR. So just remember, you can control your own performance, don't worry about the ATAR;, you are preparing yourself with the work you do over the next two years to take on that next level of tertiary study because it's at a higher level. So that's what you're preparing for. Okay, so for the HSC NESA requires you to do 12 units in Year 11. That's the requirement to get your first qualification; the HSC. But you can drop down to 10 units when you're in Year 12. If you're going to do that speak to your school for advice. But for an ATAR, we need 10 units of board develop courses, we always use two units of English followed by eight units of Category A courses and we'll need four subjects as well. So what is the ATAR? It stands for Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank. And that's what it is, it's a rank. It's not a mark or a score. It's telling you where you're positioned in your cohort. And it's the number between zero and 99.95 and the sole purpose of the ATAR is so universities can rank and select students for their courses, in particular, their competitive courses. Now in saying that there's many universities that will look at your ATAR, and they may require some other criteria, personal statement, motivation portfolio. And also, many universities offer early entry schemes where they'll have access to your year 11 results. So work hard in Year 11 and there may be something else that you'll need to provide. And that's what they might base their offers on. Okay, so for the ATAR calculation, I said before, we need 10 units of courses, we always take your best two units of English first, and then we'll take eight units from your remaining units. So if you've only got 10 units, we're going to use all 10 units, but say you've got an extension maths course and you have 11 units. If that one unit was one of your best, we would use that. And then we take one unit from one of your other courses. We always maximize your ATAR for you. Okay, so scaling. Everyone worries about scaling, but you shouldn't worry about scaling. We only scale because there's so many different combinations of HSC courses completed by Year 12 students. And if everyone did the same HSC course, we wouldn't need to scale because we could compare your results in all those same courses and rank you from highest to lowest. But you don't do the same courses. I think last year, there was more than 25,000 combinations. So in order for us to compare everyone properly and fairly, we create this level playing field. And that's all scaling does. And the reason we have this and it's so important for Year 10 students; is because we don't want any student to be advantaged or disadvantaged by their subject choice; because you should be all taking courses that you enjoy, have a natural aptitude ability in, and importantly, which is going to set you up for the university studies ahead. Okay, so just a quick scaling truth. Please don't choose courses because you think you're going to have a scaling advantage or disadvantage. It doesn't work like that. When you hear about courses that have a high scaled mean or low scaled mean it just means that it's reporting on the strength of the competition within a course. So of course, it has a high scaled mean, lots of academic students are getting high results in that and the low scaled mean, it's just a variety of academic abilities of students doing that course. It doesn't matter the course. To get an above-average ATAR you need to be getting above-average marks in all your courses. So course is irrelevant you just need to be doing well. Remember, you're preparing yourself for university studies. I'll quickly go over this, but you're going to hear about Fred and Laura's story over the next few years, your careers advisors will probably talk about it. But we have two students just so you can see the relationship between performance denature see results, and ATAR being position. And if you have a look, here you can see Fred and Laura, they do the same HSC courses. Fred gets marks of 70 for everything, Laura works a bit harder gets marks of 80. But their ATAR or position is dramatically different. It's like a 20 point difference. So I'll just go through one, if you have a look at Fred's mark of Biology, he's performance of 70. ATAR is about position. That performance placed in him in the 37th percentile of students. So it's telling us that 63% of students got a higher mark than Fred in Biology last year. Now Laura; 10 extra little marks, that performance really bolstered her position; ATAR all about position, she's in the 72nd percentile, so only 28% of students got a higher mark. Now, the median mark for that course last year was 74. Fred and Laura; they're positioned either side of that. Now if you're looking at those median marks and thinking why they're high, that's because the majority of HSC students get marks for all their courses between 50 and 100, HSC marks that is. So a median mark always hovers around 75, sometimes in the low 80s. And you can see that with English Advanced. So to get a high ATAR, you need to be getting above-average HSC marks, above-average, those median marks. Now, overall, Fred's percentiles, all of those positions based on that performance of 70 pushed him in the bottom 50% of students. And for Laura, her performance of 80 placed her mostly in the top 50 percent. This is reflected in their ATAR, the median ATAR was 70.4. Fred falling in the bottom 50%. He's on the lower side of that median, and Laura mostly performing in the top, she's on the higher side of that median. Remember, ATAR comprises a 50% assessment, 50% HSC exams average sent to UAC, that's what we put through our academic model. So work hard on your assessments, and it's never too late, you can work hard before your HSC as well. Okay, subject selection. So these important decisions you have to make, these are our top tips. So you really need to be thinking about your goals, what future career you'd like to have. You're doing that now you're doing some research by listening to this fantastic webinar with UTS. So think about you know what degree you might need to do to achieve your goals. And if you don't have any idea, because you're only in Year 10, um think about; what are the different degrees on offer and think about what might interest you. For subject selection, it's important to consider your abilities and interests. So what are we good at? What are you enjoying already, and ask for feedback from your teachers? What courses or subjects are you getting your best results in? Because you know, you're going to succeed if you're doing something over the next few years that you enjoy. Okay, importantly, see if the course has any prerequisites. Not many courses have prerequisites, which is a must-have course that you must have studied in year 11 and year 12 to be considered. Ah usually if a university does have a prerequisite for a degree, it's an academically challenging course. But importantly, check on the university websites, you'll get a Year 10 Guide from us, check to see what the universities suggest you study in year 11 and 12. So they call it assumed knowledge, which is something that the universities are going to assume you've done in year 11 and 12, and start teaching from that level. So an example would be engineering, the university will assume you've done maths advanced because they're gonna start teaching you from that level and above at first year of university. And recommended is something very relevant so take those, you know, advice into consideration when you're thinking about your subject choices. And lastly, be prepared to study hard and be happy with your choices. Enjoy the next two years, know that you're building up that academic muscle to take on that next level at university. And also, you know, remember your ATAR will not define your future success at university or your career. It's a starting point and really do your research about the different courses. Dr Amanda White Fantastic! To reiterate what what Wendy has mentioned, it's a rank and not a mark and choose courses that you're good at. Explore all your options. This is what the next couple of years of Open Days and talking with careers counsellors and going to different events is all about. And you know, the ATAR isn't like a gift card where you have to spend it all. That's the other thing that I would add onto there. All right, you can make sure that you stay connected with the UAC, through their website, on Facebook, their Instagram and their YouTube channel as well. So I'm going to talk about our options at business schools. And there's a great question here, it says, Do we need any units of science if we need to do a business course at UTS? Absolutely not. So if you're interested in doing business, you don't need to worry about doing science to come into any of our business courses. Another thing that's a big myth is that, you know, I teach accounting is accounting, a lot of maths? Mathematics is not a prerequisite for any of our courses in business at UTS. Some courses that are, are more math-heavy, like finance, and like economics, it is advised that you do some maths in the HSC. But it's not a prerequisite in any way, shape, or form. And lots of students who don't have that prerequisite knowledge will go on to do free courses through our Maths and Science Study Centre in algebra, and introduction to calculus to allow them to really get the hang of those fundamentals that they might need for advanced finance, and advanced economics. It's actually quite a big myth that accounting also uses a lot of mathematics, I just use my phone as the calculator for most of our accounting problems. So you don't need to worry about a maths prerequisite, you don't need to worry about a science prerequisite either. Now, of course, if you are thinking about a double degree, especially in engineering, or it, then maths or science might be appropriate. There's a great question here about bridging courses, you can take your bridging course before University starts, or you can do it simultaneously, as well. So there's a couple of different ways to manage the bridging courses at UTS. And in early days, when you get to your first subjects that are really heavy and a bit heavier in mathematics, what will happen is that there will be a diagnostic test that you'll be able to take, it doesn't affect whether you can still enrol in the subject or not, it's for your own information. And if it perhaps you're a little bit low in some of those areas, they will recommend that you go for one of our free courses. Now we have so many different programs available at UTS so just because you might have this idea that I'm interested in business or economics, maths, marketing, English, legal studies, sport, then a business degree is a really great option. Because there are so many different career pathways. A Bachelor of Business is our taster program where if you know you want a business career, but you're not sure which specific business career you're interested in, then the Bachelor of Business is the best place to be in your first year, you get to try a little bit of everything before choosing a major or a specialization later. And there's all sorts of different career pathways. Now, if you already have some information about where you want to go, then on our next slide hopefully is the Bachelor of Management, oh Bachelor of Economics sorry. If you know that you're definitely keen to become an economist or economics is where you want to be for your career and that could be an economist with somewhere like the Reserve Bank; one of my former students, Rachel is an economist at Deloitte Access Economics. so if you have that interest highly in economics, you want to get into that field then the Bachelor of Economics is where you want to be. Its 11 core subjects specializing in economics, then you get choice of other economic subjects, as well as perhaps branching out into some other areas with some electives. So if you're keen on economics, then a Bachelor of Economics. If you're interested in events, design, marketing, sports, then the Bachelor of Management is where we need to go. Because there's all sorts of different options in the Bachelor of Management around events around digital creative enterprises, and digital marketing, and also around sport management and sport business. There's a range of different pathways there. So if you're unsure about something general Bachelor of Business. If you're absolutely certain you want to be an accountant then if you're interested in business studies, mathematics, then the accounting pathway is through our scholarship program, which is the Bachelor of Accounting. The Bachelor of Accounting if you just search Bachelor of Accounting UTS is a almost $60,000 a year scholarship program that runs for three years that is about developing Australia's next big chief financial officers and accountants. So if you're keen to go into that particular area, then the Bachelor of Accounting. There's a great question there about do we offer actuarial studies we don't actually offer Actuarial Studies at UTS unfortunately, you need to consider another university to go down the actuarial studies path. And for those interested in banking, there was a question about maths extension and banking. If you start with your two-unit maths, that is a good place to start extension is better if you're interested in going into finance, because the mathematics in finance can get a little bit complicated. I'm not really great at mathematics, even though I'm an accountant. And an extension can be really helpful in those finance subjects. Now, you might think, Oh, I'm interested in business, but I also really like science, or I'm interested in doing law, or I maybe want to be a doctor. So maybe I want to branch out and do medical science as well, you can combine our Bachelor of Business with a whole range of other areas. And you can see that list there, the Bachelor of Management does combined with some areas, and the Bachelor of Economics as well. But the greatest number of combinations come from the Bachelor of Business. I just want to draw your attention quickly on that previous slide, to the Creative Intelligence and Innovation, double degree option, you might not have heard of a Creative Intelligence and Innovation program, it's a degree specifically focused on advanced problem solving and innovation. So Creative Intelligence, is really about using data to solve really tricky problems. So if you're interested in really great problem solving, and teamwork, and working in a transdisciplinary way, using lots, meeting lots of different people from different faculties, then that's a great major to think about. Alright, okay. Now, if you're interested in languages, and you might think about, oh, maybe I might want to study overseas for a year, then an international studies, a combined degree can be a really great option, you'll get to learn a language and then spend a year studying that language in that language overseas. You can also do shorter programs with six-monthly global exchanges, or even six-week programs, through our different international opportunities. But there are a whole range of different languages that you can learn. And if you're not interested in learning a language, but you still want to spend some time overseas, then we can do that through our exchange program. Because there are a number of different universities in Europe, in South America, and in Asia, where they actually teach classes in English. So you don't actually need to know another language to be able to attend school there. So international languages are always an option. So in terms of selection resources, UAC has a great subject compass, you can make your choices about careers, and it will tell you where ah what careers to go, what subjects might be useful. There's the ‘study, work grow’ website, we're not affiliated with them in any way. But they do have a great calculator to help you with subjects selection. And then UAC has some great subject selection worksheets. Now, there was a question in the chat also Patricia's typing there, but is it common for students to do more than one degree? It's, we have quite a lot of double degree students, but we also have lots of single degree students as well. It just depends on what you're interested in doing with your university career, and how quickly you want to get out into the workforce as well. Now, obviously, I'm going to tell you UTS is great, because I've worked here, I was an undergraduate student here, before you were all born, probably at the same time, maybe your parents were born. So I did my degree at UTS in the 90s. I chose a business degree because I wanted a well-rounded degree, I wanted industry experience. And then I went, I was working in a big four accounting firm. And then I came back to become an academic. But now I want to introduce James and James is one of our students. And he's one of our SPROUTS. So we have students who do lots of work talking to other people about their experiences at UTS. So James, how you doing today? James - UTS Business School Hi Amanda, I'm really excited to be here. Dr Amanda White Excellent. Excellent. So tell us a bit about what you're studying at UTS. James - UTS Business School So at the moment, I'm in my third year of studying a Bachelor of Business, which is the most popular degree at UTS for business, as Amanda's mentioned. So I'm currently completing a major in marketing and I'm doing a sub-major in finance as well as management. Dr Amanda White So a maths question there, now that you're doing the finance major, how much maths did you do in high school? James - UTS Business School So I did a standard level of mathematics. I chose to do standard mathematics. And I found the transition to university mathematics, not too hard. Obviously, there's going to be at times you're going to need to refresh and kind of look back at what you've done. But at UTS what's been great about the mathematics is that they teach you so if you're not sure of something, they go through a deep dive of each subject, I guess. Dr Amanda White Perfect. And when you were in year 10, and you were trying to think about what subjects How did you pick which subjects for your HSC. James - UTS Business School So what I chose to do was I selected subjects that I was passionate about subjects that I had a genuine interest in. I was lucky or not lucky, but I didn't have a parent telling me you need to read this, or you need to read that. I am someone that's always had a wide range of interests in different areas. So it was great that the HSC was able to accommodate that for me. Additionally, I was privileged at my, at my high school that I was offered a large pool of subjects to select from. So therefore, I was able to decide and select subjects that echoed my interests, essentially. Dr Amanda White Fantatsic. And who did you talk to you? Did you talk to like, what did you chat with your parents or teachers in trying to make those choices? James - UTS Business School Yeah, so I was fortunate to have a plethora of resources. So I had conversations with my career's counsellor, who provided a lot of information about subjects that may lead to different degrees or subjects that kind of have a good fit. There was also information nights at my school. So if, if I can reminisce for a moment, remembering at the end of year 10, walking into a large hall full of teachers trying to, you know, inform everyone about their subjects. And I remember feeling quite confronted about it, which can be a daunting experience, especially if you're in year 10. But that was very helpful, because your teachers are your best people to talk to. What I'm going to kind of re-emphasize tonight is that, you know, pick their brains, ask them questions. They're the they're the experts in their field. So they are definitely a resource that you can lean on for sure. Dr Amanda White Fantastic. Did you come to any open days? Or check out other unis while you were trying to make the your choices? James - UTS Business School Yeah, um, so I was actually started very early, I actually went to Open Days at UTS since I was, or since year nine, essentially, Dr Amanda White I probably talked to you at one of those at some point James - UTS Business School You definitely have. So after university, I plan to go into the marketing field. I'll explain a little bit later about what I've been doing recently, in terms of internships, and opportunities, but I want to go into the marketing field, potentially product marketing or digital marketing space. And I also enjoy the idea of being a management consultant as well. Dr Amanda White Did you know you wanted to do marketing when you came to uni straightaway? James - UTS Business School So yeah, that was; I've always had a passion for marketing, essentially, from a young age. When I was in Year 10 actually, I was a bit of an entrepreneur. I still am a photographer. So I used my passion; I developed a passion for marketing, since Year 10. And then, the opportunity to explore that further University was something that was attractive to me. And yeah, I've still got that burning passion for it. Dr Amanda White That's awesome. Thanks, James, for sharing some of your experiences. I teach 1,600 first-year students, and we've just had them write reflections about where they want their career to go. And it's actually really common as well, for probably about a third of our students come into their business degree, unsure of where they want to go. And so they're just trying everything so that they can find that one thing that clicks. So fantastic. Thanks very much, James. James - UTS Business School No worries. We're gonna go to the next slide, please. Dr Amanda White There's one other slide. Yes. Awesome. James - UTS Business School So the first thing what I wanted to mention was consider your options. So the subjects you study for your HSC should be relevant to your interests, and should respond to any prerequisites or, assumed knowledge that is required. So as Amanda has already mentioned, there are no prerequisites for UTS degrees. So what I want to really emphasize is that there are lots of resources out there. You know, you can speak to your business teacher, you can speak to your English teacher, they can give you advice on different pathways. I know when I went to school, the library was the goldmine of information about universities, so there'll be lots of pamphlets there as well. So that is definitely something to look out for. The second point is that to study what you love. So choose subjects that you actually care about, and that you're good at. And this will likely increase your chances of success and potentially bump up your ATAR. So if you, if you do subjects that you're going to enjoy, it's going to make your last two years a lot more enjoyable. I feel like in my times that adversity, if I hadn't quite received the mark that I wanted to, because I was doing subjects that I enjoyed, I was able to keep going and keep pushing up. And then the third thing that I wanted to mention was to think ahead. So 50% of jobs in 2030 don't exist yet. And a great you need degree will definitely prepare you for the opportunities. So it's it's a very exciting time to be in Year 10. You have things like the metaverse being developed right now, a lot of technology being created, and there's definitely a lot of opportunity going into the future. Back to you Amanda. Dr Amanda White Common tips for doing well in year 11. Patricia's answering that one. And there's a question about early offers based on your 12 results or your 11 results. We don't have any information yet about our early offer program. But that will be coming out in the next I'm not sure when it's going to be coming out. But what I would suggest is make sure that you follow UTS on social media because when the UTS, especially the UTS Business School, when the UTS Business School has that information, we will be sharing it on our socials. So you can hopefully catch that information there. All right so; the other thing to think about is Open Day, which is coming up on the 27th of August, where you can come and check out the campus (hopefully) I hope that open day will be live, so you can come and visit us; find out and talk to academics as well as students from a whole range of different areas across the university, check out our double degree programs as well as our single degree programs as well. So of course, now we have time for q&a. So if you have any questions, now's the time to add them into the q&a. While we're waiting for any questions to come through, I might also talk to you a little bit about our business programs at UTS. So UTS has always been highly regarded as an industry committed University and more than 20 years ago, many more than 20 years ago when I chose UTS in the 90s. That was because it was a well-connected, industry-focused university. And that continues to this day. I teach first-year accounting. Most of my tutors come from industry. They are accountants, and they're working in accounting in real life every day. And they have a passion also for supporting students and education. So there is definitely a real great industry connection with UTS. Q - Is their work placements for the events course, I'll answer that one live. So in your Bachelor of Management program, as well as in your Bachelor of Business, and a Bachelor of Economics, there are opportunities to take or go on internships for credit as part of your subject. When it comes to those internships, students are given support to find their own internship. You don't have to do one but of course, having an internship is a great way to test out your potential future career get you some experience. And a lot of students who do internships then go on to work maybe part-time at that company while they're completing their degree. So there are quite a lot of internships. Q - Are there holiday programs to attend or any work experience opportunities in regards to holiday programs in accounting, finance, marketing, a lot of our business disciplines, they will take a summer interns, so that will be a summer work experience program. And we say to students, you study in the autumn session and the spring session, and the summer session is for you to go out and get that experience. We have careers fairs and a number of different careers activities to advertise or different firms that are offering work experience or internship opportunities. Sometimes they're called vacation jobs. And lots of our students go on those and apply through the different avenues available at UTS. Q - For those who want to study accounting is a great question. We want to study accounting, do we need to study mathematics advanced? I would say no. So in accounting, it's really about problem-solving. It's about connecting with people. It's about communication. And the most advanced accounting and mathematics we might do is maybe a little bit of algebra, and maybe some regression analysis which you'll learn in your first year Business Statistics program, but just standard mathematics is fine. As I mentioned, I use my phone 99% of the time as a calculator. And then sometimes we might get into Excel. So it's not necessarily that you need lots of Maths. But if you've had some Excel experience that will come in very handy when it comes to university. Q - Okay, there was a question about advanced maths, I would recommend doing advanced maths if you love maths, if maths is something you really enjoy doing. And my husband and my son ah, just love, love, love mathematics. They love logic, they love mathematical problem-solving. And so for them advanced maths, you know, is a no brainer, but it's just up to you and what you're passionate about. Because remember, you have to study these subjects, you have to work hard at it. So if you enjoy advanced maths, then definitely go for it. Q - All right, another good one. How transferable are the skills of business bachelors to another course science. And this is where it becomes really interesting. Because if you think oh, my business, I might do science, you become really passionate about science and you want to go into, you know, a research program or you want to manage a lab, or you want to lead a scientific team, then you're going to need to have business skills, no matter which other degree engineering it journalism, movie production, animation, you're going to need to know about business, because your role will involve interacting, or managing money or creating budgets in some way, shape, or form. So they're really quite complementary skills, in terms of the things that you learn in business about managing business, reading, financial information, understanding marketing, for example, that can be really important if you're trying to fund a scientific study, prepare that budget, pitch for an engineering job. So they can all be quite important. Q - What if what if you have a bad careers advisor, or you don't even have one? Well, I certainly recommend coming along to any of the university open days that we have, because we can provide you with lots of career advice as well. The other option is to talk to a teacher that you might know. But you UAC has lots of resources. And so do a lot of career advice websites that are out there; that your school might have access to; definitely check out those. Q - And very last question for tonight. What's the difference between studying accounting in a Bachelor of Business or studying the Bachelor of Accounting, it is exactly the same degree. But the Bachelor of Accounting students get their $60,000 scholarship. Plus they get a built-in internship experience with the program sponsors. The sponsors are the ones whose front up the $60,000 as well for their scholarship over the three years. That's the only difference they study exactly the same subjects, you can still get internship experience in the Bachelor of Business majoring in Accounting, through going on summer internships as well. Q - Oh, one last one. This is my very last question. Does your ATAR matter after certain amount of years, once you've been away from high school for a couple of years, you'll take a mature age entry through UAC. And that will involve partly providing those ATAR results but also providing, you know a statement about where you've been what you've been doing over that period of time, to be able to have an entrance into university. Best to contact us at business@uts.edu.au and they can provide you with some more advice. A lot of students sometimes will go to TAFE, and maybe do a TAFE qualification before transferring and applying to UTS through UAC. Thank you everyone for taking that time out to connect with us and find out more for those people who want to also connect with us on social media you can find us on Facebook, and on Instagram, @UTS_Business, there is our email address. If anybody ever needs to get in touch with me, you can do that on Instagram as well. I've put my instagram handle down there (@amandalovestoaudit). I talk a lot about accounting, business news, supporting our students at UTS so if you're interested to reach out directly to an academic, you can contact business@uts.edu.au they will often funnel that to me or you can reach out to us directly. So I want to thank everybody for coming along tonight. I want to thank Wendy from UAC; I know that we had some technical problems there but you can find out lots of information about us at the UAC website. I want to thank James for sharing his experiences as well. For Patricia for actually being there also furiously typing in the chat. We hope to welcome you at Open Day (I should be at Open Day this year so if you come along, come and say hi and hey look Amanda I saw you at Year 10 selection information evening, come up and say hi and we can chat more about your options in Business at UTS. We hope you have a great evening and we'll chat to you all soon. Dr Amanda White Good evening, and good afternoon, everybody. My name is Dr. Amanda White, and I'm going to be your emcee for our Parents and Carers Information Session. I am a Senior Lecturer in the Accounting Discipline at UTS. I'm also the Deputy Head Education in Accounting, and I've been an academic and also an alumni of UTS, as well as having some practical accounting experience from the public accounting big 4 industry. So today we'll be talking about some key things you can think about in terms of supporting your young person when it comes to coming to UTS. And we're really excited to have everybody here today. So first off, we always start with our Acknowledgement of Country, the UTS Business School respectfully acknowledges that we're on the land of the Gadigal people of the Eora nation. The Gadigal people have cared for their community land and waters for 1000's of generations based on their deep knowledge of their country. We pay our respects to their ancestors, their elders, and acknowledge their ongoing status as the first peoples of this land. And I would like to acknowledge the Dharug people. I'm coming from Dharug country today here in North Western Sydney. So who are we, my name is Amanda. I am the Deputy Head Education for the Accounting Discipline Group. I've been teaching accounting here at UTS for almost two decades now. And I'm involved in a whole range of initiatives to help support people in their education. We also have Dr. James Wakefield, and Dr. Simone Faulkner. They are both very experienced first year subject coordinators, and also our First and Further Year Experience Coordinators in the Business School. UTS prides itself on our ability to help people transition from wherever they are before UTS, whether that is high school, they've had a gap year, they've been at a VET related vocational college or somewhere else. We really pride ourselves on helping people transition to UTS. And we take a whole of university approach with university-based initiatives, as well as faculty and subject specific initiatives. So James and Simone their work is integral integral to our first year programs to make sure that everybody feels welcome. And they have all the tools that they need to succeed here at UTS. So what are we going to be covering tonight, we're going to be talking about HSC support. And for those people whose young person already has an early offer for UTS, congratulations to those families and groups, but we'll be talking about how you can support them through the HSC. What we do to support students to transition to university, how our students remain safe on campus and what we do to ensure that safety, how you can support your young person at university, and then also some open Q and A. So thank you, everybody. And for some of the questions, we will have some answers typed, but for some of them, we will be answering them live. For example, one of the questions of about early entry for the Bachelor of Communication, one of our marketing and comms teams will get onto that one, or I will get onto that one, we have some of the presentations. early entry offers are already out. And we hope that everybody who applied for one has received a response. So now I'm going to pass over to James and James is going to talk about HSC support. Dr James Wakefield So after I've had a chat about HSC support, I'm going to talk about making the transition to university and give you some advice in terms of making decisions as your kids make, you know, move forward to the university experience. Okay, so I'm just going to start off with some general advice. Obviously, the HSC process is a two year process, you know, year 11 to 12. It is a lengthy process, it's a marathon. It's really the end of 13 years of study through primary to high school. And a lot of what has already been studied has prepared you know, your son, your daughter, the child you're giving care to up until this point, right. So really, this is the end of the marathon. It's about consolidation now, addressing any gaps or anything that they want to revise in more detail as they move towards the final exams. And a lot of you know the assessments they have done this year, obviously count towards their final mark anyway. Dr Amanda White So what's important here and this is advice that I give my students as well that I teach at UTS. So this year, I've been coordinating the first year accounting subject is a balance of finances. eyes are very important, okay? It is very easy to, you know, study all the time, particularly during lockdown, when you know, you've been told to stay home don't go out. And so I would encourage you not to encourage your son, your daughter, to stay at home, stick to the books, you know, 16 hours a day, as researchers, we know the value of taking a break, going out and doing something else. We come back to things with different perspectives, things that we couldn't work out before, we then can work out. So certainly sticking to the books or the computer studying the material for many, many hours a day or you know, 16 hours a day, or 10 hours or 12 hours, it's probably not the best thing at this point. As I said, it's sort of the end of the marathon anyway. So it's now time for consolidation, and making sure that balance is there, not, you know, burning out moving towards the exams. So support, encouragement is the key thing. Pressure is not right, the HSC experience, a lot of students are already very stressed about it so pressure and to get higher marks really just compounds that. You know, I'm sure your daughter or your son understand the importance of, you know, the exams and where they're moving forward. So that's not really necessary. Dr James Wakefield In terms of peer networking, I mean, this is one of the key supports in study, whether it's at high school or university, having that peer network and keeping in touch with their friends is important part of studying, understanding things, understanding things in different ways, as well as generally making sure that you're well, and that you have your support of your your friends, right. And so that's something to be encouraged. And this generation is probably one of the most connected out of any generation that came before us. You know, there's so many different ways that can connect. Social media is, you know, a driver of that to a very large extent. And that's, that's great to encourage those connections, and that networking, and keeping in touch. But of course, social media is also sort of a double edged sword. I've done research in this area, I've surveyed students that have studied my subject here at UTS, we have about 2000 students a year study that subject and we looked at how they use social media and how that was related to this. I was able to use it communicate, using it excessively, is not so good. And in fact, we found that that students on average, used it more than two hours a day, which actually surprised me, I didn't expect they would use it that much. And we basically found that once you get sort of that level, once you using multiple hours a day, it is significantly related to lower student performance, you know, so we saw that students that used it three hours a day had about a 10%, lower mark, in the final exam for the subject I teach, versus those that don't use it. So that's also compounded if the student is struggling with the content and finding it challenging; social media can provide an outlet to escape. And so you know, be mindful of that. Keep an eye on your son, your daughter, and you know, make sure they're not spending too much time on social media, because it can bring down their results. Dr Amanda White Now in saying all that an important part of this process is thinking about what they're going to do next, right, so where they're going to go, what they're going to do with their marks their ATAR mark, to enter university. And so the key thing to start with here is the ATAR they get for their HSC is what it is right. You know, there's no going back. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. And this is something that I heard back in my high school days. The most common piece or the most frequent piece of advice my career advisor gave the cohort was don't repeat, right? And most students don't repeat the HSC and it's very obvious why that's the case when you come to university because you find a lot of pathways and options that are available that you weren't aware of before. Okay. So the ATAR is what it is, move forward with it, and encourage your kids to think about you know, what do they perform well in and what did they enjoy? Okay? You know, you might have perspectives on what you think is good, or, you know, a career that has great opportunities or something you might like to do or might have liked to have done. But that's not necessarily what's best for them. You know, Simone, Amanda and I have been to many Open Days over the years, and we've spoken to many parents, many caregivers, you know, many potential students. And sometimes we have, you know, you know, potential students that are dragged into the university by their parents, we can see the look on their face, they don't want to be at this particular part of information day. And that is not the way to go. Because Simone and I, who teach first year subjects at UTS, we see the implications of what that does when when the student turns up to class. And they're disengaged, and they're not interested. You know, and this is the start of a three year program. And employers place a lot of emphasis on, you know, what students achieved throughout their program, and what they, you know, do in addition to their program more broadly, so contributing to society, being part of parts of, you know, clubs and societies etc. And so if your daughter, your son is not interested in what they're doing, it's a bad start, okay. So if they don't want to do it, or they're not interested, don't push them down that pathway, he won't do them any favors, okay? In saying that, as well, you know, don't base course, decisions on what others are doing. So you know, while someone else say, you know, a brother or a sister might have done well, or a cousin might have done well, in this particular career path, that doesn't necessarily mean again, it's for them. Dr James Wakefield Now, as I mentioned, cost flexibility is a big thing about university. Our program, our Bachelor of Business program, which is the most popular program we offer in the UTS Business School, has a lot of flexibility. So basically, we have eight core subjects, which are compulsory subjects, students complete in the first year, across accounting, management, finance, economics, marketing, and more. And then essentially, students then choose what major sub majors and electives they want to go into in their second and third year if they're doing it full time. And so that's just a simple example how selecting that one program opens up a range of possibilities, right? In saying that, if you know, someone is student enrolls in a course, and you know, it's not for them, then of course, they can transfer and their grades are taken into account in terms of what they've achieved in that course, in terms of where they're transferring to, right. So as I said, the ATAR is not the final deal in terms of what you're going to do and what degree you have to do. And what you have to finish, it is the starting point of, you know, the university study journey, basically, so, so keep that in mind. And, again, of course, it's important to work hard, but it's not, it's important to also not be so stressed and think, you know, this is the end of the world if I don't get the ATAR mark that I want because I you know, I've lost count of the number of friends and people I know that started courses, and then have gone off and done other things, you know, so, so with a music course, and ended up becoming, you know, a specialist doctor, you know, as they move through the university journey. So when it comes to transitioning to university UTS has a lot of expertise in this area. So I'm just going to talk through this now, a few slides around transition to university. Basically what transition means, is successfully transitioning to a university experience from whatever path our students come from, and then successfully moving throughout our programs and then graduating from UTS. And this is inbuilt into all the different programs that we offer. So our core subjects are our first year compulsory subjects and our Bachelor of Business program in the UTS Business School are set up so students have the opportunity to meet and network with other students doing those courses. Hopefully, they'll also run into some people they met at the UTS welcomes an orientation, which is an important part of the UTS experience. And then moving throughout their experience we have a range of aspects that assist transition. So for example, UTS Careers is engaged throughout our courses from the first semester through to the last semester. So it's not just a matter of you know, when when your daughter or your son gets the last year study and starts thinking - What should I do now? What job should I apply for? It starts from day one of the university experience right. Thinking about what they want to do, what skills they need to develop, what experience that they want to seek out during their university studies? And so this is part of successfully transitioning through the program. We have a lot of focus on making sure students are engaged so interactive classes; so where we do have face to face classes, whether they're online or on campus, they are interactive classes, they're not the traditional, you know, university, big lecture hall classes, where someone stands up the front and someone you know, everyone listens for a couple of hours. We still have, you know, content released in a one way mode, but that's more online. So when students come to campus, they're engaging, they're getting involved in different activities and they're developing their belonging, which is an important part of the university experience. So the Bachelor of Business program is the oldest running business program in Australia. So it was established in 1975 and obviously UTS is made up of a number of institutions that merged together in the late 80s. And so that has carried on that expertise has moved through time. But one of the things that we are very well known for at UTS is being professionally focused. So those job ready skills are really core to our programs and what we deliver and that's emphasized with careers engagement throughout our courses, so students have that focus, they are career ready and they can get engaged in thinking about their career options, and making the most of those opportunities as they move through their studies. So the last thing that I'm going to talk about tonight, and if you have any questions as we move through this, please ask at any time happy to address them; is how do we support transition in more detail? Well, in terms of the first couple of weeks of studies at UTS, in addition to orientation, we focus on building friendships and networking, establishing those associations, and scaffolding, you know, the learning of academic skills. So what we mean by scaffolding is building up those skills over time. So rather than just trying to cram them all in one subject, we have them dispersed throughout our program so students can learn, you know how to learn more effectively. And that's one of the aspects of university that's different from high school. At high school students often told, you know, this is what you should do, that's what you should know, you know, make sure you prepare in this way whereas university is a lot more flexible in terms of how we work with our students. We provide regular feedback in the class and online around how students are progressing, including early stage feedback. So they can, you know, revise concepts and seek extra help and assistance if they need it rather than waiting to the final exam, we want them to basically make the most of their learning experience and resources available throughout our teaching sessions. Rather than just wait to the final exam, get the result and find out they haven't done as well as they wanted to do, we basically want to guide them and help them along the way. Mentoring is a very important part of our programs, as I mentioned we have a program where more senior students run study sessions with which is called UPass with our students across a range of different subjects, including the more challenging subjects so that peer networking is certainly in-built through the program. And at university there are a range of extracurricular activities. And one of the key differences you know, with high school compared to university and high school, in many cases, you know, the high school staff will push students and say, do this, do that, you know, get involved with this. And at university, we definitely encourage students to get involved in extracurricular activities but we don't make them do extracurricular activities. So this is one of the differences with university and the importance of, you know, students choosing a program that interests them, and doing something that they're motivated to study is it's really up to them to take advantage of all these different extracurricular opportunities that we offer. Right, so peer networking programs, clubs and societies getting involved and making the most of career resources. And we also have support by our, you know, our UTS support network so, health, medical support, our library, we have an amazing library now beside our UTS tower, and there's also UTS mobile app, which to be honest with you, I don't know whats on the mobile app and maybe one of my colleagues... Dr Amanda White The app is awesome. If we didn't even advertise it, I think we got like 5000 Student downloads in the first week. Dr James Wakefield Excellent. All right. Yeah. Yeah. That's it for me. So as I said, happy to answer any questions. I'll pass on to Amanda, who's going to have a look at the next slide. Dr Amanda White Thank you, James. Safety is always a big concern. And when I was going to university more than okay, so it was almost three decades ago at UTS that was a big concern of my parents; going into the city; I lived quite a distance away from university; so they were very keen to make sure that I was safe on campus. So I think, James, on the next slide, we take students and staff safety very seriously. And one of the biggest issues has been sexual assault on campus and there's been significant government inquiries into this. And as a result of that UTS, and all institutions across Australia now require mandatory training for all students and all staff in a program called Respect, Now, Always - Consent Matters. So that is something that all students have to engage in so that we're all on a level playing field, no matter what our backgrounds, our previous experiences, and our school experiences. We take this very seriously. There's also a UTS sexual assault support hotline that is manned 24/7. Security help points on campus, they're these little things with an orange button that you can press. There's even an after-hours security escort service. So if students are driving to campus, then if you're parked a bit aways off campus, you can request a security escort. And there's also a shuttle. So we have quite a very large and spread out campus. So if students do feel a little bit uncomfortable walking those distances by themselves, there is a security shuttle as well. And we always recommend that students put our UTS Security Office number into their mobile phones, as well. And from any internal phone, you can dial SIX (6), so we take that matter of security very seriously. It also means that from a physical security standpoint, students are required to have their ID, we have COVID-19 safety protocols, and check-in at various buildings. So like many other public institutions, UTS has been open, it's been closed, had adjustments to our guidelines, and we're always following NSW Health. So we do have the possibility to be exempt from COVID-19 requirements because we are an educational institution however, we choose to follow the NSW guidelines. There are hand sanitizing stations outside of every room in a range of different places. Students forget their mask, they have one available at the security office, and we provide online and on campus options for learning. Now, right now, we don't have any mandatory vaccination requirements, besides what is available for NSW Health. So NSW Health says to be out and about in public spaces, then you have to be double vaccinated or single vaccinated with a second vaccination appointment. We do accept students onto campus with a medical exemption for being vaccinated and also because education is an essential service, if you were not vaccinated, but you have a negative COVID test, within three days of coming to campus, then you can access campus as well. But there is no mandatory requirement. So we are not forcing students back onto campus. We're letting each student and their family make the decision as what's best for them. So activities are being held on campus in socially distance manners. And we're having orientations and other activities online. With our classes we're not packing students into lecture theatres sort of shoulder to shoulder; our lectures are pre-recorded activities so that when they come onto campus, they're doing hands-on or active learning. So learning by doing, by reviewing each other's work, by having their work reviewed by the teacher, getting feedback, engaging in trial and error. So we want our campus experiences to not just be sitting there, you know, being a bucket that's being filled, it's being part of the process. Students also have access to their teachers and coordinators through online drop-in sessions. And we have our tutorials and workshops on campus. But we do have online options for those students who feel like they're not quite ready at this point to come onto campus. And I know that there can be a lot of anxiety around that, especially if you have family members who can't be vaccinated, and that's me especially, I have two young children who they're four and they're eight they can't be vaccinated right now. So we try and provide as much flexibility as possible for our students. For our offshore students who are studying from overseas there's of course, online options. And there's also lots of online study support so if you need help with academic referencing, academic writing, English, Maths, great, if you want to come onto campus, all of those services are available but we also have those services available online as well. So, now I'm going to hand to Simone and Simone's going to talk about how you can support your young person, when they start university. It's a really big, interesting time. And it's the time often for a lot of people to go out into the world and explore. So Simone, what tips do we have for parents this evening? Dr Simone Faulkner Thank you, Amanda. And yes, like, like, James, I'm another First Year Coordinator. So I've met many young people who, you know, fresh out of high school. And I know that I get a lot of emails from those young people with concerns about, you know, different family problems, as well as potentially other issues that might have arisen during the course of the semester. So I know that family life is a really critical component of university life, you can't, the two aren't mutually exclusive. So it's really important that you understand in as much detail as possible, or as much detail as your child will allow you, to the expectations that the university has of the students. I suppose a quick tip before I do begin is to inquire, inquire from your young person as to the subjects that they're enrolling in. And you might even want to look over some of the details of those subjects. And it might just be the course handbook as a starting point, you can look at the course handbook for each of the subjects that a student might take. And if they're studying the Bachelor of Business, it might be the Bachelor of Management, Bachelor of Economics, there's a core program of subjects that are there and available to you. You can have a look at the types of assessments that they're required to do, the types of learning outcomes that are required of them. And you can just start to discuss with them as to you know, what that means for their future. And also what that means in terms of their workload going forward. Because we all know that, well, maybe we don't all know but I have realized over the last few years, that students when they get into first year, are very overwhelmed with the workload. And it's four subjects that they're studying. In comparison to the six or seven, or eight subjects that they're studying at high school. However, they're jam packed in a 12 week program those four subjects. And you'll have, oftentimes, an assessment for each subject, due around about the same time and it's really hard to juggle those tasks. So if you can sit with your child, and go through those tasks, in terms of you know, when they're due or what they might involve, that might help to relieve any pressure. Other tips that I have? So James has already mentioned, you know, the idea that it's really important for students to get outside of that study space and look at more broadly about a student's interests. And so your child may have received an early offer, and that's really exciting, they may have received multiple offers. So it's about you checking in with your child as to the skills that they would like to develop themselves. So have a think we're starting to think more about the reverse process for career development. So looking at the attributes, that industry that organizations are expecting of newly graduated students, and those attributes are listed in every subject outline, those attributes as learning outcomes, and so you can sit with your child and say, well, this subject helps you to develop your collaboration skills, it helps you to develop your problem solving skills. Is that something thing that you're interested in. And it's definitely I can tell you, these are the skills that the employers want of future graduates. And if it's something that your child is curious to develop, then you know that might be the right program for them. So get them to think about what they're good at. But what they'd also like to challenge themselves to develop in the future. And I've mentioned checking in with subjects and assessments; something like a little calendar or you know, a spreadsheet up on a wall or on a computer with when key deliverables are for each of the subjects would be super useful for your child to develop whether or not they share that with you. But it will keep that time management in check. Now encourage your young child to get involved in university life. James has mentioned the multiple extracurricular activities are available to students nowadays, and it is phenomenal. When your child comes onto campus and has a look at all of the clubs and societies available to them. They might be a little dumbstruck at the beginning. Because there are a lot of options whether they are sporty or crafty, or academic doesn't matter. They might have this niche love of something like anime or what's the Quidditch Society or you know, something really niche, but there's something for everyone. Now, research has been conducted here at UTS to demonstrate that membership in a club or society is strongly related to student success. And what does student success mean? Well it means that students are more likely to stay in their courses so they're not flicking between courses and getting worried that they're in the wrong place. Students success is also academic success. So grades improve. Employability increases as well. Their self confidence and global citizenship skills are also enhanced, because they're, you know, meeting with more and more people who can foster that interest with them. So I've got a link here that you might want to read up more about that study about how membership in clubs and societies, those extracurricular activities can really benefit a student can make the experience fun, can make them feel like they belong on campus (Results from a UTS study correlating membership in clubs and societies with student success: https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/151238/2/ActivateUTS%20Report%202020.pdf) And I suppose lastly there; reassure your child that it's okay to receive help if they need it. And this is something that we really need to as first year cohort coordinators, we really need to drum in; weekly to our students, that help is you know, just one email away or it's one knock on the door away and there are multiple services. So at high school students have a lot of support, you know, whether it is something like careers counseling, or chatting with their teachers who they're much closer to then possibly University, and they have those support services at their disposal. At University there are even more services provided by the library, by our higher education, language programs. By our Institute of Interactive Media and Literacy, there's a whole lot of places to go for assistance; we have Student Services. If your student has accessibility requirements, they can sign up and receive extra support there. We have special consideration programs; so if a student is struggling with you know, some family issues at home, health problems, they can apply for special consideration. There's a lot of those University services available but there's also subject level services. So tutors are there to really help students along the way, not only in providing feedback for their assignments, but also to guide their thinking their learning and submission of assignments. So yeah, tutors, subject coordinators; we're all here to make sure those young people don't get lost in a system which can be overwhelming at first. So that's what you should be doing, you should be getting of a child really invested in university life; but there are some things that we encourage you not to do. And the first there is pretty clear; that putting pressure on your child to, you know, achieve a high distinction in every single subject is couldn't be really devastating for a child's development at university or young adults development at university. We see the evidence of that when students write to us or come and see us in tears. And very stressed that they received only a credit. And I say 'only a credit'; a credit for us is a really good grade range. But, that's not good enough, because they've been told by parents or others that you know, you need to be receiving 80 or 90% in each subject or in each assignment, in order to, to do really well and to succeed in the future. Grades, while they're, you know, quite important and clearly, you need to be passing subjects to be getting through your degree they're not the only thing that we're testing. We want to ensure that students are developing a range of skills, and not just how to work a system and learn how to write a really good essay, in order to pass a course; we want them to develop those higher order skills, those critical analysis skills, and you know, collaborative skills. We also ask that parents, carers, family, friends really don't get involved with the assignments to a great degree. So understanding when assignments are due is really important and it can help you develop a discussion with your child, but don't help to edit assignments. And this is a really important thing that Amanda could talk hours about because academic misconduct; so instances of plagiarism, uh, you know, increasing, we see evidence of this every semester. And it often is because students are unaware of the expectations of how to write reports or essays at this level. Sometimes this is not accidental. So, and it is something that we need to really nip in the bud before, you know, in those early stages. So receiving editing, advice from professionals or even family members is a no no, it will mean that we have to refer you on to firstly, breaching academic integrity rules. And then what what else not to do, don't compare your child's university experience to those that have their friends, of family members of your own if you have had a university experience, because any pressure it's just like pressure on grades, any pressure can make it really difficult for a child to flourish. At University though, we know we need to make this as seamless as possible. In the especially in the first year, once a student finds their feet in second and third year, then they'll be able to push off you and tell you where they're at and how confident they are. But in those early years, all they need is some reassurance; they need to be encouraged to navigate their own journey, to figure out what university is like. And a big part of university is not really what happens in the classroom; it's all of the extras, it's the whole package; it's those social relational experiences. So I hope that gives you a little bit of an idea of how parents can get involved at an you know, in an arm's length approach in their child's university life, particularly in those early stages. I think that's all that I had to say, James. Oh, we're up to Q&A. So I think we've met pretty good time. Dr Amanda White Plenty of time for questions. Plenty of time. If anybody does have one... I have put some extra comments there in the chat as well. A lot of students the freedom of university, they're really telling you what to do. Academics don't check in on students the same way that teachers will check in on students in high school. And so I said that it's about 10 hours per subject per week. So if a student is studying for subjects, that's about 40 hours a week, it's like going to work nine to five, a lot of students fall into the trap that the hours that I do face-to-face with my teacher with my class, is the only thing that I need to worry about preparing for. And that is something that results in very shocked students when it comes to results. So if you say, look, going to full time University is like a full time job, then that can often put it in a little bit more context. So if you have any questions, please make sure that you add them into the Q&A there. And I think we've answered pretty much everything or you can pop that in the chat. While were waiting to see if there are any, I often get a lot of questions about what sort of technology etc might be needed. The university provides free Wi-Fi for all of our students who are coming onto campus with their own device. So most students will come to university with their own device, if they don't have one, or one is difficult to afford, then, of course, please contact us at UTS we have loan options for students, in terms of laptops and technology. A lot of times there'll be interaction in the class that might require them to use a mobile device to vote in an online system or engage in an online activity. We also recommend that students bring just really simple things, a lot of students don't come to class with just a small pad of paper and a pen, you never know when you might need a physical pen, even though we do a lot of things online. And the other thing that I would recommend that students will bring to class as well is a water bottle. So we are really trying to be a plastic-free institution. All around campus, there are filtered water bottle refilling stations. So we encourage everyone to bring a water bottle or at orientation, get involved and buy one of our UTS water bottles, I think they're only $15. And they're really great value. James, any other tips you want to share? I think the the key tip that I have is really to, to make the most of the experience, you know, you have to get involved, you know, so you need to encourage your child to, to really explore, you know, the university come to the orientation, you know, find out what university life is all about, you know that there's a lot to learn. And that's what our orientation is really about, you know, finding out about different services, we offer different opportunities to be involved in clubs and societies. And as Simone mentioned, there's so many different clubs and societies that they don't need to join one that's related to their studies. It's largely about networking, meeting other people throughout the university experience. So you know, just choosing one that they're interested in, in some way, and making sure they engage, and then coming to class, and again, be ready to engage the students that perform best are the ones generally, that make an effort to get involved in university life and make the most of it and that greatly improved experience. You know, as we were saying, you know, during high school, I think, as Amanda mentioned, during high school, you know, teachers will push you to do this and that we weren't you know, we're there to support and encourage but, you know, it's up to the student to drive a you know, their experience, and there's, there's a lot they can make of it and so many different opportunities, you know, so yeah, just get involved. And, and it's not just about class time, it's not just about turning up to classes and leaving. It's, it's our campus is here for a reason. So you can do things without experience. Now, there was a question here that said, if students start their business degree, but think they'd like to change to a combined degree or a degree in different faculty, what do they need to think about? So you know, that first semester is really a period of exploration. But if they get to the end of that first semester, and they think this just isn't for me, you know, I started in this degree, and I really don't think it's something that I'm interested in, then I would really suggest dropping in and talking to our careers service. So our Career Service can actually provide really good guidance about well, what career do I want if I thought business might be interesting, but it's not working out for me? So have a chat to Careers. To transfer into a combined degree, what they're going to need to do is after that first semester of study, they'll need to reapply through UAC, they can still stay in their existing UTS degree for now, and then apply into that double degree through UAC. And then if they receive an offer, they can transfer, it's easier to transfer from a double degree. So you're doing a Bachelor of Business with a Bachelor of International Studies, and you think, I'm not interested in doing international studies anymore. It's a really simple, easy, internal process to change from a double degree to a single. But to go from a single to a double degree, using that single as part of the double, it's a little bit more complicated. Or to choose a degree in a different faculty, you'll need to go and reapply through UAC. Now another question here that's a good one for our First Year Experience Coordinators - what sort of industry experience might students be able to get during their degree? What sort of opportunities are there? Dr Simone Faulkner Well, in our faculty, there are quite a few. And in fact, this is very topical, because the theme of this semester has really been work integrated learning experiences across the university, and more of our subjects have some sort of component of will have work integrated learning embedded within those. Now, for example, within the Bachelor of Business, there is a Business Internship subject, which is an elective that and this is also applicable to the Bachelor of Management subject, all students have the option to choose that as an elective in their degree. And there also, I know that both the Bachelor of Management and the Bachelor of Business have undergone quite a bit of a review. So there are new subjects being introduced every year or two, which support that all of our Capstone subjects across each of the departments, whether you're in Marketing or Accounting, Management, they have some sort of project-based assessment or activity that they usually do undertake with an industry partner. And so your students will, you know, benefit from having relationships or develop those networking experiences with any industry partner, and also try to solve a problem for that industry partner as well. And this goes beyond those Capstone subjects. This is happening across the board, as we're, you know, innovating in a lot of the subjects across the degrees. James, did you want to add to that? Dr Amanda White Yeah, sure. I mean, an important part of what we do with UTS Careers, this is a program that students do there generally at the start of their program, although they could do it later on if they want, which basically, they think through designing their UTS experience. And while designing their UTS experience, they're thinking through the skills that they want to learn, the experience, they want to gain to develop industry opportunities, basically, so during their program and post their program. And in saying that, obviously, you know, a lot of you who have kids that are yet to transition to university, and gaining some experience, whatever the work is, is a good thing. You know, employers really look upon this favorably, because it's learning how to work with others, learning how to work with people, be that in our program, and that's good; but of course, employers when you're, you know, want to further your experience will look favorably on, you know, experience in the workplace. So, once once you your child has done and finished their HSC, you know, some of them certainly want to take a break, and that's fine. That's perfectly understandable. And that's an important part of life. But exploring those opportunities and thinking about, you know, a job that only have one is a good thing. And then that will help them build on their thinking around careers and what they want to do moving forward when they come to UTS. And we provide them with the guidance and support around developing those opportunities further. Another thing I wanted to mention as well is we actually have a subject students can take called Business Internships where they go and find an internship. They learn about the world of work, and they report back on their internship. And UTS also advertises for a lot of commercial internships. So for example, in Accounting and Finance and most of our business disciplines, the summer break (we do have summer subjects available on offer) but most of our students use the summer break to actually take a six to 12 week internship in Accounting, those are offered by the big accounting firms, PwC, KPMG, etc. But there are internships available at all sorts of different times to give students some of that experience. And then if the students are just in volunteering, we have lots of programs that give them industry experience in a volunteering manner through build, and other initiatives. So there's lots of options. And a lot of students say to me, look, Amanda, I'm in third year, my only job has been in McDonald's, is that going to be any use in getting a graduate job, and I say, it's a fantastic job. So hospitality roles, retail roles, often students don't actually realize the benefits they're getting from learning how to deal with customers, working in a team, having deadlines, being able to organize themselves. So as well as having industry specific experience don't forget that those part-time jobs can often provide a lot of great real world experience to students as well. Well, we're almost out of time. You can stay connected with us on social media, on Facebook and on Instagram. And also on the UTS Business email address (business@uts.edu.au). One of the team can handle any of your queries and get back to you. Certainly, we thank everybody for being here today. And for asking your questions. It's a really hard thing; University for a lot of parents was taught in a certain way with certain types of experiences if you've been to university, and it's quite different now. For those who have never been to university and not had tertiary education, sometimes trying to figure out what advice to provide for students can be really difficult. So we hope that we've shed some light today on how you can support the person that you care for in coming to university. So we look forward to hopefully welcoming you and your family to UTS then maybe in a few years, perhaps see you're on campus for a graduation. And of course if you need anything else from us, please don't hesitate to get in touch. So thank you very much and have a great evening. Careers in Business 00:00 Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, where we'll be talking about the different careers options available to UTS Business School graduates, as well as the plethora of support services available to students through UTS careers. My name is Rachel and joining me is Nicole Papworth, who is the Business School's very own careers consultant. 00:20 Hi everyone. I'm Nicole, as Rachel just mentioned, I work in the UTS Career's team. I used to work in recruitment so I used to hire interns and graduates into all different roles across different areas in business. Now I work with UTS to help our business students figure out what it is that you want to do with your career and then help you achieve that. 00:39 Nicole, a lot of students in year 12 are thinking about their UAC preferences, what uni they want to go to, what course they want to do, and ultimately what career they want to end up in. But do students need to know right now 100% what they want to do after they graduate? 00:58 Well, pretty much my answer is no, but I've got a really long answer to get there. So I find that students a lot of the time when they're in year 12, or even in their first year of uni, they really want to know exactly what's at the end. So they can plan their whole way. And they can know step one, step two, step three, and exactly what it's going to lead to. But what we find is in reality, you know, you can't predict the future, you can't 100% know that step one is going to lead to step two, which will lead to step three and, and that kind of final answer that you want. It's very comforting to have this kind of step by step and know, think you know the future. But in careers, that's really not what we necessarily kind of promote as career planning. What we say instead, is to really look at yourself and to know yourself, and what it is that you want, and what you can control right now. So a part of this might seem a bit strange. We get people to think back to when you were say five or six, when you're in like kindergarten, and someone said to you, what do you want to be when you grow up? Rachel I'm going to ask you quickly, what did you want to be when you were five? 02:03 When I was five, I wanted to be a teacher, because my mom was a teacher. And I was somewhat bossy. So I thought that would be a good option for me. 02:13 Yeah, actually, lots of people say teachers. And when I was five, I actually wanted to be a policewoman. And what you'll find is that when people are five, they want to be something that they've heard of, so either their parents are that or they've seen that profession, or seen on TV. And what you'll find when you ask people at eight, or maybe nine what they want to be, so by the time I was eight, I wanted to be a ballerina. At the time I was nine I wanted to be a zoologist, just 10 I wanted to be a news reporter. So as you grow and you learn more about yourself, what you're good at, what you like you don't like, as well as what's actually available in the world, and you start to change your mind. So the point I'm getting at here is, if you want to be something when you're five, something different when you're ten, something different by the time you're 15. Do you really think that right now you know exactly what you're going to want to be in the future? Are you really saying that you don't think there's more you can learn about yourself or the world, as you kind of get involved in things? Probably not, you're probably going to change in life. So instead, what we say is really important for careers is to know your strengths, know your weaknesses, what you're good at, what you're interested in, and follow these while you're studying. Because that's actually going to lead to a career which will also be related to what you're good at, what your strengths are. So rather than necessarily knowing exactly what you need to be when you graduate, which I guess was the original question, we say don't worry too much about that. Just focus on what you actually can control right now, and learning more about yourself and getting involved more in the world. So one of the best things also about the UTS Bachelor of Business is that it is so varied. So students really do get to try a lot of different things before they have to say commit to a specific major or a specific area of a career. So I definitely think that's one of the key benefits of UTS Bachelor of Business and before students have to pick them Major as well, there's always quite a few different events run by careers and also by the Business Society and Women in Business around picking your major. So we run different things from panel events, networking, where you get to meet and chat to other students who are in their second and third year doing different majors in marketing, accounting, finance, you can learn more about it. And I think that's really beneficial for students in their first year to do. 04:24 Now, UTS is fortunate to have a very active careers unit to assist students in being work ready. Nicole, can you talk us through what exactly UTS careers is and some of the services they have on offer? 04:38 Yeah, of course. So we have both a virtual service and we also have face to face service. So we offer one to one career coaching sessions, so you can just drop into the careers office when we're open or we've also got these as virtual options as well. You can just book into a 15 minute virtual session and chat with careers consultant and ask anything about if you're not sure what you want to study, you're not sure if you like subjects or you want help getting a part time job or updating your resume, or maybe you've not heard of LinkedIn before. We also offer programs, we've got lots of different workshops and things you can get involved with. And that might be creating a resume, it might be built, meeting different alumni and people professionals, we industries, hearing about what jobs actually are, we also run mentoring programs. And there's so many things. So there's lots of online activities, as well as quite a few different face to face activities run throughout the year. 05:33 So Nicole, you've given our future students some wonderful advice. But if there's just one tip that you wanted to give to students who are currently in year 12, and thinking about their future, what would that be? 05:45 The passion is the result of action, not the cause of it. That might sound a bit weird, but essentially what I'm saying is you don't figure out what you're passionate about by just thinking about things. You figure out what you're passionate about by doing and getting involved in things. So think about whatever you're most interested in right now, whether it's skateboarding, whether it's a specific genre of movies, you didn't just one day wake up and realize you're passionate about it, you started doing it and got involved and then realized you loved it. So my one piece of advice is, while you're finishing off high school, or as you start university in your first year, just get involved and do a few things that you maybe hadn't thought of, to try and help you figure out what your new passions and interests might be. 06:29 Thank you so much for your time and for for all of your advice about career paths for UTS Business School graduates. 06:36 You're welcome, Rach.

Thank you UTS Business School Student Experience 00:00 Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining us today where we'll be talking about the UTS Business School student experience. My name is Rachel and joining me is Jasmine who's studying the combined Bachelor of Business, Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation. And Patricia, who's studying the Bachelor of Business Bachelor of Laws. Jasmine, did you always know that you wanted to do business or were you umm-ing and ahh-ing up until d-day? 00:28 Um, so for me, it was a little bit interesting. I actually never really wanted to do business because both my parents did business and I kind of thought to myself, I'd like to be a little bit different. But when it came around to choosing on the night of the first UAC preferences, I was that person that was up till midnight, changing all my preferences and changing around the order and punching in numbers and really down to the last minute trying to change what I really thought that I wanted to do. But in the end, what I did do was put UTS at the top of my preference list, and I did get an offer for my degree which is Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of Creative Intelligence Innovation. But even after getting the offer, I still wasn't completely sure what I wanted to do. And so I did get a couple of offers in later rounds as well. But in the end, it just came down to me having a look at all the unis, doing my research, making sure I knew exactly what it was about the courses that I was looking for. And what I did was even still choosing UTS I wasn't 100% sure, but once they came and started, I knew that it was going to be something that I liked. And so I stuck with it. And I've obviously, if you've attended some of the other sessions, you know, I changed my majors and my sub majors a little bit. I still kind of now don't completely know what I want to do, even when I finish but I found that business at UTS as well as my double with Creative Intelligence and Innovation is a great mix of subjects for me, even as someone who didn't really know what they were going to do, and still kind of doesn't know what they're gonna do moving forward. 01:55 Now, you mentioned you're obviously doing a combined degree with Business and Creative Intelligence and Innovation, we get a lot of questions about what exactly is Creative Intelligence and Innovation? So can you talk us through that side of your degree and what it involves? 02:11 The title doesn't really tell you about completely what it is. It's basically teaching, I guess, entrepreneurship and how to come up with ideas and problem solve in a really practical sense. And so it's more based around like your assignments. For example, one of my assignments was based around an industry partner MasterCard, and they came in and they wanted to know how they could increase their sales around the globe moving forward. And so there are a whole bunch of ideas from different groups, but that was our assignment. It's a whole lot of butcher's paper and post-it notes. It's not really that sit down and listen to lectures and listen to people talk. It's very much a hands-on degree, really thinking, really switching on and trying to come up with solutions to different ideas. 02:55 And Patricia, you're doing another one of our combined degrees, Business and Laws which is a really popular option as well. Can you talk us through it? Is this something that you always knew you wanted to study? And how is your degree structured? 03:09 So, I guess in Year 12, I didn't really have a clear idea of what I wanted to do at uni. I had like a lot of, you know, back and forth decisions about what I want to study, whether it'd be like something towards business, or maybe even science or, you know, engineering and stuff like that. But I think what really sold me to business or like commerce, I think that kind of field was the flexibility and, you know, the ability to kind of study a degree and have the options kind of move into different kind of career paths, you're not really stuck into one thing just because you studied business. And I think, with my law side, of my degree, I didn't really, I guess, have a clear goal of going into law when I was in Year 12. I think, especially, you know, with the admission and kind of like the details surrounding that I wasn't too sure whether or not I'd be able to study law in uni and I think, just like getting the offer at UTS really pushed me to come to UTS to study the double, as opposed to just studying commerce say at some other uni, which is why I'm here today. And with my double degree, it is structured a bit differently to say, the Business and BCII degree. With the business and law, we don't do intensive courses in the Summer and Winter, all our subjects are, you know, during the normal Spring and Autumn sessions, like many other degrees, and as opposed to Business/BCII, Business Law is a five year degree. Something that's also a bit unique to the Business/Law double is that with the business component, you only get one major as opposed to having, you know, the flexibility of having two majors or a major and a sub-major. So, for me, I'm majoring in finance and all my business subjects after first year are allocated to the finance major. So I don't have any other, I guess, spare electives to kind of explore any other, I guess, different aspects of the business degree, whereas my law degree is still I guess, the same tip length that you'd expect from a law degree. It's the same if you would do like a single loterie. So there's no really compromise there on that side. And yeah, that's like, I guess something that's a bit unique to the bachelor business and the actual laws. 05:12 Patricia, what have been some of the big differences you've noticed moving from high school to uni? 05:19 Yeah, so coming to uni was definitely a really big jump from high school. You know, when you're in high school, especially in Year 12 at a place where you're very comfortable in, I guess, where you are at life, you kind of know everyone, you know, your teachers, you have this whole community that you kind of built up throughout your whole, I guess, schooling experience and coming to uni, it's definitely a fresh start. And I think one of the biggest things that was really different from high school was, I guess, the amount of independence they kind of had around, you know, your studying and kind of this whole like socializing and making friends. You really had a lot of independence on how you wanted to structure I guess your unique experience, you know, and that's something that I kind of did struggle with a bit in my first year in not having teachers kind of hounding on you, like, every, every other day being like 'oh your assignments are due', or 'you have this homework coming up', I think it was something that I had to really adapt to kind of making my own schedules and really sticking to them and being really disciplined in, you know, making sure that I go to class and attend all my lectures and tutorials, as opposed to kind of, you know, expecting someone to kind of just always be following up on me. But I think that's something that definitely gets a lot easier as you kind of go on, you know, throughout the semester and throughout your uni degree, you get really accustomed to kind of just having more time to yourself and having more time to really organize and really do uni the way that you want to do it. And I think that's a really good thing that you know, is to like, I guess, learn, kind of within that transition period, just how to, I guess be more organized and be more independent, which is something that is really good. 06:53 I really found that um, I guess Patricia kind of touched on this as well, but really the scheduling around uni was quite for me. When you go to school, you've got your timetable, and while you might pick some electives, you kind of at school, you know, for me, it was 8:30 till 3:15, you've got a scheduled lunchtime and you've got a scheduled recess. And, you know, you might have sport on a Wednesday afternoon or whatever it might be moving towards uni, you really get to customize that timetable around what works for you. So for me, when I was in my first year of uni, I had a part time job, and I was working four days a week. So what I ended up doing was I did one day at uni. And then I also did some night classes at uni so that I could still keep those four days at work. And that worked really well for me in the first semester first year. And then as I moved into my second year, and my third year as well, I'm starting to realize that I don't need to work. And I'm working three days at the moment so I can go two full days at uni. And so I guess the ability to customize that timetable around what you want, and what you need is something that I found really interesting and I guess the ability to have multiple things going at one time, particularly with business, it's, I guess, less hands-on than some other degrees. So a lot of it is you just go into uni and you learn what you need to do and what you need to know, I guess, and you go home and you can go over in your own time. And it sort of takes a little bit more self motivation than what would happen at school, you know, you're forced to go to school for the set hours every single day, and they teach you a lot more there because you've got more time there. Whereas I feel like when you've got this new timetable and ability to customize it around different hours, then you have to kind of split in that extra study time yourself and you get to mold that around what your schedule looks like day to day. So that was one thing I found really different was, I guess the ability to customize and also the need for self motivation to get through all the work within a semester. 08:45 How much time on average would you spend studying when you're not in a lecture or a tutorial? 08:52 I think with uni really the marks you get are really what you put in so you could put in a minimal effort and just get a pass in a subject, you probably wouldn't have to do that much work outside of your class hours. But for me, I'd prefer to have sort of like a distinction average. So I'm not necessarily achieving for full marks in every subject, I kind of aim to do quite well. But I also still want to have time to do my own sort of thing and I don't want to be stuck to my desk all the time. So I would say I have around 3 hours face-to-face teaching for each class, and I do four classes in a semester. I think usually in the start of the semester, you don't have to do too much study. But as you come in towards assessments and exams at the back-end of the semester, you tend to put a little bit more time into it. I'd say I probably maybe do an hour extra for each subject in general, and then a couple extra hours when we're in kind of those periods within the semester. That's me personally, I know everyone does study differently. But I found that that's what works for me. 09:55 A lot of people that aren't at uni yet aren't quite sure what exactly a lecture is and what a tute or tutorial is. Patricia, what's the difference between the two of them? 10:07 So a lecture is one of those bigger, I guess, more typical sessions that you think of when you come to uni. It's like a really big hall with a lot of students. And there's one, I guess, lecturer, who's going through the content, it might take, maybe like, a few, a couple hours, depending on the subject, but it's definitely usually a very one-way kind of teaching style where there lecturer kind of, you know, teaches you the content, and it's kind of not really an interactive space. But on the other hand, a tutorial is definitely something that's a bit more hands-on. It's a smaller classroom, maybe around 30 students or less something that you'd be more, I guess, accustomed to is similar to like a high school classroom, I'd say. And it's definitely something that's much more like a two-way conversation where you're able to ask your tutor questions, go through the content that you maybe didn't really understand throughout the week, and then kind of explaining things in more detail and really going through the content, and taking more time to go through it with you. So those are like, I guess the two main types of classes that you'd have at uni. 11:13 Exactly how formal is it when you're liaising with your academic staff? Jasmine, what do you call them? 11:21 I think for most, the most part they like to actually be referred to with their first name. A lot of them are really well accomplished academics. They might be Professor and Doctor and they might have a PhD and all these sorts of things. But in general, I guess in email etiquette, you would probably if you were emailing your tutor, just say 'Hi Peter' or 'Dear Peter,' and continue with your email. I think a lot of the time, the academics as much as they are very intelligent, well accomplished people., they're really here to help the students and so by forming those, I guess relationships with their students, you're able to reach out and get help when you need to, and they're not going to come down on you if you don't use the right name or you make a spelling mistake. I think as much as it's nice to be formal with your academics and your tutors, it's good to also have a relationship where you can ask questions and feel like you can get the help that you need as well. 12:12 How maths-heavy is the Bachelor of Business? 12:17 I definitely think it really does depend on the subject. There are some of the first year subjects for example, finance and also a subject called Business Statistics. They're a little bit more maths-focused. But as someone I did, personally three unit maths in high school, and I sat next to a friend from high school who did general maths in that Business Statistics subject, I feel it was a little bit 50/50, some of the maths that she knew really well was in the course some of the maths that I knew really well was in the course. But I guess in general the consensus is that all of the subjects tend to go over again the calculations and go over how to get there in the subject. So if you need to use a certain type of equation or you need to use some sort of calculation, they're going to explain that to you, they're going to go through it. And if you do need extra help that is available UPASS is the program that Patricia mentioned, where you can go and get extra help that's available to you, your tutors are there. You can also ask your peers, my friend and I that did opposite maths in school, we kind of bounced off each other and got through the semester by learning together, as well as going to those UPASS sessions together. And so I guess while there is maths in the course, it definitely shouldn't be something that freaks you out. There's a reason it's not a prerequisite for our course, there is some assumed knowledge, but they're always going to go over it and there's always options available for you to get more help if you do need it. And so I definitely would say that yes, there is maths in the course, but it's not something to freak out about. 13:42 A huge part of uni is the social side and not just the extracurriculars on offer but even just making friends in general. Patricia did you know anyone when you started uni, did you have a big group that came from high school? How did you make friends when you started here? 14:02 14:02 14:02 Yes. So when I started uni, I didn't really know anyone, I guess from my high school that was coming to UTS and studying the same, I guess, degree that I was, you know, there were some people who were studying maybe like Nursing or Engineering, but we weren't really close. So I was kind of coming into uni with like a blank slate not really knowing many people. And I think it was also like, really kind of daunting, you know, just coming in not like without a group of friends, but uni does really give you the environments kind of make friends, you know, especially in your first year, everyone's really in the same boat, kind of just wanting to expand their social circles and just wanting to get to know each other. And a lot of the friends that I've made at uni have really been from my first year classes, you know, you sit next to people in your first few classes and you kind of just have the environment to really talk to them and really add like, you know, strike up conversations at them on Facebook and on social media and really develop those relationships from there. And yes, it really wasn't as daunting as I thought it would be. And, you know, it was really nice kind of just being around people who will kind of in similar situations as you try to just, you know, live their best uni life and make make friends and things like that. 15:09 Jasmine, do you want to talk us through which clubs and societies that you've been involved in? And how you found them? 15:17 Yeah, definitely, I think, coming into uni, that was one of the biggest things I was excited about. I was that student that was first at the door on open day and I was going around all the stalls looking at all societies. I was actually kind of blown away about how many there are on offer. We've got a Quidditch club, there's food appreciation, beer appreciation. There's also one specific to the degree that you're studying. So if you're a nursing student as the nursing society for us in business, we've got the business society we also have the Women in Business society, there's a whole host of other ones around finance, investment, all niches within business. So there's definitely something for everyone and I found that it was one of those things that really did help me as well. Just to go back to that finding friends and socializing, it's definitely a place that you can find like-minded people. If you sign up for a society, you're immediately going to meet new people that host events and parties and all those sorts of things. And it's a great way to get yourself out there and meet people who are interested in the same things as you. I personally signed up for a few when I went to the first open day, there are lots of clubs on offer, usually they charge around $5 or $10 for a membership fee. I signed up to the business society, I also signed up for women in business. And by the end of that I actually became involved in their committee. So I guess organizing the events and helping behind the scenes with those sorts of things. And so that was a really great way for me to meet lots of people that I'm still really good friends with now and it's always nice when you walk into class and you see a familiar face and have someone to sit next to after you've kind of done your first little semester at uni. When you walk into those classes moving forward, you know that there's someone there that you'll most likely know. And even when you're online and you see you know the names of the people in your subject or in your tutorial, if there's someone you know, it's kind of a nice feeling that you'll have someone there throughout the whole semester in that subject to always bounce off and make sure everything's going okay. So I definitely would recommend if you're interested in societies definitely go and have a look, there is absolutely something for everyone. There are so many out there, and it's a great way to get involved in uni life. 17:26 Yes, so. Like Jasmine, I also, you know, went around O-Day my first year and kind of looked at the different clubs and societies that were on offer at UTS. And the one that I was particularly involved in within my first few years was Enactus, which is basically like a student society dedicated to getting students involved in social entrepreneurship and kind of giving them the environment, tools and networks kind of create their own social enterprise. And I joined in my first few weeks of first semester in first year, and I've been involved with Enactus ever since so last year, I had the opportunity to become the president of Enactus UTS, which was a really great experience. You know, it really got me involved in kind of the leadership side of societies and really opened my eyes to like how much work, I guess a society does entail and I think it was a really good learning experience for me. And even now, after my presidency, has like, I guess, finished, I've still been in contact with the people in the society, still attending events and really helping, you know, the society out I think, even if you're not involved in committees or executive team, there's definitely a lot of ways to get involved in a student society or a club and I think that's something that UTS does really well with the amount that have been offered as well. 18:43 Now, UniGames is another thing that a lot of people have heard about, but might not necessarily know too much about. Jasmine, you've actually been. Can you talk us through exactly what UniGames is and what your experience with that has been? 18:59 Absolutely, I've been to UniGames twice for two different sports so I can definitely vouch for how fun and exciting the week is. Basically UniGames, it's now called National Div-1 University Championships is what UTS competes in. It's basically a congregation of all Australian universities and we play sport against each other in a whole bunch of different categories. I believe there's even ping-pong and fencing, swimming, even surfing. So there's definitely a sport for everyone. I went the first year in my first year of uni, actually, the first one that I went for was softball. And so we played I think, from Monday through Friday, and then at the end of the week, there was awards given out and actually in that year, UTS won the overall sport competition, which was really exciting. Last year, I ended up going for dance. So that was a little bit different again, because you don't really just train you have to learn the routines in the lead up. And so that was kind of a longer commitment for me in the lead up to uni games, but I really enjoyed it. That experience again, it's one of those things where you get to meet like-minded people. And I became really close with my group of dance friends. So we got to go up to Queensland for the week, same as last time, although we competed at different venues. And there's lots of things going on as sponsors like UniBank, you can you play frisbee games and you can win money and it's just, it's just a great atmosphere. You go up there, you get to watch other sports, you get to watch other UTS teams play. And it's just a really fun week. And it allows you to kind of get out of your comfort zone and try something new. I mean, I've been twice so I can definitely vouch for the fact that it's a lot of fun. And I got a lot out of it. Hopefully I can go again next year. 20:40 Patrcia, what's your favorite spot either on or around campus to grab something to eat? 20:46 Yeah, we're definitely spoilt for choice in terms of food and drink and places to kind of hang out with your friends around UTS. I think that's a big benefit of us being so central within the city. I know my first year of uni I hung out a lot around the Haymarket side of campus so around where the old UTS library used to be. And one of my favorite places to go grab food was Jumbo Thai. And I like I think every UTS student can vouch for Jumbo Thai, definitely the best takeaway that you'll get for the price. I kind of miss it, haven't been in a long time since lockdown as occurred but it was definitely a like an essential part of being a UTS student going to Jumbo Thai before class or, you know, bringing Jumbo Thai takeaway to the library and stinking the whole place up. Definitely a really, really good place. But now that the new building has opened, Building 2, the food court is definitely the place to go, you know, they've got like Papa Rich, you've got Cha Time you've got Uni Bros there's a lot of options for food. And it's definitely a really good place to go if you're, you know, on campus or you're just around class and stuff like that. 21:53 I actually also do enjoy Spice Alley so it's kind of more towards the central building and the iconic tower that everyone knows, that massive brown one in the middle of Central. So to walk across from there to Jumbo, sorry not Jumbo Thai, sorry to Spice Alley is a really great place to go. There's lots of options there. You can sit down, it's really pretty. And then there's also a little oval out the back. Another favorite for me is after I've had a good feed at Jumbo Thai or either at Spice Alley is to walk around the back, there's an ice cream place called Anita's and they have so many flavors that are all amazing and it's just a perfect way to top off a great lunch after uni or before class. It's just a really good spot around there. 22:38 One of the things that we really emphasise at UTS is being work ready, and a big part of that is we really encourage our students wherever possible to complete an internship. So Patricia, do you want to just tell us a little bit about the internship you did, how you found that, the kind of work you were doing? 22:58 I recently completed an internship with Suncorp Group as a Finance Intern, I completed a seven week internship over the Summer and I found that placement through the CA Achiever Program. So I don't know if anyone has heard of Chartered Accountants. It's like this organization for accounting and finance professionals. And they have a program they run every year for students, which allows them to, I guess, intern with the different partners that they have. So I was able to secure an internship with Suncorp Group through the Achievement Program. And at the end of the seven weeks, I was actually able to convert that internship into a part-time role which I was able to get credited as a subject as part of my degree as part of the Business Internship subject. And in my internship, I guess I was doing I guess, more of like financial accounting work and I was helping their Wealth and Assurance teams with that, you know, their monthly reporting, their monthly journals and, you know, similar administrative and kind of like accounting work on that side. And yeah, it's been a really good experience kind of getting the practical, I guess, hands-on experience that you can't really get from just a classroom. And I think it's allowed me to kind of apply the things that I've learned from uni to kind of a workplace scenario, which is really good. 24:16 The way that I ended up with my internship was actually through a society event. So the Women in Business society runs an annual event with all of their industry sponsors, and this company that I got my internship with named Amstelveen and they were attending that event. So I was actually sitting down with lunch with some of these employees from Amstelveen and they mentioned about this internship program that we're thinking of getting up and running. And they encouraged me to apply. And so from that I did apply, I had a few interviews, and I ended up getting the role. So it was a little bit less conventional than kind of just going through a standard internship application. But I guess in the end, the internship that I got was actually very interesting. The area that they specialize in, they're a boutique risk management firm. So I did a lot of consulting work within that I was working on Big Four clients in insurance firms, I also do some of the internal marketing. So it was kind of a split role between doing some stuff internally as well as moving out to client offices. But it was really interesting, they're kind of a more small company compared to somewhere like Suncorp. But it was a great experience, a great way to kind of just build those soft skills that you wouldn't even think about, you know, when's the appropriate time to text someone? When's the perfect time to send an email? How do I use Microsoft Teams? When should we be doing a group call? I guess these sorts of small things that you wouldn't really think about was something that I really thought was helpful to me to pick up before I enter the workforce more officially when I finished my degree. So I felt that was a really good experience for me to kind of just validate what I've been learning at uni and see how that manifests in real life. And also just to get a taste of different industries I'm planning on doing another internship this Summer. Personally, I didn't get it accredited to my degree just because it was something that I did over the Summer. I was paid for it. So I didn't feel like I needed to get any credit for a subject. But that is possible. And Patricia has done that. So there are options for you when you do decide if you want to do an internship that you can get credited, or you can just do it on your own accord, if you'd like as well. So I guess it was a really positive experience for me. And in saying that, I'd encourage you all to do that too, if you choose to do a Bachelor of Business. 26:26 One thing I do want to add, though, is that when you do do it as part of your as part of your course, like Patricia did, UTS has to sign off on your workplan. So you're getting credit towards your degree, as Patricia spoke about. So we want to make sure that you're actually learning something, we don't want you to say, 'Yeah, I didn't learn anything about finance, but I make a really good latte' or 'I'm really good at photocopying'. So we do sign off on on that workplan to make sure that you are learning something that will add something to your degree. 27:02 One service at UTS really worth mentioning is UTS Careers. Patricia, I know you've done a lot with them, you've actually worked with them. Can you talk us through a little bit about what Careers is and the services and help that they provide for students? 27:19 Yeah, so UTS Careers that's definitely one of UTS' best student services like helping students get ready for a job or, you know, career also they finished their studies at UTS. And I've worked a lot with Careers, whether it's through you know, student societies or you know, working as an intern, I've definitely interacted a lot with their services and I can definitely say that they work really hard to ensure that UTS students are getting the best out of their, I guess university experience and getting the best out of UTS' network with industries and academics and partners and things like that and it definitely is a really good service. UTS Careers I guess provides a lot of different services to students, you know, they've got their drop-in centers where you can kind of come in with like a 15 minute session and go over your resume or cover letter or any kind of queries that you have regarding interviews or just jobs and like the application process. They definitely cover a lot of different topics, or they have more structured services like their Accomplish Award, which is a semester-long, I guess program, which allows students to kind of interact with industry, mentors and industry guests and really hone their skills in like, kind of interviewing skills or application skills and really just getting them ready for that initial process of getting a job. And they also offer other like events, and I guess programs which kind of run on a year semester basis. They've got different things that cater to different degrees, not just the Bachelor of Business, they've got, you know, Nursing, Engineering, IT all these different events that they run to kind of just help students really get out there, network and really expand their industry I guess connections and it's really, it really is helpful for students to kind of, you know, expand their networks that way. 29:07 Patricia, what would your advice be to students that are currently sitting their HSC? 29:14 The biggest thing that I would, I guess, say to current HSC students would, I guess be to not stress out too much. I know, this is such a, you know, classic thing that people say to all HSC students, like, you know, don't stress out, it's not the end of the world. But I think, you know, having gone through that, and really, you know, having gone through the first few years of uni, HSC really isn't the end like there are so many different pathways to kind of go through if you know, the HSC doesn't work out for you, if your ATAR doesn't meet the requirements for certain courses that you want, you know, there are a lot of different ways to kind of get to where you want to be. And I think while you're in the position, like we have the time, you know, do your research on alternative pathways to kind of just have this backup plan or contingency plan to make sure that you know, you kind of know what is out there to kind of get to where you want to be. And I think that's the biggest thing you could do to kind of relieve that stress, especially in your final year, you know, not having to worry about just, you know, focusing on your HSC as opposed to kind of worrying about whether or not you're able to get into uni. I think doing your research now would be such a good thing to kind of, you know, keep in the back of your mind as you're approaching those final few months. And really, just reassure yourself that, you know, it isn't the end of you know, your journey, it kind of is just a little point in the road, you can kind of go wherever you want to be as long as you kind of just know where your I guess end goal is. 30:38 I guess my advice and it kind of is related to the position I was in when I was finishing year 12. It's just, I guess, to keep in mind that it's okay to not know what you want. You know, when you come to uni, there are so many options. It's so flexible to change even between degrees, between unis, change your majors. I think it's just important to remember that again, like Patricia said, it's not the end, you know, you can work really hard for your HSC and get a mark and then start uni. And if it's not what you like, you can easily change. And that's exactly what you should keep in the back of your mind. I know a lot of people are apprehensive about coming to university if they're not fully sure about what they want to do. But sometimes it's really just a case of try before you buy, just give something ago. Even if you don't like it after one semester, usually, you can get credit for those subjects in a new degree and you can transfer into a different major, I just think it's really important to keep in mind that it's not the end, you don't have to know exactly what you want to do, you're not expected to know exactly what you want to do. It's okay to start something and just see where it goes. And there's so many options available to you moving forward to, I guess change or alter your study plan. And even if you don't want to stop now, if you want to take a gap year, just think about what it is that you're really after from your uni experience and I guess go from there. Things you like and things you're good at are a really good way to kind of start thinking about what you might like to try and then just go from there. 32:07 Jasmine, Patricia, thank you so much for your time. And thank you everyone for tuning in. Please feel free to explore our other videos detailing our courses and majors. If you have any questions, you can reach out to us via our social media channels, or you can contact us directly by phone 95143074 or email business@uts.edu.au. Thanks so much. Mature age or postgraduate Business student? 00:00 Well, thank you everybody for joining us for this video. Today we're going to be discussing the options that are available should you be choosing between an undergraduate and postgraduate study at UTS Business School. We'll discuss the relative merits between each of those and help you choose the one that best meets your individual needs. So my name is John Elliott, and joining me today are my colleagues Rachel Sidoti and Sam Nugent. Well, we all work within the marketing and student recruitment team here at UTS Business School. And between us we've had about, sort of, you know, a couple of decades of answering questions about this very topic, and we get this question quite a lot. So broadly speaking, if you had some professional experience, you may be considering either doing a bachelor's degree, such as a Bachelor of Business, or doing a postgraduate degree, either a Graduate Certificate as an entry point to a longer degree such as a Master's degree or maybe stopping at a Graduate Diploma. Now we have specific sessions and videos on each of our individual programs. So we're not going to go into too much detail about all of our programs today. But you can see just from the slide here, there's a massive range of programs available to undergraduate and postgraduate level, including our MBA, our Bachelor of Business and a whole range of combined degrees, mainly at the undergraduate level. At the undergraduate level at UTS Business School, we have our Bachelor of Business plus a range of other specialized undergraduate degrees and combined degrees. At the postgraduate level, we have our MBA, which is a little bit like the Bachelor of Business but at postgraduate level, plus a whole range of specialized programs across a whole range of areas like accounting, finance, business analytics, marketing, HR and whole range of management specializations. In terms of the experience that you need to get into a post graduate or undergraduate program, Rachel, the first big question we need to cover off is how much experience do you need to even consider doing postgraduate study with UTS Business School? 02:17 So for most of our Graduate Certificates, you need four years full time professional work experience, or pro rata for part time work experience. So just to reiterate, it needs to be professional work experience. So if, for example, you know, you've been babysitting since you were 12, and doing odd hours here and there, that's not something that we would generally take as professional work experience. As opposed to, if you're working in an office or something similar. 02:50 And do students need to sit some form of GMAT or anything like that to prepare themselves for postgraduate entry? 02:57 No, you don't need to sit a GMAT or do any kind of test for admission, you do need to produce documentation to validate your work experience. So you'll need to include your resume, as well as a statement of service from your employer. 03:10 For a lot of people choosing work over University straight out of school may have been a financial decision or based on their HSC results. What options are there for entry for people with professional work experience? 03:26 Yes, so the Bachelor of Business is the most popular choice for first preferences via UAC which means despite being a lot of offers made, this puts an upward pressure on ATAR cut offs, however for people with work experience, even only one year full time or equivalent, however recent, professional experience may receive five adjustment points to add to their original ATAR. So for people with more experience, but perhaps even no ATAR you can undertake a special tertiary admissions test, a STAT test, which is an online assessment ranging in the skills useful for university such as critical thinking, understanding and analyzing information, rather than specific academic content. 04:08 If you're eligible for both, whether you choose undergraduate or postgraduate qualification is dependent on your individual needs and your individual situation. So, some of the advantages of choosing a Bachelor of Business, for instance, over postgraduate might include the subjects that are taught, they tend to be at a fairly introductory level. We don't assume you've ever studied business before, or economics or anything like that when you're starting with the Bachelor of Business. And that broad core gives you a good understanding of all the business areas that you need to know. So even if you know you don't want to be an accountant, you'll learn enough within that program to be able to talk to the people who are accountants, as you progress through your career. With a three year bachelor's degree, there are roughly 24 subjects, usually, that give you the flexibility and choice so you can do two majors, you can do a major and sub majors, the whole range of electives. So it really allows you to pick and choose a program that suits your needs, and how those needs might change over the time. Now, that flexibility also extends to the way you pace your degree. We'll talk a little bit more about that later on. Another thing to consider is that undergraduate students tend to be a little bit more social. We have a very active postgraduate business society, but most clubs and societies tend to be focused on undergraduate students, especially our business society. This is because postgraduate students tend to juggle work and life with their study commitments, so they're less likely to, you know, kind of hang out on campus. Now that might be an issue for you or it might not, but it's worth considering. Another thing to consider is that the Bachelor of Business has a fantastic reputation. We had our first intake into this program in the mid 70s, and the alumni list of that is like a who's who in business. So you're joining a pretty elite group of people or business leaders in just about every sector, all over the world with a really well known qualification. And then the final thing you might want to think about for the undergraduate choice, is that undergraduate study being Commonwealth-supported tends to be a wee bit cheaper per subject. We'll talk a little bit more about that later as well. 06:36 Now for postgraduate, the advantages might include that most of our courses in postgraduate allow for career transition into new business fields, as well as building on your existing knowledge. So they assume that you're bringing a little bit of professional experience in there with you. Now, this is an important element in that the cohort that you're going to be studying with are going to be business professionals as well. And you'll find yourself learning as much from those students and their experience as you do working from our academics as well. Now, Graduate Certificates are only 24 credit points, which for most of our courses, means only four subjects. Now, what this means is that you can complete this full time in only one session or semester, or part time you can complete it in under a year. That's a great way to, sort of, get a qualification without necessarily committing to a long period of study for your degree, it also means that you have exit points along the way. So, for instance, even if you do want to do a full MBA, which is you know, 16 subjects or 96 credit points, if you decide after a year part time that you don't want to continue with that, you can actually exit with those first four subjects as the Graduate Certificate, or in many cases, halfway through with a Graduate Diploma as well. So it provides you that little bit of flexibility. By comparison with a bachelor's degree, if you exit before it finishes, you just don't have a degree. You have to keep going to get the whole Bachelor of Business, there's no diploma or anything like that halfway through. The only exception to that is the Bachelor of Business Administration, which is a unique program aimed at Indigenous Australian professionals. And the final advantage, potentially, of doing postgraduate is that you can specialize from day one if you like. If you know you need to formalize your knowledge in marketing, or supply chain management, or any of those sorts of things. You can actually do that from day one, get the knowledge you need right now to be better at your job. There isn't that need to get that broad education, it's really useful, but if all you know you want to do is just get your head around some really key concepts in one field, postgraduate might be a bit more useful for you in that. Now, undergraduate business study at UTS, as at all Australian universities, is Commonwealth supported or CSP funded for local students. Now, what this means for you is that in 2020, it's going to cost you $11,155 for a full time load, that equates to just under $1400 per subject. Now, in 2021, there's a proposal that that might go up a wee bit closer to $14,500, or just over $1800, for commencing, for students that might commence in 2021. But that's how much it's going to cost you to do an undergraduate business qualification anywhere in Australia. By comparison, postgraduate study at UTS, and all Australian universities in business, is not, it's funded entirely by you the student. So, the fees can tend to be a little bit higher. And they're certainly worth having a look at all the different universities to see how the bigger ranging fees, but UTS, again, in 2020, our fees for the full year are about $32,500, or just over $4,000 per subject, it's going to be a nominal increase in 2021, in the range of about $100 per subject. But while you pay more per subject for undergraduate study, you do less subjects so that difference isn't quite so pronounced. So at 2020 prices, a full bachelor's degree is going to set you back about $33,500, an MBA will cost around $65,000. But we have shorter programs and specialist degrees that are closer to that sort of $45 - 49,000 mark, which means that the difference between an postgraduate qualification, in many cases, and an undergraduate degree isn't quite as pronounced. Now, really importantly, if you're an Australian citizen, regardless of whether you're doing undergraduate or postgraduate, you can use Study Assist to defer those fees and then pay them back later on when you're earning money etc. Coming back to university is more than just a financial commitment. It's also a commitment in time. So Sam, do both of the options allow you to study at night time? 11:37 So yes and no, John. Our postgraduate courses are specifically designed to fit around the working lives of professionals. So they're either taught at night, on weekends, or in an intensive block. You can definitely continue to work full time while doing a Graduate Certificate or Master's degree. There are some undergraduate subjects taught at night, but, especially when you get down to the elective subjects where there are typically less students, you'll need to come in during the day for some of them. You can check out an idea of what your timetable will look like just by googling UTS timetable planner, and then seeing when the subjects are taught. You'll need the subject codes or the names, so make sure you've got the UTS handbook open as well or the course website. 12:18 And Rachel, how many hours per week are we looking at, to study for either undergraduate or postgraduate? 12:25 So, it all depends on how many subjects you're doing per session. So, if you're enrolled as a full time student, that generally means that you do four subjects per session. Each subject is three hours of face to face learning. So, if you're enrolled as a full time student, and you're doing four subjects, that's 12 hours per week of face to face classes. If you're only doing part time, which is what a lot of our post grad students do, which is two subjects, so six hours across the week, face to face, you can do that. And you can generally choose to vary how many subjects you do each session. So, you might want to do four in autumn. You might be really busy at work, so you might choose to do two in spring, and then maybe pick up one over the summer. So, it doesn't change, again, in terms of those face to face hours. But you can stagger your timetable that way. So, that's how it works in terms of formal teaching. In terms of the study that you do outside of formal classes, the general rule is one and a half hours for every one hour of face to face content. So, this can be quite subjective. It really depends on your affinity with the subject matter. So, if you're really great at maths for instance, and you're studying business statistics, that content may come a lot more naturally to you. So, you may not need to spend as much time on it. It also depends on what you want to get out of your degree. So, if you're really aiming for a high distinction or distinction average, then generally you'd need to put in a lot more time than someone who just wants to get a pass and just wants that piece of paper. So, it's really up to you. But the advice is always the more you put in, the more you're going to get out of it. And that's what our recommendation would generally be as well. 14:24 Now, Rachel, does it cost more or take longer to do a Master's degree using the, sort of, Graduate Certificate as a, sort of, an entry point into them? 14:36 Absolutely not. So, with the Graduate Certificate, it's what we call a nested degree, which means that it's the first generally four subjects of the master's degree. So, you'll be sitting with students that are doing the Graduate Diploma or Master's, it's all the same content. The only thing you need to make sure you do is satisfactorily pass those subjects and then it's just a simple matter of applying through the Student Centre and completing the remainder of those subjects. 15:06 So, depending on your situation, there is no right or wrong answer to whether you should do an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification. But there are a couple of things that you might want to consider when thinking about it. One of these is your age. Now, the average age of people commencing an undergraduate degree is somewhere between 17 to 21. So, you're going to be studying with a much younger cohort there. The average age of people commencing postgraduate ranges fairly significantly from sort of mid 20s right up to the late 30s, depending on the program. So, what you need to think about is what age group you're going to be more comfortable studying with, hanging out with, you know, learning with, etc, as you go through your degree. 15:55 You might also want to consider how much time you have. So if you're studying part time, a Bachelor of Business can end up taking six years or more. Whereas if you're looking at doing a Graduate Certificate, even part time you can you can finish that within 12 months. 16:12 Lastly, we would say whether the specialization you want is available an undergraduate or postgraduate level. For example, financial planning, business analytics, behavioral economics, strategic supply chain management are all only available at a postgraduate level. Whereas tourism and digital creative enterprise management are only available within the Bachelor of Management. 16:34 So, in summary, whether you choose to study undergraduate business or postgraduate business, may come down to a couple of things that might come down to what program you're eligible for, which one suits your interests the most, which one suits your availability, the amount of time you're willing to commit to study, and ultimately, what experience you want to get out of the investment you're making in designing your professional future. So lastly, Rachel, what's your tip for students about making that final decision about which course is right for them? 17:09 My tip would be to do your research and make sure you explore all your options to find out what's best for you. So check out brochures, course videos, talk to our academics, get in touch with your colleagues even as well and just chat to anyone and everybody, just to make sure that you make the right decision for you. 17:31 My tip would be to just do it. The sooner you do it, the sooner all the benefits of higher education, such as more confidence, greater control of your career, career position, progression, can all be enjoyed. We talked to a lot of people who regret not doing this sooner. So, you can even start some courses in summer if you're interested. 17:49 Well, thank you so much, Rachel and Sam, for your insights today. And thank you for watching this video. Just by taking the few minutes to watch this you're making a big step in making the right decision to help you into the future. So what are your next steps? Check out our course content. We've got videos on just about all of our courses, you can go on to our website, drill right down into individual subject descriptions, everything you need to know is online. Make that decision, and as Rachel said, make an informed decision. If you have questions about our courses, or you need help making that decision, please contact us using the details you can see on the screen here. We also recommend that you register for one of our upcoming events where you can ask more questions and perhaps hear from our students and our academics, about their experiences as well. And finally, just make sure that you apply. Applications are now open for postgraduate students who apply directly with UTS online. It's totally free. It takes about 20 minutes to half an hour to get that done. For undergraduate students, you apply through UAC, and you can see the link on the screen now for that as well. Thank you so much and good luck with your decision making. Rachel - UTS Business School 00:02 Okay, good evening, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us for this evening’s webinar, where we will be going through UTS Business School's Bachelor of Accounting coop scholarship program. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation upon whose ancestral lands our city campus now stands. I would also like to pay respect to the elders both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land. I'm also conscious that as a webinar, we're zooming in from all different areas. So I would also like to extend that acknowledgement to the traditional owners of the land that you're zooming in from as well. Now, before we get started, I'd just like to bring to your attention that this session will be recorded. So we won't be using anyone's names when we do q&a. So there's still anonymity there, but just letting you know that it will be recorded. Oops, just jumping ahead there. So this is a very interactive session, we know that you've probably got a lot of questions. If you do have any, we really strongly encourage you to hit the q&a button just at the bottom of your Zoom taskbar. And we will be responding to certain questions during the session. And we will also be chatting through some of them at the end as well. Now, my name is Rachel and I have the pleasure of working in the student recruitment team at UTS. Joining me this evening is Michelle Cook, who's the director of The Bachelor of Accounting program, as well as Bianca Buckman, who is a partner at PwC, who is one of our fantastic sponsor organizations. We're also joined by first-year BAcc students, Bianca and John, third-year student, Ethan, who's currently completing his second internship, and also Georgia who finished the course last year and is now working as a grad at KPMG. In the background is Carin who works with Michelle on the BAcc program, and she'll be answering any questions that come through during the session. And as I mentioned, we'll also be answering questions at the end of the session two. So any questions that you do see come through, you can upvote them. So you know, if there's a question you don't need to ask again, you can just upvote it. And we will respond to that as well. Being a webinar, I know we're in year three of a lot of virtual events. So you're probably well-versed in troubleshooting. But please bear with us. If there are any technical issues, we'll work to resolve them as quickly as possible. If you find you're not able to access the webinar, at any point, usually the old logging out and logging back in again, excuse me, usually resolves such issues. So tonight, we're going to be presenting on the following topics, what the Bachelor of Accounting actually is, what the core structure is, our sponsors, how the internships work, the career options available, the application process, as well as q&a. So, Michelle, thank you so much for joining us. One of the questions we get asked all the time is, what exactly is the Bachelor of Accounting? How is it different to the Bachelor of Business with a major in accounting? Can you give us a bit of an overview on that? Oh, I think you're on mute Michelle. Michelle Cook 03:46 Oh, my gosh, after all this time zoom ever I think I've learned as the words came, I was on mute. So I do apologize. But I just welcome you to this webinar. And I hope that we can answer some of the questions that you might have about the Bachelor of Accounting programZoom. So how is it different from the Bachelor of Business? Well, I started called back as we call it, a Bachelor of Business on steroids, because we do it so much faster than the normal Bachelor of Business. And within the Bachelor of Accounting program, you are required to do an accounting major. And we'll go more into the structure of those things a little bit later. Nothing that really sets it apart from the Bachelor of Business is that you do get to six-month internships, which is full-time with one of our sponsor organizations. And you also get a scholarship of up to about $56,000 Over the three years. So the other major differentiators about the program and also the tight-knit sort of cohort, because there's usually only about 30 to 35 students in the actual intake itself. It says that sort of answer your question, Rachel. Rachel - UTS Business School 04:54 Absolutely. Brianna, I might also throw to you as well because obviously you were sitting where a lot of our attendees were sitting this time last year. So what did you kind of think accounting was when you were wondering what course to choose and what you thought it was turned out to be the reality. 05:15 Look, before I went through the rabbit hole that was researching BAcc, I thought accounting was, you know, the old number crunching, you know, debits, credits and all that. But I've come into the course it's not that at all. You know, you do so much business. So my subjects right now are so far outside of business as well. There's like economics. There's statistics as this sudden other and it's just so broad and saturated. I don't think I could have imagined what it was before actually joined. Rachel - UTS Business School 05:46 When and Georgia, obviously, you're even further on the other side of things as a graduate. Do you want to add anything to what Brianna said as an alum and from you know, your based on your work experience and internships? Georgia - BAcc Student 06:01 Yeah, I can basically echo what Brianna said, I thought accounting would basically be all numbers number crunching, as mentioned by Brianna, really complex mathematics, and truly be super boring as there's a common perception that accounting is very, very boring, sitting at your desk all day, no social life, as well as the people too. But my experiences have been like the polar opposite. The math is very straightforward. Even if you have a basic do basic math, at scope, I was gonna say University, oh my gosh, I'm way past that now. School are more than capable of completing the BAcc. As well as the people I've met within studying accounting. They're not boring people at all. They're very insightful and passionate, such as my lecture as people out in the workforce when I've undertaken my internships. And that's something I really value and have, like, come to learn. It's an amazing career to have. But all in all, I guess, through studying accounting, through studying back at university, I've learned the importance of accounting in business, which really plays to the fact that accounting is the Language of Business. And yeah, it differentiates you from any other business student, which is amazing. Rachel - UTS Business School 07:17 Excellent. Thank you so much, Georgia. Now, the Bachelor of Accounting is a very competitive course. Michelle, we do expect a lot from our backs. What are you looking for from our current students? Oh, I think you're on mute again, Michelle. Michelle Cook 07:41 I'm sorry, we have new systems. And so my webcams Oh, sorry to everyone. So I've been trying to place it so you can see me properly. So I apologize profusely, but we'll get it right. But we do we look for and expect of our students, we expect them to be nice people. We want them to have curiosity, humility. It's not only about taking a position in this program, it's also understanding the privilege you're given to have a life changing moment, and how do we contribute that back into our society. So part of our mission statement is to create future business leaders using accounting as a foundation. But I sort of add on to that, and also with the humility and respect to give back to society, because that's what we sort of stand for at UTS as well. So we do expect a lot, but we give a lot to in order to develop students in so many ways, so that they can become I suppose the best of themselves and the best person they can be. Rachel - UTS Business School 08:37 Absolutely. Now, Jahn, obviously, you know, you're in first year, you've just come off the back of the HSC. How do you find the workload in the program? 08:50 At the moment, look, the workload is it's pretty good, fast track period, which all the students will go through that is lengthy. We're not lengthy at all. It's actually really brief. But there is a big workload in that. And I think it depends how much you sort of do outside of University. I'm myself, I'm at college where there are a lot of other responsibilities. So I do I often find myself having instances where I got I've got a lot to do right now. But as I always say to people, being busy is not a bad thing. I definitely prefer being busy than being bored. So it's definitely manageable to say have a job. I know Brianna works a job outside of uni at the moment. So let's definitely do one first semester, but you probably wouldn't be able to do in second semester as you already be working a full time job, but it's definitely manageable, I'd say. Rachel - UTS Business School 09:39 Excellent. And Michelle, Jahn just mentioned fast track, which a lot of our viewers might be wondering what exactly is fast track. Michelle Cook 09:50 So we start very early in the year. We have to let you know, we start early to allow you to have that six months period in your first day to do internships. So we come straight from the fireworks of Christmas, straight into the third of January. And we start. And they do a thing as a dimension called Fast Track. So first is we'll do two subjects in six weeks. So and you do it in block moto come to me for nine to five every day. And you do a tutorial and a lecture in one in one day itself. And then, of course, you do the various assessments that go with that. But that will then allows them so much time to do that six month internship. And that's why we actually do fast track. So we do fast track in first year, with two subjects and fast track in second year with one subject in that summer period. Rachel - UTS Business School 10:45 Excellent. And Georgia. How do you find looking back on you know, juggling Fast Track juggling internships juggling some semblance of a social life? Do you feel that that helped prepare you for full time work? Georgia - BAcc Student 11:00 Most definitely, I wouldn't trade it for anything. When you're in the moment, you definitely think it's a bit overwhelming, you have to learn what we call is like we've got buckets, we've got a social bucket, we've got like a study bucket, which is where your education goes into, then you have other buckets as well, you've got to learn how to manage your time and put as much water time into the buckets as you wish. And that definitely translates into the workforce. So as Michelle has mentioned, we get to six month internships where you have to study alongside it simultaneously. I would say this definitely helped prepare me for juggling commitments at KPMG. Because I'm also completing my Chartered Accountants. So that study alongside working exactly the same as what we did in Deac. As well as within beer, we're also encouraged to take place in clubs and societies as well. So not only on top of work, then University, then clubs, then you got clubs and societies, that also takes up another portion of your time. So now I look back on it, I definitely wouldn't trade it for anything. I've been able to prioritize my time coming into KPMG. I feel like I have a lot more time up my sleeves. Maybe it's just because studying is not as intense. But yeah, it's, it's great. Rachel - UTS Business School 12:15 Excellent, fantastic. And I love your analogy about the buckets and ensuring that they're all They're all adequately watered. I think that's great advice for a lot of our attendees who are probably feeling a little under the pump with their HSc year. Now, Michelle, obviously, you spoke a little bit about Fast Track and what that is, but would you be able to talk us through exactly how the course works, Michelle Cook 12:41 So as I said, you have to do a major in accounting. So what does a major mean at uni, it means eight subjects a specific to that. area. So in accounting, you would do caught you do eight subjects, you do come in in your first year, you do a general degree. So you touch on each bit, you do a bit of marketing a bit of economics, as Brianna was saying. And it gives you a wide range of interests that you might want to pursue besides the accounting degree, then you do your accounting majors are saying, which is eight subjects. And then what I love about UTS is the flexibility in the choice of what you do after that, you can either choose to do another major, for example, finance, or you can do that. So that's eight subjects, or you can do to specialist subjects in whatever you choose to do, which is amazing, which is four subjects and four subjects. A lot of students that are in their third year, will choose to do a sub major. So do four subjects. And then they finished the other four electives overseas. So we've had people go to I know in this year to Milan, to the US to Switzerland, and then finish their degree overseas. So there it is very broad in what you couldn't do, and also really broad in how you can develop yourself. Because for me, it's about learning. Like you should really try and explore all the different options that you can to become a really holistic and professional person. So that's sort of how we work our majors and sub majors. And as I said, it runs as per the business degree, but we just do have to do a major in accounting. Rachel - UTS Business School 14:23 Exactly. And I think it's important to note as well that you don't need to have a set idea of what you want to do. So there's a lot of options there. And the beauty is that you do get exposed to those different areas of business. So you could very well go in thinking economics is something I definitely want to specialize in and then you know, you might think oh actually marketing is more appealing or I want to pair finance with accounting. Brianna, which kind of boat were you in? Did you come into the course knowing exactly how you wanted to specialize or have you decided yet or whereabouts are you Look when 15:01 I entered the course, I mean, like, you always have some idea floating around, but I wasn't set on a path. And I'm still not set on our path yet. I'm in my first year. So I have a lot of time to decide that especially looking at this internships and getting to experience those, but currently, I'm leaning more towards funds management, sort of the investment area, I'm really excited to get into the internship just to see how you know, life and annuities goes, but ya know, still not sure you don't have to be sure. Michelle is not going to look at you and go she she doesn't know what she wants to do. We're not going to take you like, yeah, a lot of my friends and I we have no idea exactly what we're doing with the rest of our lives. Rachel - UTS Business School 15:45 Excellent. Excellent. And, Jahn, what about yourself? Do you know what you want to specialize in? 15:52 Um, yes, at the moment. So sort of similar to be honest, do very, keeping my options open, I think that's one of the great things about the program is you get exposed to so many different areas. And that will allow you to keep an open mind, you allow yourself to gain so many experiences. So as Briana sort of touched on, we've got our internships coming up. So that'd probably be a really good experience, we can see things that we like and see what we don't like. And then from that, we can sort of gauge as to where we might like to go. But at the moment, I'm in regards to selecting my second major, I've thought about maybe economics, or doing a sub major with something similar to economics and in any business law, because I just remembered in school in the HSC are, obviously business interests me, but also Legal Studies and Economics where I really enjoyed those. So that might be something I'd like to pursue in the future. But it's definitely good to keep an open mind. And if you already have an open mind, that's great, because you can just sort of gauge things as you go, and then decide where you want to go. And you've got a bit of experience. Rachel - UTS Business School 16:50 Excellent, fantastic. And really great advice as well. Georgia, obviously, you've been through the process, what did you choose to major in or do a sub major in? Georgia - BAcc Student 17:01 Yeah, of course. Um, so basically, as mentioned, we have to do a compulsory major in accounting to start off with so one of my majors was accounting. Then in the second half, I actually did a sub major in finance than I need for elective. So it's presented on the right hand, very right hand side of the screen. I chose a sub major in finance, as I've always been very mathematical. I came into the UK actually wanting to do finance. So yeah, I was set on it from the start. A lot of people aren't, though, as Bianna and John said, You got to keep open minded because you go through experiences that shape what you want to do at university. That yeah, I guess I was slightly different. But it's very, very common to be thinking that way. Um, I found in all the subjects within the accounting major and the finance sub major, to be very hands on and practical, which is what I loved on as you're constantly learning, we're constantly learning about huge corporations are learning how to read financial statements, and ultimately provide me with that experience. And that foundation to venture out into any aspect of the corporate world, which I found really important. Then I guess, to top off my degree, I chose some electives, which are the four little individual slots on the right hand side of the screen, just to diversify my knowledge and to really choose subjects I was interested in, but I couldn't encapsulate in one sub major. So I did subjects ranging from management to it. And I think there are a few marketing subjects in there as well. And every subject was super insightful and very, very relevant in the current world. And I can give a brief example, my it subject, I completed during the time that Optus had their massive data breach, and we were actually like security and data at that time. So yeah, it's, it's great having the flexibility of adding on to sub majors are some major and electives as you can really tailor your degree to suit what you want to pursue and what you want to learn. Rachel - UTS Business School 19:00 Excellent. And I think your point as well about the practicality, you know, you're studying financial statements, you were studying case study in real time with Optus, seeing how they responded, seeing how it happened, like yes, in the real time nature is is very apparent. Now, obviously, uni life goes beyond the classroom and, you know, the social component of uni generally, it's really important. Michelle, there's a lot of talk about the BAcc family. I think you might have actually mentioned that earlier as well. And how valuable is that for our students? Can you talk a little bit about the close knit nature of the course. Michelle Cook 19:45 Absolutely. I don't think people really believe me and I think Brianna and the other banks on the call will agree with me say you will your edge mates and the closest friends you've ever had. And and you really do but I think The beauty of it is that we do lots of things, we really try and look after each other. So we have, we've got your back to mentoring program. So we're people are mentored from the year above them. And you're above that. And so we have mentoring trees. And usually we get together once a session with each other, I think, I think the first year, we've had dinners and all sorts of things, and coffee cat jobs with their buddy. And we try and expand that right to the alumni. So that once a year, we get all get together in that tree. So we can try and help each other. And I think that's a really important part of the fabric of back is that we do look after each other. And there's nothing that you need to worry about, because you'll have so much support going through the program. And I think there's the BI Bowl coming up. On next Saturday, I think everyone's very stressed about what they're going to wear. And there's not only they don't only work hard and support each other in that, there's also a fantastic social element. And I think it's really been accentuated because we all found out what it's like not to be connected during COVID. So it's a real hunger, I think, for people to connect with each other, and have all those different as aspects of getting to know one another and have a supportive environment. Rachel - UTS Business School 21:28 Absolutely. Jahn, now, I believe that you're actually from Orange, is that correct? Um, yeah, 21:35 I am. So I had moved to Sydney in fast track. But um, yeah, so did you have like a follow up on that? Perfect. Rachel - UTS Business School 21:44 No, I did. So you know, obviously, did you know anyone, you know, coming into the course, I mean, because you obviously didn't just have a new course and a new university environment, you had a completely new city as well. 21:58 Yeah. So um, fortunately, I have like a lot of family in Sydney, and my brother lived in Sydney. So I moved to one of the Sydney Uni colleges. So they were really great. But, um, it was somewhat of a daunting experience. At first, I knew no one that was in the cohort. I did know some other people that have done the program. That's actually how I heard about it. But within my ego, I didn't know anyone but um, it's quite a daunting experience going on the first day sort of going in, but um, as Michelle and everyone's talked about this, they have family and having great friendships, the any of the like, berries or whatever, everything was broken instantly. And as first year students, you have your first orientation day, then you go into camp, on a farm out near Mittagong through the barrel area. And that is just the biggest icebreaker in itself. That's where a lot of the friendships are made. And it's just a great experience. And then from then on, after the camp, you start the Fast Track period, which is obviously academic stuff, it's really nice to have that period of just getting to know each other. So I'd say yeah, for me, the whole move itself, it's honestly been a breeze, making friends has been a breeze. And it's just been a great time so far. Yeah. Rachel - UTS Business School 23:08 Excellent, fantastic. And Brianna, sometimes we hear that in your 12. You know, obviously, you've got your friendships, you've gone through high school with them. But sometimes it can be quite competitive people keen to get first in advanced English or whatever. Whereas at university, and especially in the Bachelor of Accounting, everyone's quite collegial. Do you find that there's a lot of assistance in the program? You can bounce ideas off each other? 23:38 Yeah, look, it's definitely a lot different from high school. Even in high school, I wasn't very stingy about sharing my notes. But here, it's a whole new level like you wouldn't believe, to a point where like, we might get a bit of disapproval for it. Because we will sit next to each other and do quizzes together, weekly quizzes that come out every Tuesday, there are three of them. And we all just sit together and do them. There's no sort of competition between who will do the best. I mean, there's friendly competition, you know, there's a little bit going on about between two of our BX about who's going to do better, but it's all friendly competition, none of us are gonna go back and give you the wrong answers or stab each other in the backs because we want to do better. It's all very uplifting environment, you're always gonna get help. So for us, we have this big, big group chat with all three of 36 of us. And you can send questions in there any point in the day and someone will help you out. And it's just a very, very welcoming, welcoming environment that just allows you to do really well academically as well. Rachel - UTS Business School 24:44 Excellent, fantastic. And Georgia you mentioned clubs and societies as well. Do you want to chat to us a little bit about some of the clubs and societies you were part of and, and also as an alum, like, do you still keep in touch with A lot of your back cohort. So a bit of a two fold question for you. Yeah, Georgia - BAcc Student 25:05 I'll read the former first. So um, some clubs and societies I was involved in is women in business or they're amazing at like empowering females towards leadership opportunities. And anything in the corporate environment, it's a great space. I was also highly involved, there's probably one extra one that I would say I was most involved in, which was case team case team is a massive thing, especially with BX on there are a lot of bx tend to be involved in case 10, there's an opportunity to travel overseas with the funded by the university, and it's basically a competition where it's a competition, and companies provide a stimulus, and you have to try and solve real life business problems for them. In a short period of time, some of them, you may only have three hours to find the solution for the problem. Some of them can be six hours, some of them could be 24 hours, it completely depends. But that's an amazing, I guess, you'd say it's both a club and a society, because you get to travel with it. Um, but yeah, highly recommend engaging yourself in case team or any other even any other club or society, you're more than welcome to join, and everyone will take you in. And there's such great opportunities. There are also cultural societies, you can join through clubs, dog society, cat society, on the range is so diverse, and it's tailored to every single person. Next part of the question, do I maintain social connections? Yes, I definitely did. And our cohort definitely did. So Brianna mentioned their cohort was is 36 students, we only had 27 in our cohort. So we were very, very closely knit and has still remained in contact, whether I'm texting them, whether we're creating social events together, or even run into them in the city. And that connection never gets lost, which I think is an amazing benefit of the B app program. The fact that the connections don't just exist at university, that beyond University too. And just to add one small thing is that it's not only within your cohort, either, you become really close to the cohorts above the cohorts below you, which I think is also really important, because like I said, I run into people in the city, I'm not just running into people in my cohort, you're running into people who are two years above you or two years below, and you can see them really develop. And it's it's amazing to see. Rachel - UTS Business School 27:27 Excellent, fantastic, thank you for sharing your experience as well. Now, obviously, we wouldn't have the Bachelor of Accounting if it weren't for our sponsors. Now, obviously, a huge part of the way that the sponsors are involved is throughout internships, and we'll be speaking about those in just a little while. But Michelle, how else do our students network with our sponsors? Michelle Cook 27:59 We have so many events that we can form a relationship with both the students and also the sponsors. And the sponsors are just so generous in giving their time. And also trying to develop the next, I suppose future leaders and developing young talent. And so we do things like the first year guest lectures. Amazing. So students will be out of school, high school for a matter of months. And they'll be meeting partners like Bianca from PWC. They'll be meeting CEOs CFOs of some of these companies, which are actually some of the biggest companies in Australia, if not the world. So those are some of the things we also have events where they'll come and students get the opportunity to network right across the board and develop really good skills on relationship building. With the sponsors, we have create career expos, which is only for vx and the sponsors. So a multitude of events where students really get to be, I suppose, in the face of the C suite, which is unknown at a university in the university, even some people in industry or would not have those opportunities. So we are very, very lucky with the generosity as I was saying all have our sponsors and the time they give to develop our fantastic bx. Rachel - UTS Business School 29:16 Well, speaking of the generosity of the time of our sponsors, it's a great segue to throw to Bianca PwC has been such a great supporter of the program, and has been a sponsor for so many years now. What was it that made PwC decide to come on board as a sponsor. 29:39 Thanks, Rachel. And good evening, everyone. As Rachel said, I'm Bianca Buckman a partner at PwC in our Sydney office, working in our financial services assurance team. And you can see here I have my accounting CA certificate in the background as well. So a very great qualification that that I encourage you all to Do, Rachel To be honest, I actually don't know what year we became a sponsor. But it was well before I was involved, so I can't speak for back then. But I can speak for now as to why we continue to sponsor the program. That, I guess the way I think about it is, the quality of the students that come out of this program is in a league of its own, it's exceptional. I have seen a number of our interns and then people who come and come and work with us at as a graduate afterwards, and the quality and like their, their way they think they're very well rounded individuals. They've got the accounting qualification qualification in terms of their major, they've got work experience with them. They just stand out when we're going through graduate programs. So essentially, I've probably seen the majority that come through to PwC. As graduates, they ended up being our top rated performers for the time that they are with the firm. So I did, we just actually had one UTS Co Op alumni become a partner this year. So that was pretty exciting. And I've seen a number of them do other things with their careers as well, which is fantastic. But to me, it's the part of what I love is that Michelle and the team go through such a rigorous process. And it's so competitive in terms of who they accept into the program, that they've done all the hard work for me as a sponsor. So I know that anyone who's in this program is going to be an exceptionally high quality candidate to come into the firm as a graduate. And I love being able to, to know that and rely on that year after a year. Rachel - UTS Business School 32:07 Excellent, fantastic. And yeah, just knowing that you can bank on it is, as you say, a real relief, 32:13 you feel like a lot of the hard work is done for you. Exactly. Rachel - UTS Business School 32:18 So when we talk about internships, because obviously it's such a huge part of the program, both in terms of time experience, and and for the graduates as well actually coming out with that year. But sometimes we find that the word internship conjures images of photocopying, and making coffee and you know, going and fetching, you know, dry cleaning and things like that, which you know, isn't exactly the case. Bianca, would you be able to talk us through some of the kinds of kinds of work that our interns do do at PWC? 32:53 Yeah, absolutely. So when any of your students come and intern with us, we actually treat them, they start with a graduate and trainee cohort that all start at the same time. And frankly, they get treated exactly the same. So they come in, they're not treated like an intern, most people don't even realize that they're an intern, they'll just think they're one of the grads, or trainees starting with us at that time. So when they joined, they will have two weeks of pretty intense training with us to learn the basics around auditing and audit methodology. And then they'll be pretty much straight on client engagements. So straight out with the team, looking after particular areas of the audit. And so looking at, I guess what we sort of think is our foundation level areas of auditing parts of the financial statements of companies. And so they'll be on the job with their teams being coached by their team members to learn and understand how to do the work that they need to do. And then we'll be doing that, that involves talking directly with the client building relationships with the client, learning the technical aspects of audit methodology, learning about audit quality, how to document their work, so I definitely don't send my juniors on coffee runs. So that that doesn't happen. I don't think sometimes they might volunteer, but we all take turns. But it's really you get thrown straight into the thick of the the engagement work that that we all do. So it's some, it can sometimes be a little bit full on and probably overwhelming at the beginning. But you you see them from sort of day one through to six months. And it's amazing watching the journey they go on in terms of how capable they are by the end of the six months and how much they've really learned that's allowed them to put the things that they've been learning at university into practice on a day to day perspective, which is a huge plus for them when they're going out into the world to become a graduate, whether it's with PwC, another sponsor or elsewhere, they already have a year experience working in an accounting field under their belt, which again, sets them apart from the competition as they're working through graduate program recruit recruitment programs. Rachel - UTS Business School 35:25 Excellent, fantastic. And Georgia, obviously, as we've said, you're on the other side of things as a as an alumni now, how did you find the internship process? Especially how, you know, how did you find the tasks different in first year versus in third year? Georgia - BAcc Student 35:44 Yeah, I guess the process in general, just to make it clear, Michelle is very, very good at considering your preferences to where you want to be placed, but also knowing that organization that you'd fit best in. So that also plays Michelle strengths, she has done it for a very, very long time. She knows if you may put in a preference to where you want to get placed, and you may not get your preference. But guess what every single company that sponsors the program, as incredible from start to finish, and you have an amazing experience, based off my experiences, so my first internship was at Coca Cola Amatil, which is now Coco, your Pacific partners, oh, my gosh, that was four years ago, I have to retrace my memory. I was in a finance roles are chief reporting to the Chief Financial Controller. So I was doing accounting work, budgets, on what else SAP everything from that aspect, which is completely different to my second internship, which was with Bianca PWC. I was in order at PWC. So working on the complete opposite side of the accounting aspects rather than producing the numbers. This time, I was trying to verify the numbers. Yeah, which was actually a great experience, I really enjoyed the audit side of things, because I had to be analytical had to really search awareness states could pop up, had to understand the process from start to finish, it wasn't just looking at the financial statements being like, Hmm, that number seems large, let me investigate that, or that number is too small, I'm not going to investigate that. There's more of a procedure to that, which is what I really enjoy. And I'm doing audit at KPMG. Now, which is very, very similar to PwC. And it's definitely where I want to be audit is where I want to be. Yeah, I loved accounting, but I think what it stretches me that tiny bit more, which is something I've always looked for and want to push those boundaries. So yeah, they're incredible. Like I said, I'm not going to point out any sponsors, because they're all incredible. And any single company that you go to, you're going to have an amazing experience with. Rachel - UTS Business School 37:58 Excellent, thank you so much, Bianca. And, again, I just want to touch on as well, the fact that you mentioned that Michelle, actually tailors, you know, takes preferences into account, but also tailors your strengths and skills. So, Michelle, again, that's just evidence of how closely you do work with our students. You know, can you give us a couple of examples of, you know, how you how you're able to match them up, and you know, what you kind of look for? Michelle Cook 38:25 Yes, I will, people are different developmental stages in their lives. And we have to be very aware of that, we have to look at how we can develop them, but also make sure they have a great experience in the corporate world. So when I was sitting in, I was thinking about, thank you very much for the kind words, Georgia that I was thinking about, Oh my gosh, imagine I'm sitting there about to do my HSC. And oh, my gosh, I'll go into a six month internship. The world is actually a very commonplace, and we know how we develop your skills, you're never thrown into the deep end, you always have someone that will help you. And we just try and mimic that. So there are times when you will talk to me, you might you might know what all these companies do. But hopefully I do. I always say the backs you don't know what you don't know, that always open your mind to embracing so many different things. So we do get to know you quite well. Because we see each other a lot. And then we talk about you where you'd like to go where where you where we maybe can develop skills, where that skills in confidence, skills in people management, you know, the whole gamut of the professional world, that and I suppose attributes that we really like to say, and then we try and match that with companies. So some people will be better maybe in the first entrance at a smaller company. Others will be better at a bigger company. It's oh so many So many variables, it's amazing. But it really does all work out. And I think, from the internships you get, get a greater sense of self. And I love when you come to me after those six months, just your growth is just phenomenal, then that just an amazing sort of experience it I think, that is quite unique to back, then we track your growth. And really, we never let you go. So there's no such thing as a back alumni. So Georgia, you're always just to be Rachel - UTS Business School 40:34 fantastic. And just circling back to our sponsors, specifically PWC. I've, I've just been messaged by the lovely Kern who said that PwC have actually been a supporter since 1995. 40:49 Wow. 20 Rachel - UTS Business School 40:51 years. So obviously, well before your time. But again, that's really, really testament to the relationship that PwC has with UTS. And, and I know speaking on behalf of UTS, we are incredibly grateful for all of the experience and all of the support that we've had over those 28. Fantastic. 41:15 It's been a pleasure, we love getting the students. So it's, we always get excited when we have some coming through as graduates. So it's fabulous. Michelle Cook 41:26 And just to mention, too, that at the moment, Biak the Co Op program has the most sponsors in accounting, any company of any co op in Australia, which we're also very, very proud of. Rachel - UTS Business School 41:42 Absolutely. Hence why this year has been a bigger cohort than traditional year. So I know that we've had a question come through that said, for 2024, would we be looking for approximately 30? Students? Michelle, do you want to answer that one? Michelle Cook 41:59 Um, you know, I will? I won't know. I hate to make commitments like that, because you're not sure. But I would hope that, you know, we would be able to maintain the level we have and maybe go a little bit further. Rachel - UTS Business School 42:13 Excellent, fantastic. I'm sorry. Now, we've mentioned that, you know, the course can be diversified depending on your interest. We've mentioned that when you graduate with a Bachelor of Accounting, that doesn't mean that you're going to be changed to a calculator and a bean counter or anything like that. Michelle, what kind of roles can graduates expect to work in? Michelle Cook 42:41 Well, you know, we have a BAcc only LinkedIn page. And it's just amazing. The diversity of careers that you could explore through accounting is absolutely incredible. One of our alumni who's just finished in the role, but he was the CFO, Paramount Pictures in Los Angeles. And I love that, you know, when you watch the movies next time, everyone just have a little look, because he will say credits to accountants. Don't you love that? I love that. I do. I do. Yeah. And every every single organization that you can think of needs accountants, and quite desperately, and I'm sure Bianca will elaborate on that in a moment. But I look at accounting as Swiss, we always call it the Language of Business. But it's actually the Swiss Army knife of industry. Because, you know, there's a Swiss Army knives and all the different components of it as a component for every single business. And you can go from accounting into every other sector, whether that be marketing, etc. But you can't come the other way. Absolutely. And what we're finding more and more is that the skills that all our alumni say that they use every day, no matter what role they eventually take, is accounting skills. That's why That's why they're the CFOs the CEOs, because everyone has to know how money goes in and money comes out. It's such an important language and essential for, I suppose, the continuous running of a nation. Rachel - UTS Business School 44:09 Absolutely, yeah. Absolutely. And so, you Michelle Cook 44:12 know, so if so, it'll be interesting, you know, go on to places like LinkedIn, search accountants, and see what they actually do. It's quite amazing. What do you think, Bianca? 44:25 I completely agree, Michelle. So I actually think of people with accounting degrees as well rounded business people. So you know, I'm an audit partner at PWC. But when people say to me, what do you do? I say, you know, I work with clients to give society trust in their results in financial statements. I help them solve problems, and I work with them on whatever is priority for them. The number of my clients I regularly deal with see suite across ASX 50, through to much smaller clients, the majority of C suite clients have their ca qualifications in terms of their Chartered Accountants. And so to me, it's a ticket to being a well rounded business person, whatever you decide to do. And I think that's the really big selling point around doing an accounting degree and something like BIAC, where you combine that with practical experience. Rachel - UTS Business School 45:34 Excellent, fantastic. Thanks, Bianca. Um, now, obviously, we've spoken a lot about what the Course entails what it's like from, you know, our current students, prospective sponsors, alumni, but for our, you know, people currently tuning in a lot of them are year 12. Michel, how do they actually apply for the course? What are you looking for? Michelle Cook 45:59 Yeah. So how you apply first of all, as you put an online application in, but and the first round is 19th of May. And people say, Why do you have a first round and a second round. And really, some people are going to do a few things maybe before the October close date, which is the 13th of October, and they might want to have that on their CV. But what I say is if your CV and current current and I say if your CV is ready, and you put it in now, because you'll get it before you have the pressures of the HSE. From them, it gets cold. So I look for problem solving, leadership, volunteering experience, we weren't all around people. We're not just looking for, you know, the person who gets the highest scores, but can't speak to someone. Because when we just take a step backwards, when you look at what professional skills you need, it's things like communication, curiosity, problem solving. What is what are your What are your other interests, because we're not just an island of HSC? Thank heavens, we are more than that. And that's what we're looking for. We're looking for great all around people. And I always say, even in the interviews, when you get to interview, and I hope you do, I say I just look for nice people. Just nice people, don't worry about the ATAR. Don't worry, it's not about that. It's about who you are as a human and what you can contribute back to the program, and be what are one of our ambassadors really, because that's what you are beauty is when you go into all the different things you do. So from that period, we go into an interview interviews are from them, I always have to look at the you know, the old age brain, make sure about the right dates from the sixth or the 10th to November, you book him for a session, and then we give you yummy, yummy food. So very important. And you have a group assessment. So that means you have a group of four, we give you a problem to work on together. And we look at how you collaborate, how you work within the team. And then after that, you just go into a brief. And I'm not going to call it an interview, I'm going to call it a conversation. It's a conversation with some people about what you've done, what you're proud of. And where do you see yourself going. And from there, we then go into you might be shortlisted and hopefully get a call from me, after eight hours are released to offer you a position in the program, which is one of my happiest days. Rachel - UTS Business School 48:38 Absolutely. I have seen you on off a day it is one of your favorite days. So again, just we've had a question come through about how to prepare for the interview. But Michelle, I think you answered it, be yourself have that authenticity. Michelle Cook 48:55 Yeah. Absolutely. And, you know, never be scared of an opportunity. So be Act is an opportunity. But I always say to everyone who applies is a really big secret i i learned learned a long time ago, and that's no doesn't hurt. But if you don't give yourself the opportunity to get the chance, then that's when you're letting yourself down. So, you know, apply, try and come to the interviews I say and I think I've said that for a few years now. But it's like wanting to win lotto and not getting a ticket. Yes, like it did you use them again. It's never gonna happen. So apply, see where they get you. And I promise you if you connect with some BX or any BX all of them will say I never ever thought I'd get in. And there they are now having a life changing and very empowering experience because they put their hand up and gave themselves a chance. So put your applications in. I sound like wearing There's commercials for knives or something. I really am very passionate about the program. And I'd love to see you also have the chance to be part of it. Rachel - UTS Business School 50:08 Excellent. Thanks for showing fantastic advice as well. We've had a question come in about when it comes to your 12 HSC reports. Do we have a mandatory rank? And no, not the case at all? Now we're having a, as I said, we've got a little bit of time for questions as well. We've had some that come through. We'll give attendees a couple of minutes while they're getting this questions in. I'm going to throw to Georgia, Brianna. And then John in that order. As I said, you're on the other side of the HSA, obviously, with the benefit of your experience so far, what advice would you give your HSA self? Georgia - BAcc Student 50:56 Oh, this is difficult. Um, I think, in general, echoing what Michelle said that every opportunity you don't take is a missed opportunity. If you don't apply for the app, guess what you're not gonna get in because you haven't applied. It's as simple as that. So just apply even if you're a bit unsure as to what you want to do. If you don't apply, you're gonna miss out. And it's an incredible opportunity, incredible experience. And it's an amazing program that I would recommend every single person if I could, who wants to take business? Who wants to do accounting, everything like that? Just just apply? That's all I'd say. Justify. Rachel - UTS Business School 51:35 Excellent, Briana. 51:40 I'm gonna go with two actually. I have. The first one is I like to go into things with the mindset of what's the worst that can happen within reason. Within reason, obviously, you know, when I was applying for this course, I thought, Oh, look, it's a really, really competitive course. What are the chances I get in but I thought, you know, what's the worst that can happen? They can say no, and I can be on my way. But yeah, like George just said, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take so, you know, go into it thinking what's the worst that can happen? If the worst thing can happen is someone saying no to you, I really don't think it's that bad. Just have big crack at it. And the other thing is, if you do something, put 100% of your effort in. And so if you're going to do it fully commit, so whether or not you get into B Act, the course itself, put 100% of effort into whatever you're doing. If you're doing the HSC if you're there while you're there, put 100% of your energy in and once you walk out, it's over. It's done. But yeah, you don't want to have a walk out of somewhere thinking, Oh, maybe I could have put in a little bit more effort. You don't want to look back with that sort of regret. Rachel - UTS Business School 52:44 Excellent. Again, great advice. John, it's always hard going last. You got any other advice that you'd like to add? 52:53 No worries, probably the only thing I could say is sort of, as everyone's mentioned, there is no harm in a bind. The worst scenario sort of Briana said, the worst case scenario is you don't get in and you've written a great CV, you've written an application, and you've just had an interview experience that is both individual and networking sort of component and start when you meet people, and then group activities. And then presenting your idea, your resolution to the question. And then an individual interview, which mom was a chairman, we talked about dual labor for 10 minutes of all things. But yeah, the worst that can happen is you write a great CV, you have an interview experience, and you've just gained two great things, but just apply. So as HSC students, I know you've got a lot going on. I know I got on the application process early. As I thought, Look, I'm already tight for time. Now imagine how top of time I'm going to be in the future as we get close to exams. So I would recommend students to get on it now, as opposed to later I think it's, I always just felt more comfortable when I have gone through, I've got my internship secured, I can, sorry, not my internship at an interview secured, I can put that to his side for now and think about my studies. And we'll get to that later. So there is no problem in applying. It'll take a few hours to write a good reference or whatever good application. But yeah, so many benefits of just applying in itself. And by the chance you get in life changing experience. That's Rachel - UTS Business School 54:19 excellent, great advice. Thank you, John. will now be answering some of your questions. I know Karen has been furiously answering. So to give her fingers a little bit of a break. We'll answer some of them live. Now this is a really common one. Say someone submitted their application, the cutoff date comes and goes. Michelle, how soon do they usually find out whether they've been successful in securing an interview or not? Michelle Cook 54:45 In a week? Week? Fantastic. So closures that brighter than 90 the following Friday, they'll know whether they've secured an interview. Rachel - UTS Business School 54:53 Excellent, fantastic. Yes, exactly. Now, we've had another question come through that says, and again, I'm loving it because it's chronologically. So say they do make it to the interview stage. How long is the interview? Michelle Cook 55:09 Oh, well, it's about 40 minutes in, in the lab doing the group assessment, because we tried to get to know each other first time relax a little bit. And then they have time to solve the problem and present their solution, as John was saying, then they will have an interview. And that's roughly about 20 to 25 minutes per interview. Rachel - UTS Business School 55:34 Excellent, fantastic. Now, if someone applies for round one, but is unsuccessful, can they apply again for round two? Michelle Cook 55:46 I've forgotten is that dual? Applying for round one and then trying again, for round two. We don't generally allow that selection criteria remains. But the selection criteria alignment remains the same. And yeah, yeah. So they said that's. So that's why I'm saying if you think you are going to do a bit more for your CV, then maybe apply and happening by the 13th of October. Rachel - UTS Business School 56:18 Excellent. And someone is also asked, What do we need to submit for the second round of applications? It's exactly the same as the first round of application. Yes. Michelle Cook 56:25 The only reason we had that is it's terrible wording. I know, and I'm so sorry, we've been trying to find a better way to sort of explain it. So first round, is, in the past, there used to be a lot of Cadet ships. And there's they're still Cadet ships now. But at least it gives students the option of knowing that they might have an interview, and they can let the cadetship organization organizations No. And then the second round, of course, is only for those people who have not yet applied and want more time to write their application. Rachel - UTS Business School 57:00 Excellent, fantastic. So again, do we if we apply in October instead of May, are we at a disadvantage? Absolutely not. Briana, did you apply in round one or round two? 57:16 I believe that I did round one look my memories a bit off. But I was pretty set on trying to get it in as early as I could. So I think it was round one. But to be totally honest, it's not something that gets taken into consideration. They're not going to judge you. Like I've not heard Michelle, tell anyone all you around to obviously what happens at it. Why are you hesitating? But no. Round One, round two doesn't really matter which one, it's just mainly out of consideration for you and your time, especially with HSE being in the later months of the year. Rachel - UTS Business School 57:56 Absolutely. I mean, we have to application rounds, genuinely for a reason one of them isn't like a trick or a way of trying to test motivation or anything, they are legitimately exactly the same in terms of intake as well. Now, one question that is a really, really good one. How does the actual scholarship component of the coursework, Michelle, in terms of how is the funding broken up? And how is that allocated? Michelle Cook 58:27 So students will receive that scholarship every fortnight on a Wednesday 10am I just thought I'd let you know about that, because people get excited about that. And that is a tax free scholarship that will come straight to the students. So it goes to the bank account, your own bank account, students asked me, you know, how can they use that money, they can use it in any way they prefer. So it doesn't necessarily have to go to a fee paying, etc, etc. It depends on what they need would need to use that money for. So it's every fortnight or Wednesday at 10am and that gets paid from UTS straight into the successful candidates a bank account. Rachel - UTS Business School 59:20 Excellent, fantastic. Now, I think some of the questions again, Karan in the background has been as soon as the question comes in Karan has been fantastically answering them. Michelle Cook 59:36 Here the backgrounds. Amazing. Rachel - UTS Business School 59:41 Again, a question about when you find out about the interview after week after applications close. How many applicants do you select for the interview process? Michelle Cook 59:51 It's all on the same dates of Yes. So there's no set number. So if you know Everyone has the opportunity to get an interview then that and the caliber of the CV is correct. And they're getting interviewed. Rachel - UTS Business School 1:00:09 Excellent. Okay, fantastic. So we've actually reached the end of our session. Thank you again so much to our panel, to Georgia to Brianna, to John for sharing their experiences. Huge, huge thank you for Bianca, for giving up your time. And as I said, for all the wonderful support that PwC has given the program for 28 years, that still blows my mind, it's older than almost all of our students that are currently enrolled. A friendly reminder to everyone again, that applications for round one close on Friday, the 19th of May, again, just to reiterate, you will not be disadvantaged. If you want to sit out this round and wait until October. That's totally fine. If you've got any questions, please get in touch with us coop.ed@uts.edu.au. That will come through to the lovely Karen. If you wanted to visit us and chat in person, we will be holding our UTS open day on Saturday, the 26th of August, you'll be able to chat to Michel, our current students, and also some of our academics and students from other business disciplines if you're interested in those as well. Again, thank you so much. Have a lovely evening. We hope you found the session useful. Thanks so much. Michelle Cook 1:01:32 Thank you so much, Rachel. Thank you everyone for joining. Dr Anurag Hingorani Hello, everyone, welcome to the Bachelor of Business Information Session. My name is Dr. Anurag Hingorani. And I'm the Bachelor of Business course director. Dr Anurag Hingorani So what is the Bachelor of Business? It is what we call a Bachelor of Commerce. But we have not used the term commerce, perhaps to acknowledge that there is more to business than just commerce, the exchange of goods and services, we have also retained the name Bachelor of Business, because you don't own a commerce, you own a business. The Bachelor of Business course, is a very flexible course. And you'll see how flexible it is. When I talk to you about the different ways in which you can structure the Bachelor of Business course. It is also a professionally focused degree. And I'll also talk about that a little later. Dr Anurag Hingorani So why should you study business at UTS? As mentioned, it is a practical course and you will gain real world practical skills when you complete various subjects and assignments. We bring industry into the classroom. Industry oftentimes provides real world projects, which students can create as part of their coursework. We also have guest speakers from industry. So it's not just about business theory, but it's also about business practice, and you gain exposure to that in a variety of ways. You also use a variety of business tools to complete different assessments. Why should you study business at UTS? Another reason is, we want our graduates to become socially conscious business leaders. As you know, businesses are in business, to be accountable to customers to shareholders, but we also want businesses to be accountable to the public at large, it is no longer business as usual, businesses should not be concerned just about profit or customers or shareholders, they also need to be concerned with society at large. And we in fact, have a specific subject dedicated to this topic. Dr Anurag Hingorani As mentioned, this is a practical course, we are industry connected. And as you might already know, we are located where industry is located. So that provides opportunities for connections with industry. Perhaps when you complete a business internship as part of your course, we also bring to the classroom industry speakers, guest speakers from industry, who impart their knowledge and contemporary knowledge to students. Now, business internships is an elective subject or an option that students can complete. They are available in almost all majors. And you can also do it as part of an elective. So it's like a win win, you're getting internship experience, but you're also getting course credit for a business internship that you've undertaken. Dr Anurag Hingorani So in the business course, we cover every field of business - Accounting, Economics, Finance, Management, and Marketing. And we also look at some related fields in business as well, such as Human Resource Management, International Business, Advertising, and Marketing Communications. The Bachelor of Business course, as I've said before is very flexible. And the flexibility is derived from the different ways in which you can structure the Bachelor of Business course. Dr Anurag Hingorani There are six different ways in which you can structure your Bachelor of Business course. And that also gives you choice; gives you variety. Of course, in the first year, all students do a set of eight core subjects. So you do not have to make any decisions about structuring your course in the first year, because that decision is made for you. All students do the same set of eight core subjects. Dr Anurag Hingorani So what are the eight core subjects that all students do in their very first year? They range from Accounting to Economics, Finance, Management, Marketing, Statistics, and we have recently reviewed the Bachelor of Business course and have introduced a subject called Business and Social Impact. As mentioned before, we want students to be socially responsible leader, you want our graduates to become socially aware. And in the subject Business and Social Impact, students learn how businesses contribute to the public good society at large. In some of our other subjects, we of course, look at traditional business fundamentals. So for example, in marketing, we look at the four P's of marketing, of course, but students also get an appreciation for the different viewpoints or different considerations of a customer. So you might be familiar with the four P's of marketing, but you will be looking at the four C's as well, when you take up the subject marketing and customer value. So for example, let's say a restaurant owner sets a price for a menu item like lasagne, that is the price component of the four piece of the marketing mix. But let's say the consumer is ordering that online and wants it delivered. So it's not just the price of the lasagne, which would be a consideration for the consumer, it would also be the cost it takes to deliver that lasange to them, also the cost it takes them or the time it takes them to enter their order details, for example. So it's not just about price. It's also the cost from the consumers perspective. Dr Anurag Hingorani In the subject, People and Organizations, students look at leadership from different perspectives. They look at leadership in terms of how they can navigate within an organization, right from the get go as they commence their career journey. In Accounting, you look at accounting from multiple perspectives as as well from an outsider looking in as well as an insider perspective. So as mentioned, in the first year, all students will be completing the same set of eight core subjects. So you do not have to make any decision about how you should go about structuring the rest of your Bachelor of Business course. Dr Anurag Hingorani So in the second and third year, you will be commencing a Major. So in the first year, everyone does the same set of eight core subjects, but from the second year you will come in as a major. And then depending on which structure you end up choosing, you might also be completing some majors. Now, as you can see in the slide, there are a range of majors you can choose from, you have the usual majors of Accounting, Economics, Finance, Management, Marketing, but you also can choose Human Resource Management, International Business, Advertising and Marketing communications. In terms of sub majors, you can see the large number of sub niches that are on offer, there's 30, plus sub majors that you can choose from. So I've said that the Bachelor of Business course is very flexible, because there are six different ways in which you can tailor your decree, I'll be going through each option, one by one, there are six different ways. Dr Anurag Hingorani So the first way is where you add a second major. Now, I said that in the first year, all students will be doing the same set of eight core subjects. So you're not making any decision about your BBus structure, the rest of your BBus structure, that decision is made for you in the first year. So no worries, right, you don't have to make a decision. But commencing from the second year, you have to decide on a major. And I've talked about the fact that you can choose from eight different majors. But then for the rest of the course, in option one, you might decide apart from one major, you want to do another major, a second major. So this is option one, where you do a second major. And for a second major, you can choose any of the business majors I mentioned previously. Or you could also choose Business Law or IT has a second major. You cannot do Business Law or IT as your first major but you can choose it as a second major. Let me give you an example. Let's say you've done the core. Then you choose Marketing as your first major. And with this structure, you decide on Finance as your second major. So as far as you're concerned, you're doing a Marketing major and a Finance major. In a sense, this is like getting two degrees in what it isn't, of course, you're just getting that one Bachelor of Business course and one Bachelor of Business degree. But in a sense, by doing two majors, you're specializing in two different fields. And it's almost like getting two degrees in one. But it's not two degrees, it's just one degree. So this is an option for students who know what they want to specialize in. And they know that they're interested in marketing and finance. And upon graduation, they might just look for marketing related jobs, because they've majored in marketing. Or they might just look for finance related jobs because they majored in finance. Or they might try to marry the two and perhaps take a marketing role in say, a finance financial institution, like a bank, a superannuation fund, insurance provider, etc. So this is one way of structuring your Bachelor of Business course, where you choose to major so you decide to do a second major. Dr Anurag Hingorani This is another way of structuring your Bachelor of Business course, with option two, you're not doing a second major, but you're choosing two sub-majors. A sub-major is four subjects, a major is eight subjects. So in this example, you're all doing the first year, then you've chosen a first major. But instead of doing a second major, you're doing two sub-majors. In other universities, you might hear a sub-major being called a minor. So that's what this is. It's not a major, it's a minor, but we call it sub-majors. So you're doing two sub-majors. So using the example of marketing major as your first major, in this scenario, you do marketing is your first major, you might choose Accounting sub-major as one of your sub-majors, and maybe Management as a sub-major. So you're not doing a second major, but you're doing two sub-majors with this option. Dr Anurag Hingorani With this option, option three, you're not doing two sub-majors, instead, you're doing one sub-major, and four free or unspecified electives. So using the marketing, major example, you've chosen marketing is your first major, then you might do accounting as a sub-major, and then you do four free or unspecified electives. They are not free in terms of finances or money. But it's an unspecified elective. That's what we mean by free elective. So with the four electives, you might choose one subject from economics, one subject from human resource management, one subject from faculty, perhaps another elective could be from another faculty. So you're mixing and matching different things when you're choosing your electives in this structure. So this structure is one way, you're not doing a second major, you're not doing two sub-majors, you're only doing one sub-major plus four free, or unspecified electives. Dr Anurag Hingorani This next option, option four is a new option that we introduced in 2022. In this option, you're not doing a second major, you're not doing two sub-majors. You're not doing one sub-major and four free elevtives. Instead, you're doing eight free or unspecified electives. So using the marketing major example, so you've chosen marketing as your first major, and then you're picking and choosing subjects electives from different areas of business. It could also be from different areas in the university from different faculties. Of course, when you choose these free or unspecified electives, you've got to make sure you meet the entry requirements for a particular subject. Subjects typically have entry requirements, which we call prerequisites. So even though you can do eight free or unspecified electives, whichever letters you're interested in whichever faculty you're interested in, you've got to make sure that you meet the entry requirements for a subject. So just to illustrate this further, so you decide on marketing is your first major, then you might do one elective from accounting, one from economics, one from finance, one from management, one from it, one from science, one from nursing, if that strikes your fancy. So that's what we mean by eight free or unspecified electives. Dr Anurag Hingorani As I said, the Bachelor of Business course is very flexible, I'm going to be talking about two additional ways in which you can structure the Bachelor of Business course. Dr Anurag Hingorani So with Option five, you are doing an Extended Major. And a major is eight subjects. And extended major is 12 subjects. And extended majors are available in accounting, economics, finance, management, and marketing. So you might be a student who knows that they only want to specialize in one area, and you decided that's marketing, but you will be doing an extended marketing major. Now, if you do an extended marketing major, that means you're doing 12 subjects within the extended major, that then gives you an option to include a sub major along with the extended nature. So you might do an extended marketing major, maybe a sub-major in finance. Dr Anurag Hingorani And the last way of structuring your Bachelor of Business course, is where you're again, you decided you want to do an extended major. But instead of doing a sub-major, you decide you want to do four free or unspecified electives. Dr Anurag Hingorani So like I said, the Bachelor of Business course is very flexible, you can see that there are different options or ways in which you can structure your course. One thing I could mention is, the course is flexible in that; let's say you start start out with a major, let's say you decide to do it in marketing as your first major. And typically, you will start by doing four subjects within the marketing major. And after you've done this four subjects within the marketing major, you decide now, that's marketing is not for you, or you're not doing well in those subjects. You're not stuck doing a marketing major. If you're feeling that way, you can then decide on another major instead of marketing. So you decide you want to do management, perhaps. But now you have already completed the four subjects within the marketing major. What happens to those, those don't go to waste. Depending on the marketing subjects that you've completed, those could potentially convert to a marketing sub-major, or those could be counted as four free or unspecified electives. So this is another way in which the course is flexible. You might start a major and then decide it's not for you. All is not lost, you could change to another major. And then the subjects you've completed with your previous major would count towards either a sub-major or four free or unspecified electives. Dr Anurag Hingorani So in the Bachelor of Business course, maths is not a prerequisite. However, there is assumed knowledge in maths. What I like to say is if you know what Mean, Median and Mode is, that's great. That's what we mean by assumed knowledge. However, if you haven't studied maths you can take advantage of U-Pass. U-Pass is peer assisted study sessions; this is a student learning program; delivered by students for students. So if you don't have the necessary maths skills, you could also sign up for bridging courses offered by the university. But maths is not a prerequisite though there is assumed knowledge in maths, we certainly don't expect you to have the maths knowledge that you see on the graphic there. Dr Anurag Hingorani So far, I have been talking just about the Bachelor of Business course. But some of you might be interested in combining the Bachelor of Business course with some other courses with some other degrees. As you can see we have a range of combined degree options You will see that some have four year duration, some have a five year duration. Typically, if it's a four year combined degree course, then for the Bachelor of Business component, you will only be doing the Bachelor of Business core and one major, you won't have the other options which I've talked about in terms of four unspecified electives, eight unspecified electives, sub majors etc. Dr Anurag Hingorani So when you're doing a combined degree that is of a duration of four years, you will typically just be doing the Bachelor of Business core subjects, plus one Bachelor of Business major. With the five year combined degrees, you have the option of structuring your Bachelor of Business course in different ways, as I've already talked to you about. Dr Anurag Hingorani Now, most of the combined degree options are with other Bachelor degrees. So you're doing a Bachelor of Business with Bachelor in Biotechnology, you're doing a Bachelor of Business with Bachelor of Creative intelligence and Innovation, so on and so forth. However, there is one combined degree with the Bachelor of Business. And that is the Master of Teaching in Secondary Education. But typically, most of the combined degree options are with other Bachelor degrees. Dr Anurag Hingorani Now, if you don't want to do a combined degree, you just want to do a Bachelor of Business. There are some degree add-ons that are available to you. And there's one that's called Diploma in Languages. So if you're interested in international career, you want to develop your language skills, then you might consider doing a Diploma in Languages as an add on to your Bachelor of Business course. Or you might wish to do a Diploma in Innovation. This add-on is available to any undergraduate university student at UTS. And you will be doing subjects that are offered in the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation, if you complete this Diploma in Innovation as an add-on to your Bachelor of Business course. Dr Anurag Hingorani Now, early on, I said that the Bachelor of Business course is a professional course; majors are accredited by professional bodies, and you will see we have accreditation from Accounting bodies, the Human Resource Institute, for example, and apart from our course being flexible, it is also highly professional course. Dr Anurag Hingorani Now UTS is offering an Early Entry program into the Bachelor of Business program or Bachelor of Business course; where you use your year 11 results to enter UTS. You have to apply to the UTS online application portal. It is free to apply and you only need to apply once. Offers are made on your preferences and based on your year 11 results. Other information is up on the slide. Dr Anurag Hingorani Now my top tip for students considering studying the Bachelor of Business might be straightforward. And it isn't necessarily a tip for the Bachelor of Business course; it is a general tip for students considering University study. And what is my top tip? It is make University your priority. Now you might think what is what does he mean by this make University your priority? Well, for one, you're at university for a limited time period. You're at University for a limited period in your life. So make the most of what university has to offer you should focus on your academic studies, but also make use of the different associations and clubs that are available to you. When employers look for students or potential employees, of course they will take a look at your academic results your academic performance, but they're also looking at well rounded individuals and by participating in different clubs and associations, you will be developing different skills or to come in handy in the workforce. So my top tip to you is, get involved with these different clubs and associations. Participate in your academic studies. Make your diversity a priority. And I know many of you do have a lot of competing priorities. But I would urge you to please please make your diversity a priority, because you will be spending just a few years at university.

Erica - UTS Business School Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining us today where we will be talking about the Bachelor of Economics here at UTS Business School. My name is Erica and joining me is Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova. Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova Good day everyone. My name is Olena Stavrunova and I'm here to talk to you about economics and the Bachelor of Economics course here at UTS. Erica - UTS Business School Now, Olena, economics is a broad topic that touches on a number of concepts. What exactly would you say economics is all about, say in a nutshell? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova Okay, so it's a very broad discipline. So it's very hard to describe in a nutshell. But first and foremost, economics is a social science, which takes a very rigorous approach to analyzing and understanding economic and social issues. In particular, economics focuses on two big questions, how individuals from societies make decisions to allocate scarce resources to meet their needs and wants, and how economic incentives shape behavior. And second question is, what are the consequences of economic decisions for social welfare? And how can government policies change economic behavior and welfare? Understanding economics is very important. It's fundamental for making good business decisions, good government decisions, careful study of social issues. Erica - UTS Business School So Olena, why should students study this discipline? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova Okay, so there are many reasons why students should study economics. One of these reasons is that economics graduates are very highly employable. They have very diverse employment opportunities in industry and government, they also have great further education opportunities, in tertiary education sector, as Honours program, Master's degree or PhD degree. I should say that most graduate recruitment programs in large organisations employ economists Be it financial institutions, such as banks, consultancies, government departments, and so on. Why are economists valued? They are valued because they have excellent analytical skills. They're valued for their ability to work with data and for a systematic approach that they take to understanding the issue or problem. Another reason why you should study economics, economics is a very broad field of study that has applications to many industries, not only the traditional ones, such as banking, finance, consulting, but also health, education, sports, urban development, and so on. This means that you can pursue many passions and interests while studying economics, and that your potential career path after economics degree can be very diverse and can be chosen to suit your passions and interests. Some interesting economic challenges and social issues that economics can help solve. For example, inequality. One of the biggest economic challenges of modern times is a growing economic inequality has been rising share sharply over the last few decades. Economics will help you understand the reasons behind the recent rise in inequality, consequences of inequality for people and societies and policy options that exist to tackle this issue. Another important social problems that economics can address is climate change. Reduction in green house gas emissions is the key to reducing global warming. And the main question is how governments across the world can create incentives for companies to reduce emissions. Since economics is all about economic incentives and behavior, and how they affect behavior, understanding economics is crucial for being able to formulate effective policies for combating global warming. Another issue where economics can help is understanding wage gap. What explains gender wage gap? What is the relative cost of labor market discrimination, and differences in productive characteristics of men and women that contribute to the existing wage gap that we find here in the labor market? Economics subject Labour Economics will help you understand this issue a little bit better. And so another example where economics is helpful is in understanding the implications of a trade war between the US and China, and economics fields, such as macroeconomics, international trade, and game theory provide more insights on this issue. Erica - UTS Business School Thanks, Olena. It's obviously got many, many applications to many global issues. And I guess one specifically relevant one to us right now is with the COVID situation that's happening all around us. How would you explain economics relevance to that? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova Indeed, the current COVID crisis is a complex crisis affecting public health and the economy profoundly. And economists have been heavily involved in debating about and formulating policy responses. Sometimes when you listen to those debates, it may seem like the debates about health versus jobs or health versus economics, but in fact, it is not like that. In developing economic policies, economics and economists seek to maximize social welfare, and this welfare includes the value of people's health and life. So it's not health versus economics, it's how to choose a policy that maximizes the value of both. One of the interesting things about the current situation is that is a classic case of the market with externalities, which we know would not function really well without government intervention. So if someone catches viruses, they'll have a negative effect on the people around them. So the situation is not socially optimal. And one way the government can solve this problem is by limiting the behavior, which results in an externality. This is why we have lockdowns, lockdowns is a way for the government to improve the behavior which is currently not socially optimal. And then, other policies implemented during COVID are also founded on economics. For example, programs such as JobKeeper and JobSeeker, are an example of the fiscal policy that governments often engage in during today's economic downturns. So to understand and contribute to political debate during the current era it is important to be well versed in economics. Erica - UTS Business School Wonderful, thank you for that Olenaa, it's clearly a very important time to be learning about these kinds of things. But other than that, what other skills could students expect to gain from studying economics? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova It is well known that students who have completed an economics degree are regarded as analytical thinkers, they tend to be professionals who are very skilled in working with data, who know how to produce problems systematically, how to pinpoint important aspects to put aside unimportant ones, and how to take into account interplay between different factors. But they also learn about the variety of economic, business, and social issues where an economic approach can provide effective solutions. The Bachelor of Economics program is very applied. Most of our subjects will include case studies and some real life applications of tools and techniques that the students learn throughout the degree. And as I was saying earlier, because economics is such a general field, the skills that economists have are valued very broadly, among a variety of industries, employers and occupations. Erica - UTS Business School It seems like a very interesting area of study, that's for sure. And you can study economics at a number of different universities. But why should students come to UTS to study this discipline? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova Well, there are many reasons why you should study economics at UTS. First, economics department at UTS is still a very young department, in fact, we're celebrating our 10th anniversary this year, but we've been consistently ranked among the top economics departments in Australia for research in such fields as economic theory, econometrics and applied economics. So taking an economics degree in UTS means that you will be learning from nationally and internationally recognized experts in this field. Second, not only we're great in research, we are also great at teaching economics. Our lecturers, our academics are highly regarded as engaging and innovative educators, they tend to have high student evaluations, SFS, they win many teaching awards at the level of the Business School, University, and nationally. Another advantage of studying economics and business at UTS is its geographic location, just 10 minutes from Central Station so it's easily accessible from all Sydney suburbs. Also, it is close to the CBD. So it's convenient for students who want to combine work and study, but also the engagement opportunities that faculty here and students have are fantastic. We have all sorts of things for the students in terms of engaging, including mentoring programs, research partnerships, alumni events, guest lectures, recruitment events, and so on. And these activities stem not only from our geographic proximity to the CBD, but also from the concerted effort of many economics academics to create strong links. Erica - UTS Business School Now, the Bachelor of economics is a very flexible degree as we can see in the possible structures that are shown here. Olena, are you able to talk through how students can choose to structure their degrees? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova So, indeed this as a quite flexible degree. So what components does it consist of, so there are 11 core economic subjects, these subjects will equip with you with some fundamental skills of economic analysis that are essential for any economist in any sector or role, then you can choose three economics elective subjects. And we have a wide choice of electives, about 10 subjects. We have labour economics, public economics, market design, economics of monetary policy, and many others. So you can tailor your choice of electives to your tastes and preferences. Then you have the freedom of what to study in 10 subjects not allocated to economics curriculum. Here you have three options, you can use these subjects to specialize or to major, in one other business discipline, for example, such as finance, or marketing, and many others. To major in any of these disciplines, you have to complete eight prescribed subjects from this discipline. Or you can do option two, to submajors by completing four prescribed subjects from each of the two disciplines of your choosing. Or finally, you can do option three, one submajor plus six elective business subjects, which means you will take four prescribed subjects towards the chosen sub major, and you can take any six subjects from across the Business School, so it's very flexible and you can indulge your interests and passions while doing our economics degree. Erica - UTS Business School So to start their degree students undertake a number of core subjects, what kind of knowledge do you think they will gain from these subjects? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova Like I said, these four subjects will equip you with fundamental skills of economic analysis. For example, in Introductory and Intermediate Microeconomics core subjects, students will learn to analyze economic behavior of people and finance and their interactions in various types of markets. In Introductory and Intermediate Macroeconomics core subjects, you will learn about the behavior of the economy as a whole. You will learn about concepts like GDP, unemployment, inflation, interest rate, monitoring, fiscal government policies, economic growth, and so on. There are also three subjects in the poll in which you will learn how to analyze quantitative data for economic and business decision making. These include Business Statistics, and econometric subjects, Introductory Econometrics and Empirical Methods for Policy Evaluation. The economics core also includes the subject Quantitative Methods in Economics and Business, where you will learn mathematical tools, you will need throughout the degree. If you think that your math is not good enough to succeed in economics, please do not worry, we will teach you all the methods you need for the degree in this subject. Another core subject is Strategic Decision Making. In this subject, you will learn to analyze strategic interactions between market participants. The ideas and methods of game theory are particularly applicable to social, business, or economic situations, where you have small number of players or participants, and the roles of any participant depends on the strategies or behaviors chosen by other players. For example, in economics and business these ideas are useful for understanding competition and collusion between companies, auctions, formation of social networks, trade wars between countries and so on. Behavioural Economics is a new core subject, which we will discuss in a couple of slides. It's an important subject that we're very proud to have as a core from 2022, from next year. Also, towards the end of the course, you will complete an economics capstone, a subject where you will learn how to analyze economic policy using real life case studies and scenarios. We will talk about this subject in detail as well in the next couple of slides. Erica - UTS Business School Thank you for that Olena. So one way of structuring the degree as you've mentioned earlier would be for students to choose a major, are you able to briefly touch on what a major is and how that would complement the study of economics? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova A major is a specialisation in a non economics field of study. And this slide shows the majors that are available with the Bachelor of Economics. Some of the popular majors among our students are finance and marketing, because these disciplines have a lot of overlap with economics in terms of the social and business phenomena that they study as well as the logical approaches. But if you are interested in other fields, you will not be disadvantaged by choosing a major in say, business law, management or IT. Major is about diversification, acquiring different skills than what you learn in the economics degree. It's also about complementarity, acquiring skills that will complement or help your career path in economics. Erica - UTS Business School Another way of structuring the degree would be to choose one or two sub majors. So what exactly is a sub major, Olena? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova A sub major is also a specialisation in non-economics study, but it's not as deep and profound as the major. To complete a sub major, you need to complete 4 subjects, 4 prescribed subjects from that discipline. And you can complete two sub majors. And again, you're free to choose the sub major that you want. With economics, I think submajors such as statistics, information, technology, marketing, finance, would work really, really well. Erica - UTS Business School So as you mentioned, new for 2022 is the subject behavioral economics. What exactly is this subject all about? And what are the benefits in studying it for students? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova We're very glad to offer behavioural economics as a core subject in our Bachelor of Economics degree. So the behavioural economics perspective recognises that people are not calculating machines who always make rational decisions with the sole purpose of maximizing their economic well being. Behavioural economics studies how non economic factors such as psychological, cognitive, emotional, and social factors affect economic decisions. The importance of the behavioural approach has been recognised by researchers and academics in the majority of fields in economics, such as financial economics, public economics, labor economics, health economics, industrial organisation, to name a few. Several Nobel Prizes have been awarded to economists for doing research that advances the behavioural economics perspective. The behavioural approach is also increasingly popular in government and industry, where behavioural economics units are being created to inject this perspective into solving policy business problems. Nowadays, any economics graduate should have a good grasp of behavioural economics. Because this is where research and industry are going. We are confident that giving behavioural economics more prominence in the Bachelor of Economics degree will make our graduates more employable. Also, I would like to add that UTS is a great place to study behavioural economics. UTS Business School and economics departments are lucky to have several academics with stellar international research and reputation in behavioural economics. These academics also have an excellent track record of engagement with industry and government. Furthermore, we have a state of the art Behavioural Lab where students can engage with behavioural research as part of their the economics curriculum, as well as their extracurricular activity. And finally, we have the Behavioural Economics Student Society where students can network, connect and take part in various activities related to behavioural economics. Erica - UTS Business School So the capstone subject for the Bachelor of economics has recently been revised. Olena, what exactly is a capstone and what do students do in this subject? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova A capstone subject is a third year subject that students take towards the completion of a degree, it is, so to speak, a crown jewel of the degree, where students learn to apply their analytical and data modeling skills to analyse important, real world, economic and social issues. So they study issues like economic inequality, gender pay gap, labor market discrimination, socio-economic disparities in educational attainment and health status, environmental degradation, Indigenous matters, and other topics. In this subject, the students use real world case studies to develop skills in evaluating existing policies, in the areas I've mentioned, as well as in formulating new effective policies to existing economic and social problems. Erica - UTS Business School Our economics alumni end up working for some very impressive companies as well as government departments. Olena, are you able to provide a bit more detail about what kind of jobs students can expect to gain after finishing the course? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova Yes, of course, Erica. Economics alumni end up everywhere, in every sector of the economy. You can probably find an economics alumni even in policy, and antiterrorist departments in law enforcement. But they are particularly concentrated in the corporate world, such as financial institutions, banks and consultancies. Some of the biggest employers ofour graduates are the big Australian banks and consulting companies, but our graduates also work in other sectors such as insurance, logistics, energy, real estate, public sector, and others. I should say that quite a number of our alumni end up in the public sector in places like Treasury, Reserve Bank, Department of Education, Department of Health, and others. Economic graduates can be employed in a variety of roles including economist, financial analyst, investment analyst, market analyst, data analyst, researcher, policy analyst, and many others. You see, the job title economist is only one among a variety of career paths that economics graduates can take. Erica - UTS Business School So many students choose to do a combined degree. Maybe because they are interested in two separate fields of study. They might want more diverse career paths, some aren't too sure what they want to do after they're finished with university. What are some of the combined degree options that are available to them, Olena? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova Starting from 2022, we have three combined degree options that are available with a Bachelor of Economics. First double or combined degree option is the Bachelor of Economics, Bachelor of Laws. This is a five years study. And it is for students who want to become lawyers with thorough knowledge of economics. This kind of a skill set is very variable if one wants to practice business or taxation law. The two other combined degrees are the new combined degrees which we launched in 2022. The Bachelor of Economics, Bachelor of Sustainability and Environment is a four year degree. It is a natural combination of degrees for students who are interested in economics and environmental issues. This degree will produce economists with specific skills to analyse economics decisions and policies in the areas of sustainability and environment. The Bachelor of Sustainability and Environment component will provide knowledge of natural and social sciences, and political landscapes that pertain to sustainability environment. This double degree opens up careers in companies and government agencies engaged specifically with issues of environment, cultural and social sustainability, climate and sustainable development. And finally, the combined degree Bachelor of Economics, Masters of Teaching in Secondary Education is a unique offering in New South Wales. Upon completion of this degree, graduates will have Bachelor of Economics and Masters of Teaching in Secondary Education, and can be qualified to teach Business Studies and Economics in New South Wales secondary schools. So if you're interested in pursuing a career as a high school teacher focused on Economics and Business Studies, this option is right for you. Erica - UTS Business School Thank you for that Olena. And there are some other ways to add to your degree other than doing a combined program. If students want to diversify their degree with some additional skills, they can choose to do a diploma or they can go on exchange. So we have a couple of options on our screen here now, we've got the Diploma of Innovation, which is an exciting opportunity for students who want to add interdisciplinary skills to their degree. It borrows from subjects that are taught in the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation course. So it's a great way of diversifying their skills, learning about creativity in the workforce and how they can innovate in their chosen field. We've also got the Diploma of Languages, so if students want to gain language and cultural skills, this would also be excellent if they wanted to work overseas or pursue international options in their career, it can help them build a professional identity and a range of capabilities to prepare them for working in international environments and with you know, different cultures. Back to you Olena, now. What would be your number one tip for students contemplating choosing the Bachelor of Economics at UTS? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova Okay, my top tip would be, you can just follow your passions and interests by working on your economics degree. And, importantly, keep in touch with your university teachers. Academics are a great resource that a university has to offer, and academics in the economics department are exceptional in their knowledge of economics, and in their willingness to engage with the students. So I urge you to take full advantage of the interaction opportunities in class and after class, come to office hours, participate in extra credit learning activities, and so on. I'm sure that this additional knowledge you gain from these interactions and connections you develop with academics as well as with your fellow students will be invaluable for your professional growth as an economist, while completing your degree, as well as after you have completed and left university. So I wish you all the best with your choice of course, here at UTS, or elsewhere. And if you have any questions, please let me know. Send me an email and I will be happy to talk to you in greater detail about the Bachelor of Economics. Erica - UTS Business School Wonderful. Thank you for that, Olena. Thank you so much for your time. And thank you everyone for tuning in. Please feel free to explore our other videos detailing our courses and our majors that are available. If you have any questions you can reach out to us via our social media channels, which are up on the screen or you can email business@uts.edu.au. Thank you again for tuning in. And we'll see you at our next video. Hi everybody, Daryl Adair here. I'm the director of the Bachelor of Management, and I've been involved in the teaching of sport, business, and management for about 25 years. It's my passion, and it's an area of the Bachelor of Management as well. Now, before that, I had a 10-year career in banking, and you'll find that several of the staff that teaches across the Bachelor of Management have a similar background to mine. That is, they have industry experience, and have since taken up the opportunity of teaching in higher education. So, your lecturers often have a combination of both practical and academic expertise. You might have noticed that in addition to the Bachelor of Management, there's also the Bachelor of Business. So why might students take up the Bachelor of Management? Well, this degree allows students to develop deep knowledge in one or more of the experience industries, as we call them. Now, the experience industry comprises a range of goods and services that are central to the consumption of entertainment and leisure activities, whether that be live or in digital form. Now, in the case of the Bachelor of Management, our focus is on events, sport business, and the digital creative industries, and I'll go through each of them in detail in a moment. If we look momentarily at the Bachelor of Business, the management major within that degree does provide exposure to that kind of knowledge, along with opportunities for in-depth skill development in more generic areas, like accounting and economics. But students who seek to be experts in one or more of the industry sectors in the experience economy are best advised to take the Bachelor of Management because it provides deep knowledge of those industries. So, you might then ask, who is the Bachelor of Management degree for? Well, it's for people who are interested in and passionate about the various creative enterprises across three areas: sport business, events, and digital spaces. And typically, these are people who like to work in a really vibrant occupational culture. They're interested in shaping products and services that are part of the entertainment and experience sectors. Now, each of these industries is today very high tech, and they rely on what we call design thinking, digital creativity, and innovation. People who are involved in these industries are not pigeonholed, for their skill sets can be applied across the experience and entertainment industries. So, for example, a student might start off in events, then they might take those event management skills into a role in the sport industry, and so on. In other words, these programs are for people who are adaptable and novel in terms of their thinking, and of course, very astute in terms of digital and creative ways of doing business. Now, everybody realises, of course, the impact on the Australian experience and entertainment sector as a consequence of COVID. Many of the major events and sport competitions that we've grown to love in Australia have been impacted. But, as you will have seen, we're now witnessing a substantial rebound in the experience economy, as people seek to reclaim live entertainment and leisure activities in the public domain. And were observing as part of this resurgence, new forms of leisure consumption, such as demand for virtual events, with patrons paying on-demand for online versions of what were previously exclusively live experiences. So, within the Bachelor of Management, we look at adaptations across the experience economy, in large part as a consequence of the challenge of COVID. In sport, for instance, students learn about the growing phenomenon of spectators around the world, watching American basketball, using virtual reality headsets. This technology gives consumers the impression that they're inside the NBA court and experiencing the sights and sounds of being a patron of the game. The other thing is, there's the potential for augmented reality, and in sport, the area I'm most familiar with, broadcasts, are now overlaid with data on the broadcast screen, which can provide things like player statistics and messages from sponsors, and so on. Thus, there's a lot of value added to the digital production of entertainment. So, in summary, although COVID has impacted on live experiences, there's been both a revival and adaptations, where students are able to explore and learn about this in the Bachelor of Management. So, how is the course structured? How does it work? Well, it's important in the first instance, to note that the Bachelor of Management underwent review in 2020. This is a routine exercise, and it is always productive. We invited industry stakeholders and students to provide feedback about the structure and the topics we had to offer, and we were pleased to learn that there were substantial endorsements of what it is we offer. But as I will soon explain, we've instituted some changes with the goal of making the degree more flexible for students. Now to start with, everyone in the Bachelor of Management has 8 core subjects, which you can see on the slide. In essence, they take you through foundational areas of business, like marketing, accounting, economics, human resources, law, and ethics. And additionally, there's an emphasis on managerial skills. So, once you're involved in a business, you need to scope the competitive environment. And of course, also make strategic decisions about your strengths, your weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. So, the Bachelor of Management core is a very important, multidisciplinary foundation, from which students then generate sufficient skills that can be deployed in one or more of these sport events, and digital creative sectors. Now, if we look at the major, it's comprised of eight subjects for each of your chosen areas, and with each of these majors, the relevant subjects are available for students to look at, via the UTS website. Now, I'd go through all of them here with you, but there's 32 in all, so too many to discuss in this brief presentation. But what you'll see when you get to the web, is the students have an opportunity to pursue their chosen major right from the very beginning of their degree, and then in every year of their degree. That's very different to the Bachelor of Business, where students do a generic core in their first year, but they don't get to focus on their major until second and third years. By contrast, as I've already mentioned, in the Bachelor of Management students can follow their passion as soon as they begin the course. Now, in terms of changes to the programme, the biggest adjustment we've made to the Bachelor of Management is to ensure that students now have more choices in terms of what they want to learn, and as the slide indicates, there's space for eight unspecified subjects, which can be configured according to student preferences. For example, someone might start with a major in events, but then develop a strong interest in sport business. There's now scope for them to do a double major. Equally, a student might start with a major in events, but, you know, find they have an emerging interest in sport business. Students can also do a major of their choosing, along with four randomly selected electives, so they don't even have to do sub-majors if they don't want to. Indeed, students may choose unspecified subjects as electives of their choice for all eight of these options. But the question is, why might a student do that? Well, they might decide that they need more, for example, accounting and finance skills, so that when they get into an industry environment, they've got strong fiscal literacy. Or, a student might say, look, I really want to go deeper in terms of marketing, so I'll go and do more marketing subjects. Others might simply say, look, I really want to just learn something new, something else. I want to do a language, or I want to understand more about international relations, whatever it is, so these electives are available for students to choose as they please. But they're intended to really add value to what students are interested in. Now, one of the real fabulous parts of this degree, is innovation and entrepreneurship, and they are embedded in the Bachelor of Management. But what do they mean? Well, innovation basically means conceiving something new, it can be an idea. It can be a product prototype, a process, or indeed a service. Innovations need creativity and deep thinking. Innovation may mean invention, though, it may also just add value to an existing product or service. Now, entrepreneurship is related to innovation, but it's different. Basically, it means turning ideas into a business opportunity by exercising judgement about a risk, and the risk is intended to turn obviously, into a profit rather than a loss. So, in essence, entrepreneurship sets out to create value, or add value in terms of innovation. In that sense, entrepreneurs need skills like planning, decision making, leadership, and of course, what it means to be a risk taker. Now, in the Bachelor of Management, there are two core subjects devoted to innovation and entrepreneurship, you can see them on the slide here. One of them interrogates the conceptual frameworks that underpin product service and design, while the other is more hands on and practical, with students building on models or prototypes in a lab setting, and this combination of theory and practice is popular with students, who are then equipped to navigate new opportunities across the experience in entertainment industries. Indeed, owing to the challenges of COVID, these sectors are innovating in really dynamic, novel ways with a goal of reaching digital and remote audiences that weren't even thought of previously. An example is live streaming of music concerts, so big events with a pay per view model, and there's also great potential with Virtual Reality entertainment. Imagine being courtside at Wimbledon, or virtually climbing Mount Everest on the back of a sherpa, all experienced virtually through my Oculus headsets at home. Indeed, this type of innovation has great potential for people who are of mature age and thus not very mobile, people with disabilities, all of whom are unable to travel easily, and so these kinds of digital entertainment experiences are more relevant than ever. All that said, of course, all that creativity is absolutely vital, as is the technological know-how. But it is also vital to have management skills. You know, it's important to be creative, to understand the way in which entrepreneurship functions, but you must have skills as a manager to bring products and services to market, so managing innovation and entrepreneurship are also vital. Now, one of the great features of the Bachelor of Management that has been round for about 25 years is the opportunity to do an internship, and that's really important for students who want to experience what it's like to work in a particular industry sector. The way in which it functions is that students, they target an organisation they'd like to have an internship with, and they seek permission from that company to take them on as an intern. Now, the university can help, we can provide a list of companies with whom we've had internship relations with, in the past. So as an example, if you're interested in working at sports clubs, many of our students have had very successful internships at say, the Sydney Swans and the Sydney Roosters, and what happens is that students work from around 120 hours or so depending on the organisation and the nature of their assignment. This is, in essence, volunteer, unpaid work, but it's recognised as a contribution to the internship subject, that is part of the degree. So, there's a clear benefit in doing it. Now, the purpose of being an intern isn't simply for students to go to one organisation, and make people cups of coffee, and you know, operate a photocopier. Instead, they work on a project that is agreed upon by the student, by the organisation, and by the university, so it's co-managed. The student is then evaluated in terms of the way they conduct themselves professionally in a workplace setting, and of course, a big focus is on the project that they ultimately deliver, which, of course, is assessed by the internship provider, and the university. Now, one of the real benefits of this, I think, is having that tangible, industry engagement, that workplace experience, which allows students to have a taste of what it is like to work in that sector, but also start to develop a network of individuals that they can turn to in respect of employment opportunities. So, one of the things that we encourage UTS is for our interns and our students more generally, to set up a profile on LinkedIn, and as part of that, they upload a CV. They can also include their internship experience. Another benefit of the internship is that students can ask the employer for a reference for when they seek job opportunities, and the idea of course, is for them to secure a job with the company they worked with, and there are some examples of that. But generally speaking, the internship is an experiential pathway into work. Now, one of the things that is new about the degree this year is we are offering an alternative subject to the internship and that is called diversity management. So why have we brought this subject in and what are the benefits in studying it? Now there are two reasons why we decided to introduce diversity management. The first is quite practical. It's that the internship I just spoke about, it used to be a compulsory subject. However, we've since realised that it was preferable to make it as an optional subject, recognising that some students were coming into our degrees with workplace experience already, and thus the internship wasn't going to be relevant or necessary for their experience. So, we thought, okay, let's make this an option for the students and my students still, you know, opt for the internship, because they don't have that work experience. But there's another more fundamental reason for us offering diversity management as an alternative, but also as an elective for anybody taking the Bachelor of Management. That is, if we look at the contemporary workplace in Australia, it features employees from very different backgrounds, and one of the benefits really of studying and appreciating diversity management is the opportunity for workplaces to encourage people from different backgrounds to reach their potential and maximise their contributions to an organisation's strategic goals and objectives. And this is a core part of what progressive businesses seek to achieve in today's cosmopolitan world. There is a recognition that people from different cultures, different parts of the world, different language skills, different religions, and so on, come together in a work environment, so how to bring about an awareness of their commonalities, their similarities, and also the differences and to generate respect for each other in a really collegial way. So, there's a raft of research internationally, that shows that organisations which embrace diversity management, exemplify environments in which people are happier at work, they feel more valued, and they tend to be more productive. So, diversity management is good business. And it's also a great option even for students who take the internship, they can still do diversity management as an elective. So, there's opportunities to do both. Now, if we're looking at the major options in the Bachelor of Management, what is there available? What exactly do they involve? Well, there are three, so there's certainly choice. Let's start by considering Events as the key example. Now, it's an exciting place to work because of the really dynamic and varied nature of this industry. There are events that are part of the calendar every year, as well as events that are established for what you might call special purposes. And let's face it, Sydney has long been Australia's premier event city. So, you know, events are part of this city's DNA. But what does Event Management involve? Well, it focuses on the logistics of establishing events, promoting them, marketing, ticketing, things like traffic and security management. And this means meeting the requirements of law, policy, and governments when putting on an event. Indeed, the whole events ecosystem now requires tremendous sophistication, because while we all want things to go well, there are important mechanisms and protocols for when things actually go wrong, and there are problems. So, if you're taking event management, you will be exposed to a whole range of concepts and also their practical application. And Australia, let's face it, is a world leader here. The academic contribution to the way events has grown here in Australia and their sophistication means that this country is renowned for staging mega events. And, you know, we'll soon be hosting the Olympics again in 2032, and next year, we will host the FIFA World Cup. These are just two examples of the reputation that Australia has for hosting huge events like this of international significance. Now the second major I want to speak about is Sport Business. Sports in this country and internationally have been a fast-growing industry for decades. If we look at Australia, it's the only country for example, with four professional football coats. And no other country has as many national sport competitions at the professional level, as does Australia. And another important trend in this country, particularly, is the growth of women's professional sport competitions. So, we're talking about a very dynamic environment. But to actually manage the sport industry requires very important skill sets. You need to have individuals with a strong understanding of accounting, finance and revenue, and, of course, innovative ideas about creating alternate revenue streams, and even alternative products. I mean, one of the most interesting growth areas we cover in the Bachelor of Management is something called e-sport. So that's, you know, electronic gaming that's competitive, you know, like an elite sport. And what we saw during COVID, was this grew exponentially, it was already growing, but the trajectory just went through the roof. An interesting development is that many traditional sports now have a relationship or even a partnership with an esports team. So, the point I'm making is, it's not just about traditional sport, there's also a growing digitization around which sport is consumed. The third major I want to speak about is the Digital Creative Enterprise option, which is really the new one in our repertoire. The other majors have been at UTS for about 25 years, and this one for about five years. But, this major reflects the way in which the digital world is evolving. It reflects the way in which businesses themselves intimately and almost inherently engage with a business today. And I don't mean just from a sort of a, you know, a marketing and website perspective, but how they address strategic issues. Indeed, how they assess problems in the marketplace now requires a digital scoping exercise. And in doing so, they're applying design thinking principles that students need to learn about, which are more adaptable and complex than traditional modes of business thinking. Now, this kind of approach can be used in any business that has a digital shopfront today, and it's hard to think of one that doesn't. But also, one of the reasons that we position this major here, amongst the other two, is we think there's a good synergy between the way in which those other majors are evolving, along with the digital creative enterprises. And we're very excited about this new offering. So, beyond that, students might choose to do a combined degree because they're interested in you know, two complementary fields of study. And so there's three here on the slide. You can combine your degree with Creative Intelligence and Innovation, if you're interested in sustainability and the environment, there's an option there. And also international studies if you're interested in languages, and understanding the way in which the world works. So, there are also degree addons. If students are interested in, for example, learning a language, there's a Diploma of Languages. And also, for students who are really captivated by learning about innovation in the Bachelor of Management, there's also a Diploma of Innovation as well. For students these days, UTS offers an early entry program, so you can actually utilise your Year 11 results to make an application to join us. As you'll see from the slide, there's some information from this website here about your eligibility, how you go about applying, and when you might receive an offer. So, what is my top tip for students taking the Bachelor of Management? Well, I think follow your passion. It's easy to say that you should get a job that you enjoy, rather than a job that is merely expected of you by others. But everybody needs to get out of bed in the morning and go to work and feel engaged by it. And if you feel a particular connection to one of the industry sectors I've talked about, go for it. Because what you want to do is have lifelong fulfilment and enjoyment, and a feeling of being connected to your workplace. So, if you want more info on the slide here, you can download our undergraduate course guide for 2023, in which you will find information about the Bachelor of Management. And of course, you can stay connected with us. We're on Facebook, we're on Instagram, and you can reach us via email at any time. And look, I do hope that I get to see many of you at UTS in the coming years, and that you enjoy your experience with us. Thank you very much. Professor Suzanne Benn Sustainability is relevant to all aspects of the business curriculum, and to many aspects of our research. The way we feel about it here in this business school is you can't just consider the financial returns alone . . . that inherent in that is consideration of other sorts of capital such as social capital, trust, collaboration . . . intellectual capital or the human capital of the workforce. And of course that that all rests on the basis of the availability of resources which are the natural resources, so the natural capital. The value of natural capital and availability of resources. So all those different forms of capital are emphasised to the students and incorporated in one way or another into our research projects. Doctor Paul Brown Okay, so the energy efficiency project was the integration of energy efficiency principles into a whole bunch of our subjects, both undergraduate and postgraduate. One of our assignments which we actually did with UTS Green which was a lot of fun, where we actually had students, we gave them access to the university’s energy systems to some extent, like some building information and some energy experts, and we gave them some problems which are faced by UTS and we said: 'Hey, go and try and find a way to solve this from an accounting point of view.’ The base set of materials was schematics like building schematics and so the students were looking at who needs what data to then control energy. There is actually so many things that the students recommended that we actually had, we even had to organise a presentation at one stage. I think we had about 6, 5 or 6 groups present their recommendations and each group had maybe, I don't know 2,3,4 recommendations and they presented to senior UTS staff, and that was a lot of fun for the students. The energy efficiency project was actually a really nice context in which we could teach students how to help organisations move incrementally towards sustainability. Dr Amanda White 0:00 Welcome everybody to Accounting Options at the UTS Business School. My name is Dr. Amanda White. I'm a senior lecturer and Deputy Head Education of the Accounting discipline group. I'm also a UTS business alumni with a major in accounting and also professional experience in accounting at PricewaterhouseCoopers. So i keep in touch with the industry and I'm really proud of what we have here at UTS in terms of accounting, and I'm going to tell you all about that. So let's talk about what is accounting. And a lot of students will know accounting has something to do with numbers and it's something to do with money, but it is the language of business; all around the world, we speak the same language in terms of accounting. And it's recording and interpreting business events to inform business decisions. So accounting helps people in business, make the decisions about research and development, marketing, innovation, moving into a new country, COVID related decisions, all of those decisions are made using accounting information. So it's a critical underpinning of business, all around the world. And no matter which country you go to - Japan, the United States, Zimbabwe, the UK, the EU, we're all speaking actually the same language of accounting; so it's a very highly transferable skill. Now accounting is not all about the numbers, numbers are important. But realistically, when it comes to mathematics, I use my phone as my calculator a lot of the time. And it's not just good for mathematicians. And it's not about sitting in an office crunching the numbers by yourself. Technology has transformed the role of accountants, where we manually used to do a lot of the number crunching most of that is now automated and so our role is to take that information and interpret it to provide businesses with direction and advice on how they can use this accounting information, combined with non-accounting information they might have from marketing or production, or a social media engagement, for example, to help them make the best business decisions to optimize their achievement of their goals. So it's really problem solving. And quite often, we now see accountants described as business partners, because we are partnering with different types / parts of the business, to help them achieve their goals. So a lot of leaders really have that accounting background, because to be able to lead a company to be able to be a CEO or director of an organization you need to be on do you need to understand how the fundamentals of the business really work. So people say, Oh, look, I'm great at maths is accounting for me? I said, well, if you're great at problem solving, and you love working with people, talking with people getting to understand their businesses, to be able to provide advice, then accounting is for you. Communication is the number one non-technical skill that our profession says that we need more of in accountants, that's the number one thing they look for, is those communication, group work and interpersonal skills. So accounting is always in demand. And people that say are AI and all of this robotics, etc. machine learning is going to take over the role of accounting. And if COVID-19 has taught us anything, there is a massive demand for accountants; when times are good financially to provide advice but also when businesses are struggling. So it's useful across all areas of business. And there are accountants and all sorts of different job opportunities from really big companies like the Commonwealth Bank, EY, Macquarie Group, etc. Like you see there, right down to smaller businesses. And I don't know how many people out there might follow Chebbo's on, or Chebbo's Burgers on Instagram, and on Tik Tok, if you have let me know in the chat. Ali Chebbani is actually one of our UTS Business graduates. He uses his business knowledge, his accounting knowledge he was in my class, to actually set up this massive, you know, well, massive for him, business empire that now includes partnerships with brands like KFC, and other institutions. So, accounting can be a role in a job like a big organization. You can be an accountant working for yourself, working part time, working flexible hours. I have a great colleague in Brisbane, and you know 20 years ago, she was a virtual accountant. She has run her accounting practice from all around the world, taking advantage of digital technology. Accountants also work within organizations. But we also have lots of students who study accounting and go to create their own businesses work in finance work in marketing. It is the ultimate pair for any of your business studies because no matter what business program or business role you end up in, someone's gonna say, How much is this going to cost? How do I know if this is a benefit? Are we making money based on this particular program. So accounting is critical in all business applications. So students learn to think through problems, big problems, small problems, every business needs an accountant. And once you understand how the business works, and how the accounting works, you have such great insight into the entire organization. We're also accredited through our professional association, so CPA Australia, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. So when you study accounting at UTS, which is the Accounting major plus an additional subject in law and ethics, then you are eligible once you finish your degree at UTS, to then be able to start the professional qualification programs for accountants. So it's quite common, and most accountants within the industry all should have a professional qualification designation that is offered by one of these major bodies. That sends a signal that you are qualified to work as an accountant and to provide advice. These extra programs are usually 18 months to two years. And it's not just an additional study program, but it's also mentored work experience. But UTS helps set you up for the foundations to go into one of these programs through our accredited accounting programs. So why would you study accounting at UTS? We are top 100 in the world, ranked for accounting and finance, not only do we have a great location; though your location right now is wherever you are connecting to us from; but for those who are working out potentially working full time or part time and studying, we have a great central location. When I was making my choice, I had a cadetship at PricewaterhouseCoopers. And trying to figure out which university I wanted to go to, you know that I live out in the Blacktown LGA, I needed to find somewhere that was close to a train station easy to access and had lots of flexibility. So UTS provides that and we're very flexible in terms of delivery model, and also class times. And UTS is Australia's number one Young University. So we're very young institution. 35 years young, I believe we are, but number one in our young universities. So what are the sort of options you have in studying accounting? You might think, okay, well, I want to study a bit of accounting, but I don't necessarily want to be an accountant. The accounting and practice sub-major might be for you. It's four subjects that give you a real hands on feel for doing accounting in that small business context. If you think well actually, I want to move out of that small business context and perhaps pursue accounting as a career, the accounting major is a great start with eight subjects. And then we also have the extended major. So if you're absolutely sure, yep, accounting is the path I want to go. You can do an extended major in accounting, as all part of the Bachelor of Business. We also have the Bachelor of Accounting, which is a separate degree program that's a scholarship program for students who want to build their accounting career. It's pretty much the same subjects as the Bachelor of Business; there's a few little extra subjects that the students do, but they also have two paid internships, as well as their scholarship included in their degree. Now, it's a separate application process for that. So you just search Bachelor of Accounting UTS on your search engine, and it will bring up all of the information. There's an application form, as well as interview processes to select candidates, and it's our industry partners, actually, that help us select our candidates for the Bachelor of Accounting program. But if you don't get into the Bachelor of Accounting, lots of students who don't get into that, (because there's only 35 places) come into the Bachelor of Business and study an Accounting major, or the new extended accounting, extended major that's coming in 2022. So I mentioned the major, extended major, or the sub-major now what happens in each of those? Well, in the Bachelor of Business, everybody starts with the same core eight subjects, as in the Bachelor of Accounting that makes sure that our accountants, understand marketing, understand economics, understand business, finance and statistics. So you get that broad base, and a lot of students will come into the Bachelor of Business not sure what major; they might think accounting, but the core gives everybody a chance to try out all of the different majors, and then make a decision. Now I mentioned the accounting major, you can do those eight subjects and combine that with a second major. Really popular is finance; also really popular is accounting with marketing, accounting with information technology. You could do two sub-majors, which are four subjects each; you might think I really like accounting, I want to do a bit of marketing and a bit of finance, you can do that with a sub-major, which is just four subjects, you can do a sub-major and electives. So if you think I'd like to do a, perhaps an exchange when we can travel again, then there's opportunities there, or eight electives. We've also got the accounting major, which is the eight subjects in a major plus four other subjects, which could include an internship if you're interested in doing that, with options of a sub-major and electives. Or if you do the accounting in practice sub-major, you might say, okay, I'm going to do marketing and then I'm going to do a sub-major in accounting, and then maybe a sub-major in something else, or some electives. So big thank you to Sara there as well, who said that, with the extended major, the accounting major, the sub-major, it's all noted on your academic transcript, and people will be able to see what subjects are included as well. So what do you learn in the Bachelor of Business in the Accounting major, all business students will do two subjects called Accounting and Accountability, and Accounting, Business and Society. And a great thing that is differentiating UTS in our accounting subjects compared to any other university is that we are giving away free textbooks for Accounting and Accountability and Accounting, Business, and Society. So these textbooks are what we call open education resources. We've written and collated two textbooks that you don't need to buy, you get free access to them, you can read them online, or you can download them as a PDF and print them out yourself. So that's one thing, there's some reduction in textbook costs at UTS. And we're leading the way in accounting through these open education resources. And then you've got the accounting major, which you look at all these subject names, you think what does all this mean? Really, we focus on a couple of different areas. The first one is management accounting, which is accounting for inside businesses. And how do we, as accountants, inside a business, help a business make decisions about what to buy, what to sell, what suppliers to use, how to build contracts for employees, to motivate them to do well and evaluate their performance. So that's sort of the first area is management accounting. The second area is financial accounting. And financial accounting is really, how do I prepare accounting information for shareholders, for the government, for the public to see. So that's financial accounting. We also have some law subjects to make sure that we know how to start a company and all the legal requirements for starting companies, as well as the tax requirements. So if you're interested in tax, there's a great taxation law subject that students will often do to help them go down that path of becoming a tax advisor. And then we have assurance, which is the subject I teach, which is auditing the financial statements for publicly listed companies, their financial statements must be checked to make sure that management are telling the truth. So we teach you all about how to do that. That's a very popular career path. And then we have a capstone, which brings all of our accounting information together to say, how do we look at companies from the big picture? How do we give advice about analyzing businesses, so that investors can make good decisions. So even if you think I might be interested in marketing, but I really want, I'm a keen investor, then the accounting information or the accounting major can provide you with great information there. For those people who are keen on going into the extended major, then the extended major gives you choice to do any of these extra subjects. And if you want to be an accountant, be a CA or a CPA, this is a really great way to go. Because law and ethics for managers is something that you need to do as a subject to be able to progress into the CA and CPA programs. But then you can also do something like forensic accounting, which is fraud and financial crime, innovation and commercialization, which is about how do I start a business have an idea, and there's also the opportunity there to do an internship. So get some practical experience so that you can go out as a graduate and say, yeah, I've had some practical experience as an accountant. If you're doing the sub major, then you do obviously the core accounting subjects and you can choose four from any of these subjects around business analytics, processes, understanding businesses and governance. So this is aimed at using accounting as a small business owner, really in the Accounting in Practice sub-major. Some people might be here about the Bachelor of Accounting. This is our flagship Co- Op scholarship program, and it is hands down; according to employers; the best co-op Scholarship Program in the country. We have students apply from all over Australia and across the world, a lot of ex-pat students, Australian students studying in places like Singapore, Hong Kong, also apply for the Bachelor of Accounting. So it is our flagship program and we will get 1000's of applications that we whittle down to 35 students coming into the intake, so it's for high achieving students. On average, these students do have an ATAR above 90, whereas the Bachelor of Business, most recent selection rank was 86 for 2021. So most students in this program will have a selection rank of 90 or above and they're keen on taking a really strong focus in accounting. They want to be a chief financial officer, that type of role. So they have to do the Accounting major. So in terms of tailoring the Bachelor of Accounting, they must do the accounting major, plus either a second major, two sub-majors or sub-major and electives. So again, lots of students in the Bachelor of Accounting partner with finance, with marketing, some even choose to go on exchange by doing a sub-major, and then they save their electives for their exchange experience. Here's the typical structure for the Bachelor of Accounting students. You'll notice here they have this fast track situation in January where they start their program early. So the Bachelor of Accounting is really a four year program, that we squash into three years by them doing these extra summer courses, plus their internship. So when they're doing an internship, they are working full time, and also studying two subjects at the same time. There's also a $51,500 scholarship. Now, the scholarship money comes from our partners. So every single semester they or every single fortnight they get their university scholarship; that scholarship is tax free; as well as their internships. And that scholarship funding comes from our industry partners. So these are the places where you could do an internship with a Bachelor of Accounting places like Macquarie Bank, like the Woolworths Group, UTS, Coca Cola, one of the Bachelor of Accounting students from I think about 18 years ago, is Vice President of Finance and accounting at Coca Cola Amatil. So QBE insurance, Westpac, there's a whole range of different industries, depending on whether you might want to be a management accountant, or a financial accountant or even a specialist audit, or tax advisor. So there's lots of experience here that can be gained for the Bachelor of Accounting students. If you're thinking Well, how do I get experience as a Bachelor of Business student, then there's also options for internships in the Bachelor of Business. But for Bachelor of accounting, people are interested in that program, you need to do more than listed as your first preference through UAC, you have to have an application form plus an extensive interview process. So the Bachelor of Accounting is not eligible for the UTS Early Entry Program, it's run through a separate set of information, just search Bachelor of Accounting UTS in your search engine, it will take you to all of the information. And we have two rounds of applications. So if you're out there, and you're in year 11 now and you're keen on this particular area or this particular program, keep an eye out because applications for next year will open in May. For 2022 intake, we have a second round, open on; ah closing sorry, on the 15th of October. So you'll have to make sure that you get your application form in that will require the school to complete some information as well on that application form. So if you want more information, don't forget that you can download our UTS Business course guide as well - it has all of the information about the accounting major, as well as some of our other programs and other majors within UTS and the Bachelor of Accounting program. Now, does anybody have any questions they want to ask us about Accounting, you can type those into the Q&A. Or if you can't figure out how to get the Q&A box open, you can just type them in the chat as well. We'll be able to see those. I've been teaching here at UTS for almost 20 years, before that I was in industry at PriceWaterhouseCoopers for five years. A great question coming in how does Accounting differ from Finance? So finance is about the discipline of how do we spend the money where do I get the money from to be able to fund a new expansion. But accounting is really the recording of all of the business transactions and then analyzing that information. So accounting and finance actually go quite closely together. And it's our most popular combination. So probably close to 300 students, I think per year study accounting and finance together. And it is the most popular combination to get students into investment banking, managed funds, financial advice, as well as accounting. So accounting is slightly different in that we're interested in how do all these transactions get recorded? How do we know that they're accurate? Let's collate all that information. In finance, finance focuses on using the information that accounting outputs to make decisions about where do I get the money from? What about investing and looking at that share market perspective? If you're interested in futures, and you know, forward contracts, etc, that's more of that finance side, whereas accounting is more of that fundamentals of decision making component. There's a question about forensic accounting. And this is a growing area, especially with increases in financial crime. So forensic accounting is a little bit different from auditing. In that we have a hunch that something is going wrong in the business, we know that perhaps somebody has flagged potential theft, unusual money movements. So forensic accounting is about looking at all of the accounting and non-accounting data, to be able to identify financial crime and fraud. And that is usually done when the business suspects something and they will bring in a forensic accountant or financial crime specialist. We have forensic accountants working in the Police force, as well as in private industry through companies like KPMG, etc. that also specialize in in forensics and financial crime. And they use a lot of data analysis techniques as well because there are millions or billions of transactions at companies. And so therefore, to be able to comb through all of that they use a lot of data and analysis techniques as well. Now UTS asks whether we have an ACCA course. So UTS, because we are affiliated with Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; our accreditation with Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand also follows over to ACCA so we don't offer the professional studies for ACCA. But if you do the Bachelor of Business majoring in Accounting, and the law subject, or you study the Bachelor of Accounting, then those students will be eligible to sit the ACCA professional qualification exam process as well. So CA and ACCA work together here in Australia, whereas in other countries ACCA works separately. But here in Australia, they work with Chartered Accountants, pardon me. Make sure you stay connected with us at UTS, on Facebook and on Instagram. And the other thing as well, we don't have the Instagram for UTS, but you can follow us on Instagram @UTSengage. If you want to follow me on Instagram, where I talk a lot about sort of business accounting study at UTS as hints and tips. I've also put my Instagram handle there in the chat @amandalovestoaudit. Oh, I see one last question. If I wanted to go into banking; CBA, Macquarie etc, would either accounting or finance be good to get in. I understand internships and graduate programs are very helpful. If you want to go into banking, accounting and finance as a combination is your strongest chance in that particular industry. And most students who I know most of my alumni who are in that role, have done the accounting and finance component, especially for career advancement. It's the strongest combination of the two. But otherwise, a lot of students do go into those types of programs with a finance background. But there's lots of different roles. So if you wanted to go into lending and commercial management, then finance is probably the way you want to go. If you're looking at more of the management of CBA as a business, into funds management analysis, then that accounting and finance combination is really strong. Macquarie is probably one of the hardest places to get a job in terms of investment banking. So the other thing to think about is grades. So they're looking for really top grades because they've got the peak. They've got the their pick of the bunch at Macquarie as one of the top investment banks in the country. But to grade and also start from first year at thinking about developing your LinkedIn profile experience and internships. One last question that we're going to answer today is the accounting major recognized by CA and CPA, if you do the accounting major plus the law and ethics for managers subject, then we are CA and CPA accredited. And you will be able to start the CA and CPA programs. So thank you very much everyone. And of course, if you have any questions, you can contact us directly through Business through any of our social media channels or the live chat platform for the end of, for the rest of Open Day today, and also on Tuesday. So thank you very much everyone for being here. And I will chat to you all very soon. Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova 0:01 Hi everyone. Thank you for joining us today at UTS Open Day 2021. My name is Olena Stavrunova and I'm an Associate Professor in Economics here in UTS Business School. I also coordinate the Bachelor of Economics course. I'm joined today by Ben Robinson, who is currently studying Economics Honours after completing a Bachelor in Economics degree here in UTS, thank you for joining us here in the Open Day, Ben. Ben Robinson 0:29 No problem. Thanks very much for having me. I'm looking forward to it. Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova 0:33 Great. So, before we begin, I would like to say Acknowledgement of Country. I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation upon whose ancestral lands our city campus now stands. I would also like to pay respect to the Elders both past and present acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land. So before we talk about studying Economics here at UTS, let us recall what is economics. Economics is a very broad discipline. Basically, it is a social science, which takes a very rigorous approach to analyzing economic and social issues and phenomenon. In particular, economics focuses on two big questions. First, how individuals and societies decide how to allocate scarce resources to meet the needs and wants, and how economic incentives shape with economic behavior. And second big question of economics is what are the consequences of economic decisions for social welfare? And how can economic and social policies change economic behavior and welfare? Understanding economics is fundamental for making good business decisions, good government decisions, and for study of many social issues. So why should young school graduates like yourselves be interested in studying economics? Many reasons for that, I will only point out the most important ones. The first reason is that economics graduates are highly employable. Economics graduates have very diverse employment opportunities in industry and government. They also have great further education opportunities in tertiary education sector. What graduate recruitment programs in large organizations employ economists include including financial institutions, consultancies, government departments, and so on. Economists are valued for their analytical skills, their ability to work with data, and for a systematic approach, they take the understanding in a given issue or problem. Second reason is that economics is a very broad field of study, which has applications in many industries, not only the traditional ones, like banking, finance, consulting, but also health, education, urban development, and others. This means that you can pursue many passions and interests while studying economics. And that your potential career path after economics degree, can be very diverse, and can be chosen to suit your passions and interests. Ben, could you please share with us what attracted you to the economics degree initially? And what do you think are the best things about economics now that you have completed your bachelor's degree and are doing Honours in Economics? Ben Robinson 3:24 Yeah, sure. So when I say I think it's probably in the same position as a lot of the people in the webinar now where I was sort of in year 12. And I'd done a bit of Economics as part of high school. And I knew that I really enjoyed it. And I found it really fascinating as well. And it was something I was pretty good at. But I sort of didn't really know what I wanted to do after school. So I took a gap year after year 12 and then sort of throughout that gap year, I ended up reading a couple of economics books. And that really just sparked my interest. I was kind of hooked from that point in. And then I pretty much decided that was what I wanted to do for study. And then in terms of what I enjoy about economics; are now at the end of my degree is how, how easily that real life scenarios can be applied using the theory you use in, you learn in economics classrooms. A lot of the students here will see a lot of supply and demand graphs and that kind of stuff throughout their degree ; there really isn't a problem and a recession or an economic problem that can't be articulated using this very simple framework. So for me, my favorite thing about economics now, looking back on the past few years of my degree is just how applicable, the theory is to real life scenarios. Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova 4:46 Thanks, Ben. I agree. I agree with you, Economics is very applicable to everyday life. So like we said, economics is a very broad discipline that is applicable to a variety of economic and social issues. Here are example of some biggest economic and social challenges of our time. studying economics can help you understand and help propose solutions. One of the biggest economic challenges of modern times is growing economic inequality. Economic inequality is an inequible distribution of income, wealth and other economic opportunities between different groups of society. Economics can help you understand why inequality has been rising? What are the consequences of this for people in societies? So its being able to understand and evaluate different policy options for dealing with it. Climate change is another global challenge, which can be tackled with the knowledge of economics. Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is the key to reducing global warming. The main question is how governments across the world can create incentives for companies to reduce emissions. And we know that economics is all about incentives and how they affect behavior. So understanding of economics is crucial for being able to formulate effective policies for combating climate change. In fact, all policies that governments use to mitigate climate change are economic policies, including emissions trading scheme, carbon tax subsidies for firms and households and investing in green energy. Economy concepts such as demand supply externalities are central to understanding and formulating these policies. Gender wage gap is another important issue that economics have been working with for decades. Currently, in Australia, the gender pay gap is 13.4% among full time workers. What are the reasons behind this pay gap? Differences in job types and labour market characteristics between men and women can play a role. Labour market discrimination may also be a contributing factor. Economics has made massive advances in understanding gender wage gap, and you will understand this topic better better after studying economics. The current COVID crisis is another illustration of the importance of economics in dealing with global social challenges. COVID is a complex crisis affecting public health in economy profoundly. Economists have been heavily involved in debating about and formulating policy responses. Many policies people may have implemented during COVID times are founded in economics, for example, programs such as JobKeeper JobSeeker, an example of a fiscal policy that governments often implement to combat economic recessions. Such policies are very important for keeping the economy moving, for keeping people at work and preventing them from falling into poverty. So to understand and contribute to political debates during the COVID crisis, it is important to be well versed in economics. There will be many more exciting topics that you will learn about while studying economics here in UTS. So what do students learn as part of the economics degree? The students who have completed in economics degree are very much regarded as analytical thinkers. They tend to be professionals who are very skilled in working with data, they know how to approach a problem systematically, and how to take into account interplay between various factors. But they also learn about a variety of economic business and social issues where economic approach can provide effective solutions. Our subjects in the economics degrees here are very applied. Most of our subjects will include case studies, real life applications of analytical tools, that students learns throughout the degree, media, videos and so on. And as I was saying earlier, because it is such a general field, the skills that economists have are valued very broadly among a variety of industries, occupations, employers. So by now, hopefully, I have convinced you that studying economics is a good idea. So now let's talk about why it is a good idea to study Economics at UTS in particular. You should know that economics department here in UTS is a young department, but they have been consistently ranked among the top economics departments in Australia for research in economics. Taking an economics degree at UTS you will be learning from nationally and internationally recognized experts in this field. Secondly, not only we're great in research, we're also great at teaching economics. Our teachers are highly regarded as engaging and innovative educators. They tend to have high student evaluations and win teaching awards at the Business School and university levels. The advantage of studying economics at UTS is a geographic location UTS is 10 minutes from Central Station so it is easily accessible from all city suburbs also it is close to the CBD so it is convenient for students to combine their work and study. But importantly, the engagement opportunities with employers, that UTS has are fantastic. We have all sorts of things for students in terms of engagement, including alumni events, guest lectures, recruitment events, and so on. This stems not only from our geographic location, but also from concerted effort by the UTS Business School and Economics Department to build close links with industry. Ben, could you please tell us so you've completed the economics degree here in UTS? So what did you particularly enjoy about your study here? Ben Robinson 10:45 So for me, I think one of the biggest plus sides of economics at UTS is the quality of the lecturers and the academics. What I have found is that there's a real; so I've had some lecturers who have been in academia their whole careers, some who used to work in the public sector doing policy advice and other people who've come from the private sector. So you've got a lot of people with a lot of diverse backgrounds and those diverse backgrounds lead to diverse opinions, lots of different debates about different things in the classroom. It's just a really varied skill set and backgrounds. And that's just something that goes with you throughout the whole degree. And that's, that's brilliant. Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova 11:31 Thanks, Ben. Thanks. Thanks for your kind words. I appreciate it. Okay, so where can economics take you career wise? Economics alumni end up everywhere. They're particularly concentrated in the corporate world, such as financial institutions, banks, consultancies. Some of the biggest employers of our graduates are actually big Australian banks and consulting companies. But our graduates also work in other sectors such as insurance, logistics, energy, real estate, public sector and others. Why do not all of our alumni end up in public sector in places like Treasury, Reserve Bank, Department of Education, so on? As far as the roles economics graduates can be employed in a variety of roles, including economists, financial analysts, investment analyst, and any authors you see them listed here on this slide. So job title 'Economist' is only one among a variety of career path of an economics graduate. Okay, so what are your options are studying economics in UTS? There are two options for your study in Economics here at UTS. Bachelor of Business, and Bachelor of Economics. Bachelor of Business is a degree which provides you with a broad business education and includes an option of learning economics as part of your major, extended major or sub-major. Bachelor of Economics is a specialized degree developed in consultation with industry. The Bachelor of Economics, you can really specialize in economics, and also study in depth one or two other business disciplines as part of your major or sub-major. Let's talk about your economics study options in the Bachelor of Economics. You can study economics in this degree by selecting a major which has eight economic subjects, an extended major which has 12 economic subjects, or an economics or econometrics sub-majors, which have four subjects each. Bachelor of Business is a very flexible degree. Whichever economics option you choose, you can tailor your degree to suit your interests in other business fields. The Bachelor of Business degree has eight business compulsory core subjects here in the first year. This includes finance, economics, accounting, management, statistics, and marketing subjects. Starting from the second year, students will specialize in their chosen business disciplines by choosing majors, sub-majors and electives. You have three options to study Economics in the Bachelor of Business shown here. Option one includes Economics Major. With this option, you can then choose the second major in a different business discipline, or two sub-majors or a sub-major plus four elective subjects. We have a flexible set of eight elective subjects. Option two includes economics extended major. With this option, you can then choose a sub-major in another business discipline of four elective subjects. And finally, option three includes Economics sub-major, you can also have Econometrics sub-major. With this option, you can then choose all these different combinations listed here in this box. This slide shows economics subjects included in the Bachelor of Business Economics Major. In addition to two economics subjects that are part of the Business core Economics Major includes five compulsory economic subjects listed here, this subject that can equip you with the fundamental skills of economic analysis that essential for economists in a sector and role. Then you choose three subjects from a set of economics electives, listed here. But have a very wide choice of economics electives, you can tailor your choice to your interest in economics. In the Extended Economics Major, you will take 12 economics subjects. So this means that in addition to the two economic subjects from the Business core, there will be six compulsory economic subjects listed here, plus you choose six elective subjects from the same list as before. And this slide slide shows the structure of Economic sub-major. It includes four subjects that are selected from core and electives with the previous two options. So the second option to study Economics at UTS is the Bachelor of Economics degree. Let me briefly describe the structure of this degree. The Bachelor of Economics is a flexible degree in which you will be able to fully specialize in Economics by completing 11 core subjects, and three elective Economics subjects. You will also specialize in another Business discipline, such as Finance Marketing, Management by completing an eight subject major, which is option one here, or you can also learn about two business disciplines by completing two four subject sub-majors option two. Or you can learn about one additional business discipline by completing option three here, which includes one sub-major plus six electives. Please note that all these options one, two, and three, include electives, two electives here, two electives here, six electives here. You can use these electives to specialize even deeper in Economics, or in the business field of your major or sub-major or any other economics, sorry or any other business discipline that you're interested in. This slide here shows 11 core subjects in the Bachelor of Economics. These subjects provide you with a broad and deep economic analysis skill set that is in demand in industry and government. For example, we'll get an advanced training in data analysis through the sequence of three statistics in econometric subjects in the core. You can also extend this by choosing time series analysis is one of your electives. Starting from 2022, we included subject Behavioral Economics in the core of the Bachelor of Economics. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological, cognitive, emotional, and social factors affect economic decisions. Behavioural Economics approach is very popular in industry, government and UTS is a great place to study Behavioural Economics, because we have extensive academic expertise, and industry connections in this area. So another interesting subject that we have in the course is the Capstone subject called Economic Policy and Analysis. It is an integrative subject, where you learn to apply analytical and data modeling skills to the analysis of important real world economic and social issues and policies. Here's the list of Economic selective subjects available to the Bachelor of Economics students. Some of our most popular electives include Economics of the Environment, Economics of Monetary Policy and Central Banking, and Economics of Competition and Strategy. So Ben, could you please share what was your favorite economic subjects using your study at the Bachelor of Economics degree here in UTS? Ben Robinson 19:55 Well, it's tough to pick just one but for me, my absolute favorite was the Economics of Monetary Policy and Central Banking. I'm very sort of policy-focused. My the thesis that I'm doing in my honours year is very policy-driven. And that was basically that I did that in '18; it just sort of ticked every box for me. And that's run by Peter Docherty, who is just the most amazing lecturer his passion for the subject and for the content is infectious in a classroom like it's, it's unbelievable and Peter's actually one of my supervisors in my honours year as well. So it goes to pay that if you do have good relationships with some of your lecturers, and you get an opportunity to you sort of get on, well, you have a good rapport with some of your lecturers, later down the track, you might have an opportunity to actually work with and collaborate with some of these great people that UTS has. Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova 20:51 Thanks, Ben. Yeah, yeah, I know, Peter is a great, great educator. So this slide shows Majors and Sub-majors available in the Bachelor of Economics. And please take a few moments to look at this slide, we have a wide variety of majors and sub-majors that you can take as a part of your Bachelor of Economics, including Finance, Human Resources Management, IT Management, Marketing, and many others. So we almost reached the end of our presentation. And now I'm supposed to give you my top tip, you know, for you people considering studying Economics. So my top tip for you, is to follow your passions and your interests in choosing your degree. And once you make the choice and enroll in the university, less, please make a full use of everything the university has to offer. For example, our academics here in UTS, is the greatest resource that the university has. And if you're thinking of Economics, you should know that academics in Economics group here at UTS, are exceptional in their knowledge of economics, and in their willingness to engage with this students. They also have a lot of extracurricular activities in societies for students, for example, students economic society, that offer great opportunities for networking, and engagement. If you come to us, please take advantage of all these opportunities. The knowledge and connections you gain from these interactions will be available so he will be invaluable for your professional growth as an economist, and what will be your top team Ben, as a student? Ben Robinson 22:32 For me - if you're, if you think you've studied economics and you apply and you get in, before you start, I think it would be really helpful to do a bit of light research into economics, and find a guiding interest or a guiding principle that sort of has you hooked. It does, it could change throughout your degree, it doesn't necessarily have to be super specific, but when I started I knew that macro was for me. So that was sort of every and then I sort of became more interested in the policy side of things as I went along as well. And then that informed kind of how I saw all of the subjects I was doing. And when I had an opportunity to do an assignment, I could sort of give it, gear it towards a sort of policy-focus, I take that opportunity. So if you if you are study economics, UTS do a little bit of light research beforehand. And just to sort of find that guiding interest that could sort of take you through throughout your whole degree. Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova 23:33 Thanks, Ben. Great tip. I agree with you. So this concludes our presentation. If you want more information about Undergraduate Business courses here at UTS, please download our Business Undergraduate Course Guide for 2022. And now it's time for the Q&A. We're happy to answer your questions. Professor Sara Denize 23:57 Olena, I answered one last question for you. What degree do you think you should do if you wanted to be Australia's next best Treasurer? Associate Professor Olena Stavrunova 24:08 Oh, I think you should definitely do Economics degree. So I know that Australia, what is it; Shadow Treasurer? Yeah. So Andrew Leigh, of the Labour Party. So he's a very well known Economist. So he used to be an Academic Economist before he became a Politician and I think how he talks about things you know, you can clearly see that he's an Economist and it's of great help, his economics background to what he's doing right now as a Shadow Treasurer. Okay, so one question is how many people are enrolled in Bachelor of Economics? So, off top of my head, I don't remember the exact number but about every year would be every year we get about 100-120 incoming students. So graduate salary? Oh, that's an excellent question. I don't know the answer. I will be happy to provide the answer for you a bit later. So can you do Economics first and then enter into Law? How do we do this? So one way how you can do Economics in Law is actually do double degree Bachelor of Economics Bachelor of Laws, I think that's a five year degree. And you can enroll there and you can study single thing is Economics and Law. That would be one option. I hope that's a suitable option for you. But that degree has somewhat higher selection rank than Economics as in Bachelor of Economics alone. Thank you very much for coming to this presentation.

Thank you very much and good luck with your choices. Event Management Major 00:00 Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining us today where we'll be talking about the Event Management major within the Bachelor of Management here at UTS Business School. My name is Rachel and joining me is Dr. Najmeh Hassanli who coordinates the event management major within the Bachelor of Management. 00:18 Hi, everyone. My name is Najmeh and I am a senior lecturer at the business school. I teach both events and tourism subjects and I am the coordinator of the event management major within the Bachelor of management. 00:30 Now, first up, what exactly is event management? 00:35 Event management is all the logistical, promotional and strategic elements that go into developing an event, planning and hosting it and then assessing its various impacts. 00:46 And why should students study event management? 00:50 So events is a diverse and dynamic industry. It's all about creating memories and designing experiences for others. And because of this, it can be really fulfilling But it does require you to love challenges, be sociable, and a people person, be organized, have a bit of creativity and enjoy the satisfaction of senior projects through to completion. If someone has such qualities, then a career in events will never be dull for them. Second, events is still young as an industry, but it is well recognized. It is a growing profession that requires specific skills and qualities. Having a qualification is important to be able to work in an industry, but also to have a career progression in it. And finally, it is a billion dollar industry. The industry is vibrant, it contributes greatly to the economy. And just to give you an idea and put things in perspective, business events alone generated 23.1 billion total economic contributions and created about 180,000 direct jobs in Australia in just one year. 01:52 What are some of the skills and knowledge that students in this major will walk away with? 01:57 First, students gain a solid understanding of the sequential steps associated with the design, development, planning, and implementation of innovative events, and the professional skills associated with each of these steps. They will also learn about the promotion and marketing of events and how to gain sponsorship and financial support for events. Finally, we know that events don't exist in vacuum. They are defined by the political, social, economic and organizational context in which they exist. And so our students will develop a sound understanding of the context in which events take place. 02:33 If students are interested in event management, what are the options available to them? 02:38 So event management is a major under the Bachelor of Management, but if students are doing Bachelor of Business, and might be interested in doing events, they can actually choose to do events as a sub major as well. 02:51 What are the subjects that students will studying within this major? 02:55 Here you can see a list of different specialized subjects that our students do. These include introductory subjects such as event and entertainment context, event impacts and legacies, event management. Subjects that are normally taken in the second year include positioning and promoting events, events sponsorship and revenue. We also advise students to consider the professional internship subject in the second year, which takes them through to the final year. And finally our subjects include servicescape and venue, and event creation lab, which is the capstone subject. Our students really enjoy the subject as it enables them to put into practice the theoretical and practical knowledge they have acquired in all of the subjects they've studied throughout the Bachelor of Event Management. They basically come together, work in teams, to design, project manage, and implement an actual event. And the profit they make from putting on the event goes to a specific charity or cause. Some of the organizations that our students have previously supported and contributed to are Beyond Blue, Smile for Me, Dress for Success and Rough Sleepers. 04:05 So what are some of the career options on offer to students who study event management? 04:10 As a growing global industry, events offer a broad range of employment opportunities. Some of the Graduate positions include event coordinator, convention coordinator, and marketing assistant. The career progression options include Event Manager, entertainment venue or facility manager, convention planner, festival organizer, marketing manager and sponsorship manager. Our recent graduates have taken up a wide variety of employment opportunities, which reflects the breadth of the industry. And just to give you a few examples, Marie, one of our 2017 graduates was working as event coordinator at CBA in 2018. Chelsea, another one of our former graduates is currently the special event coordinator at the Sydney Opera House. 04:55 What would be your top tip for students interested in pursuing event management? 05:00 I always encourage students to get some work experience while this study. This is obviously possible through our internship subject, which students take in their second year. And we've received very positive feedback about students being able to apply a lot of the skills and knowledge and qualities that they've acquired throughout their degree into real work. But it is also possible through paid positions. And this is something that is not possible to all students, and we understand that, but in other ways through volunteering opportunities at various events, and we do encourage students to do volunteering and do volunteer at events and we do inform them of any opportunities that comes up. But one thing that I would like to say about volunteering is, while these opportunities may be helpful in getting your foot in the door, you need to also be critical about about them. Always ask yourself what is it that you will gain from experience and will it actually be adding something valuable to your skills? Remember, you're not just giving to the organization, you also need to gain from that experience, from that opportunity. So be critical, question that value and ensure that it is a purposeful opportunity for you. I would encourage you to keep an open mind, you may think that not all of what you come across and learn throughout your uni life, and life in general, is interesting or even relevant to what you may actually be considering doing. But that's the thing. The list of opportunities in this industry is endless. There are many different choices to make and directions to explore. And the more diverse your experiences, the more prepared you will be for your career in events. 06:36 Thank you so much for your time explaining the event management major. 06:40 Thank you. It's been a pleasure. I do hope information has been useful for our prospective students or potential students and I do hope to see many of them at UTS next year in our events major. Thank you. 06:55 Please feel free to explore out other videos detailing our courses and majors. If you have any questions, you can reach out to us via our social media channels, or contact us directly by phone on 95143074 or by email business@uts.edu.au. Thank you so much. Digital Creative Enterprise Major 00:00 Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining us today where we'll be talking about the digital creative enterprise major, or we call it DCE within the Bachelor of Management here at UTS Business School. My name is Rachel and joining me is Dr. Sumati Ahuja, who coordinates the DCE major within the Bachelor of Management. 00:19 My name is Sumati Ahuja. I am the subject coordinator for the new digital creative enterprise major. I'm also an architect, that's my background. And I have a PhD in management and I'm particularly interested in creative people in the business world. So how do you deploy creativity in the business world today. 00:48 Now, DCE is a relatively new major, what exactly is it? 00:54 Okay, so this is a very exciting major because it brings the two worlds that I'm very familiar with, which is design and business or design and management to be more specific, together. So it's a really great way for students to learn ways to improve the management of an organization's digital presence. And also learn to apply design thinking principles, which is really creative approaches to problem solving. One of the things that's really important to recognize is that we increasingly face very, very complex problems. For example, aging populations, for example, global warming, these complex solutions are not based on one organization or one answer. This really calls for collective action. And this is where creative thinking is very, very well positioned. Because it doesn't follow traditional approaches to solving problems and creative thinking and design thinking in particular recognizes that complex problems need a suite of expertise to answer those, and creatives are really well positioned in that field, because creativity relies very much on framing and reframing the problem across the stakeholder ecosystems. So when you work in multidisciplinary teams and the subject, for example, you realize how fundamental all the organization silos are, and how they need to come together. And in this particular course, we help you develop skills that allow you to talk across disciplines, by simple things like putting the user at the center of any problem framing that you do. So what's really great and what leverages creative thinking across organizations is that very focus on putting the user at the center of the ecology of the problem. 03:10 So why should students study a major in DCE at UTS? 03:16 The course itself is a very interesting course because it is designed to get students engaged in innovation in the digital economy. So it gives students an opportunity to align themselves with national and international endeavours that particularly reward innovation in the digital sector. Now, we will also be engaging very actively with industry, we have several industry partners that share their insights and pitch problems at students, which gives all of the students a chance to engage really actively with what's going on in the industry contexts at the moment, and apply your historic and contemporary understandings of governance in the creative industries sector. 04:10 What are some of the skills and knowledge that students that do a major in DCE will walk away with? 04:15 So this is a really great opportunity for students to learn about the creative industries. So that's one subject, and how important the creative industries are to our economy and to the global economy more broadly, and how that sector has really made major inroads into really pivotal parts of digitalized, globalized economies. Students will learn to work in multidisciplinary teams which is increasingly a mode in which most organizations want people to work in. We will also be talking a lot about creative approaches to solving complex problems across industries. So moving away from traditional management thinking into more creative, design thinking type approaches to solving complex problems. And one of the really key things about creative approaches and design thinking in particular, is to put the user or the customer at the center of the focus of the innovation. So students will learn how to critically appraise industry problems, as well as focus on the consumer, the customer, the user, as a way of innovating. 05:42 And what are the subjects that students will be studying in this major? 05:46 The major has a suite of subjects and in the first year, you will be doing 21662, which is creative industries in the collaborative economy. So this is a subject where you really learn about how broad the reach now is of the creative industries across, as I mentioned, digitalized and globalized economies. And there are subjects that cover risk management. And there are subjects that cover creative thinking. And there's a capstone subject, particularly that covers digital governance and strategy. So you get a suite of subjects that are user focused, and completely kind of rethink the way that businesses are designed. And then how do creative industries fit within the broader picture of our economy. 06:51 Now, as mentioned earlier, DCE is a newer major, so we don't actually have any graduates just yet, but What are some of the career options that students can expect if they do choose this as a major? 07:06 So I think really the scope of careers out of this subject is really, really broad. We have some very interesting industry partners that we work with. So we have IBM, who have a whole design sort of section and the leader of IBM design team in Asia Pacific is one of our key partners. So she and her team present industry problems. And you get to work with people from Deloitte and IBM, who will both be pitching their problems and mentoring students through some really interesting opportunities and options for students not just to go into traditional Creative Industries, but really to think very broadly about how almost every industry now, whether it's a bank or insurance, any traditional business even uses creativity. And so, to develop these skills is a really great way of positioning yourself in a global marketplace for creatives in all industries, regardless of whether they're creative, per se, or whether they're traditional sectors that employ creative people. So it's a really, really broad scope of employment. 08:33 And finally, what would be your top tip for a student considering coming and studying DCE? 08:39 So the top tip really is that this is a great opportunity for all the students to explore how to be a creative entrepreneur in our digital world. The key learnings are really how to be creative, so creativity is something that can be taught. And everybody can use that in different ways, as I've already mentioned, across very traditional sectors. So you can be an embedded creative in a non traditional sector or work as a creative in a creative industry. And the other great thing about this particular suite of subjects is that students learn the ways in which creativity gives an edge to any business. So you can really leverage your skills in whatever interests you write from startups through to enterprises like IBM and Deloitte. 09:36 Sumati, thank you so much for joining us and talking us through DCE. 09:40 It's been my pleasure. And I want to just conclude by saying that I really enjoy both teaching and researching this subject. It's very close to my heart, of course, coming from architecture, but also because I get to meet such a diverse cohort of students with so many different interests coming from so many different backgrounds, so it's a really great melting pot of ideas. And I really look forward to having some of you in my cohort very shortly. 10:10 Thank you everyone for tuning in. Please feel free to explore our other videos detailing our courses and majors. If you have any questions you can reach out to us via social media channels listed in front of you. Or you can contact us directly by phone on 95143074 or email business@uts.edu.au. Thanks again. Dr Scott Walker 0:00 Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us at the UTS Open Day 2021. My name is Scott Walker, as you can see from the title slide, and I'm in the Finance Discipline Group. So what I'll be talking to you today about the Finance majors specifically. First of all, it is very important that we make an Acknowledgement of Country. So I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation, upon whose ancestral lands our campus now stands. I would also like to pay my respects to the Elders both past, present and emerging and acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land. So, really, I guess you're here because you want to know, what is Finance? Well, because I'm going to explain to you about the Finance major, you want to know what Finance is, and really what finance is, it's all about managing money. A good example of this that many of you may be familiar with, is the issue with Lionel Messi, the football player who had to leave Barcelona, which is where it basically started his football career when he was 14 or 15. Why did Messi have to leave Barcelona? Because the club had financial difficulties. So what was happening was that basically Barcelona could not afford him. Because the revenues that the club was earning have been decimated because of the pandemic. So like any business, once their costs get to be larger than the income, then of course, you've got a what's called cash flow problem. And finance is all about cash flow. And if a company has cashflow difficulties, or even a football club like Barcelona, then of course they can't, they've got to manage those costs. And so of course, they had to let Messi go to ensure the long term survival of the club. Now, of course, to ensure the long term survival of the club that had to deal with that cashflow problem, and they did that by involving an investment bank. And this is a huge part of what finance is about, which is about getting some capital or money. So Barcelona needed some capital, they got the help of Goldman Sachs, to help borrow some money. And that will hopefully see Barcelona through the next probably eighteen or two years and they'll come out stronger on the other side. So really finance is; this is just one small example of what finance is all about just taking the case of a famous example, with Barcelona. And so we can talk about it more broadly. But in essence, it's about managing that money, managing that cash flow, to ensure a company's long term success. Of course, there are some incredibly successful companies in this world and in finance, we measure success by value, more specifically, stock market value. So for instance, we know out of these companies I've got listed here, well, we know that the most valuable company in the world is Apple, obviously, being an online event, I don't have that interaction with you. It's much more fun when we're face to face on the beautiful UTS campus, which you can see my background is Building 8, which is where I'm based, and many of your classes would also be held. And I would be telling you, asking you questions, you'd be sitting comfortably with free food and drinks at the campus on the if the Open Day was on campus. And I'd been asking you questions, and you'd be answering them and I'd be giving away free, free food, etc. Obviously, we lose that interactivity, which is fine. So for instance, we know Apple is the most valuable company in the world, it's worth more than $2 trillion (and that's measured in US dollars). In Finance we'll talk about okay, look, why is a company like Apple been so successful? How do they achieve that success and why they've been so rewarding for their shareholders who are the owners of the company. And everyone's always thinking of what's going to be the next Apple? Well, again, I can't tell you because either, in fact, I can't give you a recommendation because I don't have an Australian Financial Services license. So I'm not licensed to give investment advice. But of course, a large part of finance is trying to identify what makes a company successful. Everyone's always on the lookout for the next Apple. I mean Apple, for instance, is listed on the stock market, which of the stock markets is Apple listed on? Well it's definitely not the ASX; it is the NASDAQ. And Uber is another fairly successful company. Again, people are wondering, well is Uber going to be the next Apple? Is their price going to keep rising? I mean, Uber is on the New York Stock Exchange. So that's the Stock Exchange. NASDAQ is another US stock exchange. In Australia, we've mainly got the Australian Securities Exchange, which is where CSL and Airtasker, are listed, just two Australian companies I've picked. Obviously, CSL is in the news at the moment is in manufacturing vaccines. So a lot of finance is all about what's the role of finance in a company, whether it's a public company on a stock market like this, or whether it's the Barcelona Football Club, or even whether it's a government or government entity, they all need to manage their finances. And that's a large part of what a Finance major is all about. Obviously, UTS is not a stock market, that's just the UTS logo. So why come to us to study Finance or remember that we don't have a Bachelor of Finance degree? Sure, there's a Bachelor of Economics, Bachelor of Accounting, etc. But the Finance major is part of the Bachelor of Business. So if you choose a Finance major, you'll be taught by a team of people in the Finance group. And we're world recognized for our teaching, sorry, for our research areas, in particular things like ethics and sustainability, we've got a strong team, doing research in that area, but we've got a very strong team and well known people in the area of research in the banking industry, also corporate finance; so what are the finance decisions made by companies, both whether they are companies on the stock market or private companies. And also market microstructure, which is looking at the liquidity and how easy it is to buy and sell stocks in a stock market. Also got part of market microstructure, we've also got a very well regarded team of people looking at cryptocurrencies as well. And we've been successful very recently with one of our professors looking into digital finance and that's a big part of what our department does as well. We've also got very strong industry connections, and a lot of your classes in finance, we will bring in finance practitioners to talk about how certain financial activities are conducted in industry. So we've got a really strong link with a number of organizations, such as these listed here, and we'll often bring in guest speakers from these industries, just to show you potentially what kind of a career you'd be doing and the finance activities how it relates to what you're studying. Again, because of our location, is very useful as well being so close to the city. And we're close to a lot of entrepreneurial hubs and innovation hubs, as well. So again, as I said before, the Finance major is one of the majors that we offer as part of the Bachelor of Business. So remember the basic structure of the Bachelor of Business, there's the first year, which is a group of eight core subjects that everyone must do in the Bachelor of Business. And once you've had a taste of those eight subjects at the end of the first year, you'll then decide on what majors you want to choose. Now, hopefully, one of those will be the Finance major. So in the first year, there's one in the first year of eight core subjects there's one finance subject, there's a couple of accounting subjects, there's one or two management and marketing subjects. The one finance subject that everyone must do is called Fundamentals of Business Finance, that's a first year subject, and that's one that I teach along with a colleague of mine as well. In that subject, we show you the basic building blocks of finance, and hopefully based on that subject, you'll have a good taste, and you'll start to enjoy finance and you'll choose Finance as a major. The Finance major; the structure is there's five core subjects. So the first four of these subjects you would do in second year, so remember, in first year, everyone does the same. everyone comes into the Bachelor of Business doing the same eight subjects. They're the core subjects in the Bachelor of Business. Then, if you do a Finance major, then there's four subjects you'll do in second year, and then maybe you might do another major. So The Financial System is talking about the financial markets, the participants in the financial markets, financial metrics for decision making. You'll use financial data and analyze that data to make good financial decisions. Investment Analysis, you'll look at analyzing particular stocks, and then putting those stocks together in, for instance, a portfolio of shares. And that's the principle known as diversification. You do a bit more detail in Corporate Finance, which is again, looking at the finance decision within a company. Generally, all those decisions are made to increase the value of the company for the shareholders. And then the fifth core subject in the Finance major is a Capstone subject where you bring all of your knowledge together in one subject, right at the end of your Finance major. And then of course, there's three electives as well. So based on those subjects you've done here, you might get a flavor for, let's say, Commercial Bank Management, because you've done a little bit of banking in The Financial System. And you might choose to do that as one of your three electives. Maybe you might want to do a little bit more in Derivative Securities, which is looking at security, such as options or futures. So the five core subjects based on that, you then might choose one of these other three subjects to pursue. And again, you pick three, so all up is eight subjects in the Finance major. And again, the Finance major is one of the majors that you can choose as part of the Bachelor of Business. I really enjoy teaching it. I love the subject, particularly a first year subject where I get to really try to inspire you about finance and really generate an interest and show you why I love it so much and hopefully some of that enthusiasm will rub off on you. There's lots and lots of career paths in Finance; here's just an example of where some of our recent graduates have ended up at. But again, the best way to get a feel of what finance is all about is have a look at for instance seek.com.au, open up seek.com type in finance. And I just did it this morning. For instance, I saw there was a role for a Finance Trainee at Dreamworld. And one of the things that a Finance Trainee at Dreamworld would be doing would be analyzing the success of what's known as capital expenditure. So if Dreamworld perhaps builds a new ride, your job would be to analyze if that new ride is financially viable. And that's just one of the many many roles that are available in finance, just go to seek.com.au, you can have a look at that. There are other roles at Bundaberg Sugar. And even on that very first page, which you can look up yourself there was a financial analyst role at Alinta Energy. So there's a lot of different career paths for finance, it really depends on what interests you. But particularly once you've found something that interests you, then you'll be much more enthusiastic. And that is that is my top tip. Find something that interests you. Now we work really hard to make finance relevant and give it real world applicability. And hopefully that way you can see exactly what you're learning in the classroom is what a finance person would be doing as a career. So enjoy, embrace that embrace this subject. One thing I should make clear is that Finance, this is not a mathematical finance degree. It's finance as part of a business degree. So the finance, we teach you; sure there's numbers, but it's not mathematical finance. It's much more applied finance. It's very popular that people who enjoy their numbers to combine finance, with accounting, that is the most popular double major combination that people do as part of the Bachelor of Business. There are some overlaps between finance and accounting, but they are quite definitely separate fields. If you do want more information, there is the Business Undergraduate Course Guide for 2022. And you can obtain it from that web site (uts.edu.au/business-undergraduate-course-guide). Again, if you've got any questions put them into the chat, we can answer them here. Also, don't forget the general business UTS address one there business@uts.edu.au - there'll be people there who'll be able to answer your questions. So that's it from me. Hopefully giving you a flavor for what the Finance major is all about, again, there's not a Bachelor of Finance degree. Remember the Finance major is one of the majors that you can pursue as part of the Bachelor of Business. So thank you for your time it's a shame I can't see you in person and answer your questions face to face, but pop them into the chat and I'm happy to spend a bit of time now to answer any of your questions. So thank you for listening to me. Now it's my turn to listen to you. John Kennedy 15:22 Thanks Scott, I've been monitoring the questions, I just thought I'd read them out to you, and you can respond to them live. And so we've had a few questions today the first one? Would I choose finance as a major if I'm interested in share trading in the future? Dr Scott Walker 15:38 Oh, definitely, yeah, because potentially if you're interested in share trading, you would like to know the skills that will enable you to work out if you should buy a particular share. And again, we do that one of the subjects we do which is the Capstone, which is looking at models of share valuation, and valuing shares, and other assets, like bonds, that is a common theme throughout the entire finance major, so definitely yeah. John Kennedy 16:11 And then does UTS help open doorways, to be able to help and assist in finding a job while doing a business degree? Dr Scott Walker 16:19 Well, one of the one of the subjects you can do, I didn't mention it. But one of the subjects you can do as part of the Finance major is even an Internship. We will give you some help finding a company that you could do your Internship at. But essentially, many of the students as they get through, as they progress through the degree will meet for instance, guest speakers, and they might even have a word to the guest speaker and say, I'm interested in a role of an internship at your organization. Is that a possibility? So there is the internship subject, but also UTS has got a Career Service, where they will give you a lot of skills in preparing for post; preparing for employment after you graduate. So yeah, there's lots of support we will give you. John Kennedy 17:09 Yeah, and that Career Service as you've just said helps support in many ways. They run many events throughout the year, so you can engage with industry, and there are career evenings as well. And you can access them as much as you want. And, and if I was going to offer a top tip, that'd be something I would say is, you know, don't be afraid to keep going back to Careers, you know, your ideas may change, and what you want to do may change, and they can help guide you on how you might kind of navigate what you're thinking in for the future. Dr Scott Walker 17:36 Yeah, definitely. John Kennedy 17:38 Could you elaborate on finance being referred to as Applied Finance? Dr Scott Walker 17:42 Oh, okay. It's not, it's not theoretical finance. So when I say applied, a lot of the work you'll be doing is conceptual, and explaining certain financial activities. Sure, there is some underlying for instance calculations that you'll be doing. But a lot of it is being able to put that; put your financial analysis into words and explain to someone why you should choose a particular course of action, whether it's buying a share, whether it's; if Dreamworld should build a new ride, ultimately, what underlies a lot of the decisions that companies make is what's called a financial analysis. And a lot of those skills that you're learning is give you the ability to make good, what we call investment decisions, or if you like capital expenditure. So sure there's the underlying financial analysis, then a lot of it is applying it to the real world. And that's what I've said before is that we try to do a lot in our teaching in the Finance major, of really integrating real world finance in your learnings. John Kennedy 18:51 Great. And I know you've touched on this already, but how maths heavy is the major? Dr Scott Walker 18:56 It's not maths heavy. It's not. It's not mathematical finance .Definitely not. The maths that you need, we teach you as part of the subjects in the Finance major. So there's no assumed mathematics; there's no assumed level of mathematics for the Finance major. In fact, I think even to get into the Bachelor of Business, you just need to have done some maths. But yeah, do not by any means think; we teach you the maths that you need to know and it's not high level mathematics at all, by no means. Because we're trying to make we're trying to teach you very applied finance, and it's not mathematical, so it's not mathematical finance. It's much more applied. John Kennedy 19:46 And I get I think you've definitely touched on this in your presentation. But would a major in Finance and a major in Management work well? and just in general, what majors would complement Finance well? Dr Scott Walker 19:57 Yeah. The Finance and Accounting majors, they complement each other very well. And they are different. They are different. But there are some there are some similarities. But look a Bachelor, sorry, a Finance major with a Management major. That works as well, definitely. But it kind of depends on on you, if you're interested in finance, but management, you've got that ability to choose those two majors. And like I've always said, find something that interests you. There's nothing wrong with combining finance with management. But that may not complement each other, as well as let's say, finance and accounting. John Kennedy 19:57 We've just had another question through; how far can you take a Bachelor of Business? Can you then move on to your Masters for instance, in finance? Dr Scott Walker 20:52 Oh, most definitely. In fact we have a number of people that; a number of students that do the finance, sorry, do the Bachelor of Business with a Finance major, and then they will go on to do postgraduate study. So yeah, definitely. In fact UTS has even got recently, we introduced a Masters of Financial Planning. And we've had some students who've done the Bachelor of Business, and then decide; oh what am I going to do next, I might get into financial planning. And so they'll do a Masters in Financial Planning. Again, we've got a number of postgraduate offerings, but again, yeah. That's, that's all postgraduate information. And definitely, you can definitely, definitely take it as far as you want. John Kennedy 21:45 Yeah. And your thoughts on what you might want to do at a Masters level might change as you go through the Bachelor of Business. So just be aware that you know, you're not restricted in any way; there are multiple pathways and different Masters you can take once completing the Bachelor of Business. So it's very flexible in that way, opens a lot of opportunities for further study and career paths. I don't know the answer to this one; have the rules tighten about becoming a Financial Planner in Australia? Dr Scott Walker 22:15 Yeah, they have because the educational standards have been tightened because now they are; financial planners are required to have at least a Bachelors, sorry, have had postgraduate studies. So that's where a lot of the demand for our Masters in Financial Planning is coming from to meet those higher accreditation standards. Yeah, definitely. John Kennedy 22:40 Great. That's good to know. And then, as Scott mentioned, there is a Masters program so you can complete the Bachelors, and then move into that Financial Planning Masters degree afterwards to meet those new standards, if that's an area of a career that you're interested in. Dr Scott Walker 22:54 Exactly right. Scott, thank you very much for that it was very informative and everyone you can obviously remain in contact with the School we're here to help you as much as possible. Thank you for attending this session. Scott. Thank you very much, and I hope you all have a good day. Thank you everyone. And thank you John. Dr Helena Li 0:00 Hi everyone. And thank you for joining us today at UTS Open Day 2021. My name is Helena Li and I'm a lecturer here at UTS Business School. I'm teaching international business for undergraduate. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation on whose ancestral lands our city campus now stands. I would also like to pay respect to the Elders both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land. Let's get started. Why study international business? Of course, there are certain capabilities we try to build in this major. Before I reach into this point, let us look at some facts. I hope these facts can give you some basic understanding why international business is very important not just for individual, but also for the country. As you may aware, international trade and investment is critical to Australian economy, providing jobs and prosperity. In 2020 trade as a whole is equivalent to 45% of Australia's GDP, and is directly responsible for one in five Australian jobs. Until 2020, the total stocks of foreign direct investment is $4 trillion.What does this means? It means Australian company actually go abroad and invest lots of money in different foreign countries. At the same time, Australia continues to be a highly attractive destination for lots of multinationals. As you see in Australia, we have so many different multinational companies. In terms of our population, Australia has over 200 nationalities 7.6 million born overseas. What does this means? It means you will definitely work in the future with people from different cultural backgrounds, speaking different languages, you will deal issues, complex, and transnational. So in this major, you will learn how to communicate, collaborate effectively with people from diversified cultural backgrounds. You don't necessarily need to speak another language, but you will learn how to communicate with people effectively. So another reason to study international business is by looking at the gaps and opportunities in the Australian market. One of the biggest challenges our Australian Business facing is we do not have a strong track record of external collaboration. For example, according to a recent survey conducted by OECD, they said there is only 7.7% of Australian Business working with international firms. We are while they are doing innovating product products or process. And when we look at another picture from global 500 firms, and this we only found out four companies from Australia. As a global economy, this is not enough for sure. Australian business need more well educated talents with global mindsets and strong international skills. So to support our Australian business, to support um our economy, we need you to have international skills. So for this in this major, you will learn how to manage or work in an international firm. As you may know, managing or working in international firm is very different or far more complex than managing domestic firms. There are lots of challenges faced by our transnational managers such as culture shocks, miscommunications, or misunderstandings, which will inhibit a firm's success regardless of the size of the firm. So in this major, we will teach you how to analyze and how to solve all these transnational challenges. We will also teach you how our international managers making daily decisions, you will learn cases not from successful multinational firms, but also from unsuccessful ones. And this will be very relevant when you will be a decision maker in the future for an international firm. In addition to that, in this major, you will also have to solve lots of issues, social issues, confronted by our multinational firms. We will teach you how to develop your skills in understanding and managing social issues for international companies. So, therefore, in this major, we develop a set of skills that can help you to be competitive at global turnover, equip you with global mindset, and global outlook for your future career. So, you will learn some foundational knowledge, understanding differences across frameworks to analyze our transnational management issues. And you will also develop your interpersonal skills and open your eyes to look at the world broadly and openly. So, why study IB in UTS? First of all, in UTS, you will have a practical experience through our industry oriented projects, and guest lectures from different areas and in from multinational companies as well. For example, we had one of our guest lectures from a global consultant company, Essential, who is responsible for overseas mergers and acquisitions. In his guest lecture, he shared with our students his experience, and challenges when he was helping our Australian business to enter different overseas markets. So when I talk with IB students about IB major, what they mostly appreciate in the major is really this major happens to integrate what they have learned from other decent links or subjects, because everything has something to do with the global context. Furthermore, our cohort is by nature, very diverse, in terms of cultural background, in samplings and experiences, which is a great place for you to experience differences, broaden your eyes, and develop your communication skills. So what we have in this major, you will have six core subjects, Introduction to International Business, Introduction to Strategy, and then Transnational Management, and something to do with supply chain management, and marketing. After you study all these one, you will have a final subject which we'll call Capstone. In this Capstone, you don't need to learn something new, but what you do is, you integrate what you have learned from previous subject and put them into a very practice-oriented project. So in this Capstone subject, you will really experience what is needed from our reward. And you can practice what you have learned from the previous subject, plus the two subjects you can choose from. So, where it can take you? I will say you can, this major can make you ready to work in almost any industry. You will, you can work in the private sector, or government sector as well. And also if you want to work as a consultancy, this is always a good option that you because you have diverse knowledge of business in different countries, you can work something very related, for example, International Trade Administration, international marketing, or import/export or international banking. So, to wrap up, there are some key skills in this major, I think at the end of the major you will have key skills. For example, you are able to adapt yourself to different culture, you are more resilient and ready to deal with lots of uncertainties. And you are very open to diverse culture and respond and respect cultural differences. And you're also ready to solve complexities in the business, especially for our multinational firms. So the for the top tip, in studying international business, I will say, if you like cultural differences, or like traveling across different countries, or experiencing new things, you are ready to take this major. And you always be open to differences, respect culture, and be inclusive, always open to accept new things, and be innovative. Don't forget to download our Business undergraduate course guide you have more information. Thank you so much for listening. Now, I think it's about time for me to take some questions, feel free to ask any questions related to the major? Jess, you ask, can I do a Bachelor of International Business? Or is International Business as a major? We don't have a Bachelor of International Business, it's under Bachelor of Business okay. So, I would like you to do Bachelor of Business and you can select International Business as a major. Another one, how does this differ from a normal business course and will we be engaging with several transnational companies with an internship? I will say International Business will have a strong global, international focus. So, you will be very well connected with what you see from the other subject, but we will give you something beyond because we are not talking about doing business in one country. We are talking about the culture and the country differences across all the different scenarios. Okay, so yes, you will have opportunities and our UTS career hubs will help you to even find internship in transnational companies, because Australia has lots of transnational companies for us to look into. Yes, you can do a combined degree um you can do a Bachelor of Business and under this degree, you can select International Business as a major and you can do another degree based on your interests. Are the opportunities to travel abroad? Yes, you can, you can have different opportunities for UTS. You can apply for exchanges to another country. You also can try internships because I have students they work abroad as an internship. Okay. What is the ATAR required for these? It depends if you want to do a combined degree or you just want to do Bachelor of Business. What are the exchanges? It depends really, you can be every country because UTS has a very strong linkages with other universities across different countries. We have European countries, we have US, we have Asian countries. So it really depends on where you want to go. And what you want to do. How much math is involved, there is no math required for these subjects. So feel free to take it. Are there any subjects that assume? No, there is no no requirement for other knowledge. I think when you are taking this major, you will have something basic from the first year and this will give you enough time to develop some basic foundational knowledge and which will take you to some core subjects in International Business major. So don't worry about assumed knowledge. Can I do International Business major through Bachelor of Economics? Um, I think I'm not able to answer this question. Do you have any idea Samantha? Samantha - UTS Business School 14:49 I'm just checking up on that one now. Yeah, so within within the Bachelor of Economics the majors that you can do, are International Business Studies, International Management and International Studies. Dr Helena Li 15:07 Yeah, the International Business major is not under the Bachelor of Economics. Samantha - UTS Business School 15:14 No, unfortunately not yet. Dr Helena Li 15:16 So I would like to if you like this major, please do go with Business / Bachelor of Business. Samantha - UTS Business School 15:25 I will just note as well. You can do the Bachelor of Business but then a major in International Business and a major in Economics, if that's of interest to you. So you can do the double major. So there is still an opportunity there. Dr Helena Li 15:39 What percentage of people that do this course get a job with an international company in the first year? What do you mean in the first year, you mean the first year of your degree? Or the first year after you graduate? After graduation? Yeah, I do have when they reach to the capstone subject. I have lots of students, they already work in the international companies such as IBM and some consulting companies and even Commonwealth Bank. So I think it's very highly on its a very good subject because he can take you to lots of different positions and very good opportunity for you to to be in an industry you like as long as they have something to do with the global context. So I hope I answer your questions with my best knowledge. So if there is no questions, I think if you need any extra information, please do attend our other sessions. And also even you can talk to our academics and staff there as through one by one chat, and I hope you have a lovely afternoon. Dr Helena Liu 0:00 Hello everyone. Good morning. And thank you so much for taking a little bit of time out of your day to come along and listen to me share with you a little bit more detail about the Management and Human Resource Management majors of our Bachelor of Management degree at UTS Business School. My name is Dr. Helena Liu, I'm a senior lecturer in the Management Discipline Group. And specifically, I am one of the passionate lecturers in the human resource management team. So I'm really, really honored and excited to share with you a little bit more about what we do it and what you can expect as a student here. So let's get into it. So did you know that 20% of a CEOs, job content can be replaced with technology? Isn't that interesting? So now when we're looking at the future of work, and machine learning automation, artificial intelligence, we have to really think about the ways in which we could future proof our jobs. And so much of the work that's done in organizations today, can actually be replaced with technology. But do you know, the jobs that are most future proof; that won't be replaced with machine learning and AI, are the activities that require social and emotional reasoning; the sort of tasks that we human beings are very good at doing, and technology not so much. And these sorts of tasks involve creating and communicating a vision, right, so kind of coming up with a big picture of what we want for an organization and its people - 10, 20, 30 years down the line. Motivating people, right, tapping into hearts and minds and swaying your employees. Resolving conflict, the inevitable tensions that emerge when human beings work with people who think and behave differently to them, and really figuring out how to work with diversity, and also how to cooperate with people, how to discern yours, and others strengths and weaknesses, and synergizing those in order to produce beautiful work together. So all of these tasks, what they really have in common is that they are the foundation of management. And a Management degree at UTS is really designed to help you cultivate those human or the social emotional skills that cannot be replaced by technology in the future that we so vitally need in our organizations and societies. So why would you choose Management at UTS. When I was finishing off my HSC, UTS was my dream university. I ended up going to a university down the road, but I was really depressed about it, because I stepped into UTS and I could just feel the energy and the positive vibes all around this university. Right, we're one of the largest and most diverse groupings of Management academics in Australia. So you're going to meet lots of different lecturers throughout your degree, all of who take a different approach to management. So you're learning something as wide and nebulous as management from many, many different points of view. We also give you real engagement with industry, we're not about dry textbook theory here. And then you go out into the real business world and you think, have no idea what to do. But we give you opportunities for internships, and business practice, and even just real world business cases in the classroom, so that what you're learning is directly relevant and up to date, so that when you graduate and you step out into the workforce; if you're not there already, during your degree; you're able to immediately start applying what you learn in your lectures, right into your day to day business practices. There is also a lot of flexibility in our degrees to build your professional portfolio to industry projects and internships because we know the field out there is really, really competitive. And so we want to give you the best leg up into your professional career. So we're going to give you opportunities to do those internships, to have business placements, so that you can list real world business experience in your CV when you graduate. You get a wide choice of majors, sub majors and subjects. So you can really think of this as a delicious buffet table of subjects where you can pick and choose right if you're interested in events management, sports management, across a wide range; which I'll show you more on the next slide; but there's really any kind of interest you have, any passions you have, for the industry that you'd like to see yourself working in, for the kind of job you would really like to do for the next few years of your life. We're going to have subjects that are really tailor made so you get that taste of industry knowledge and experience. And something I'm intimately familiar with is that we're accredited by the Australian Human Resources Institute. Now for most of you, that might not mean anything. So really, in a nutshell, what that means is the biggest governing body of the Human, Australian Human Resource Institute, or AHRI, looks at our entire degree, our human resource management degree, and checks that we are closely aligned with all of the demands and interests of real world business practices. They check that we are engaging with industry professionals, with our business placements, so that we can assure that when you graduate from an HRM degree, you are ready and able to serve as an HR manager of any organization out there. So we've got the seal of approval from AHRI that you've done that. And when you graduate from an HRM degree at UTS, you can immediately be eligible to apply for AHRI professional member status, that then enters you into a tightly knit network of professionals to help again give you that leg up and the open door into future career and job placements. So the Management in the Bachelor of Business, what that looks like is that you'll do your majors, you'll choose your majors across Management, or you could do a Management extension, which are some other universities might call an Advanced Management major. So you add on four extra subjects, you could do a major in Human Resource Management, which is the area that I teach in. And that's the one that I will speak to more intimately about as our presentation goes on. Or you could pick an International Business major. And underneath that there are sub-majors, right. So you would you would be able to do four subjects in these streams. So you could do Management on top of Management, you might want to look into Management, Consulting, International Management, Event Management, Sports Management. So some of these really drill deep if you know there's a particular industry or field that you would really love to apply your knowledge to. So I see some questions are already starting to come in, which is wonderful. If it's okay with you, I'll just keep talking with the rest of this webinar and then at the end, I'll loop back around, I'll collect all your questions give you a chance to upvote the ones that you care about and we'll answer them all in one go. So management is so important to businesses, because not only is it one of the future proof parts of future businesses, but it's really at the heart of what drives an organization or department forward. It kind of pulls everything together. It's the glue that holds an organization together. Because organizations are fundamentally made up of people. So management is really the study and the organization of people. In your management major, you'll have six core subjects. So this is what everybody needs to learn from their first year. So you would be looking at an Introduction to Strategy, Understanding Organizations: Theory and Practice. And this really kind of draws deep into the philosophy and the science of organizations. You want to be learning about Global Operations and Supply Chain Management, right? This is constantly overlooked in organizations, but it's really at the core of what keeps organizations running successfully and smoothly. You'll also have a great subject where you will learn Management Skills. So this is like the communication, the psychological, the sociological skills, you need to be an effective and ethical manager. Speaking of ethics, what's really core to UTS and our values of social justice is you will have business ethics and sustainability by pressing social issues, being front and center in your degree. And then you will also have Management Casptone which comes at the end of your degree that wraps everything together and sort of gets you to build a portfolio of what you've learned all throughout the three years of your degree into one whole. And you get to choose any two of the following that really lights you on fire. So a lot of people love choosing the Business Internship because then that gives you the real world business placement and experience to go on your CV before you graduate. And previous students who have done that subject rave about it. So that's one of one that's very, very popular. But you could also choose to dive deep into Innovation and Entrepreneurship, maybe you don't want to work for someone else, maybe you want to be your own boss someday. So the Innovation and Entrepreneurship would be a great elective to choose to really understand what would that look like if you want to strike out on your own and start a startup. Or maybe you want to be a consultant. So Management Consulting would be a terrific subject to choose. So as I said, this is a delicious buffet table. And there's no right or wrong here. It's about just going with your passions. So taking a look at that, and really seeing what would really be aligned with your aspirations and dreams. So there's a lot to learn in Management. Overall, your degree builds you in your core management skill so you can be an effective manager anywhere you want. Maybe you want to run events and so you want to manage all the contractors and all the employees running around with you to pull off an incredible event. Maybe you want to do sports management; so how do you motivate the team of coaches? Maybe you want to design your own startup, as we talked about on the last slide. So how do you manage and motivate and inspire the people who are taking a risk and joining your company in the hopes that it will become the next amazing thing. So overall, there are many different levels in which we're learning management skills. So first, we learn Managing People, you learn how to manage individual people, you will learn the basics of psychology and social psychology to understand what motivates people, what inspires people. We'll learn about Designing Organizations. So you can think of that as learning to manage groups of people. So how do you take a look at a whole team, right? It could be a small, intimate team, or it could be a giant organization of 1000s. How do we manage that? And the differences, the distinctions that come up between managing an individual and managing a group. You also would look at Change Management organizations need to be adaptable and flexible, constantly pivoting. This COVID pandemic has shown that the organizations that survive are the agile, nimble companies that can look at what's happening, and quickly adapt to shift their offerings and their strategies. So Change Management will be the skills that help you become more adaptable as a manager. And of course, we've got Organizational Development, which is about how an organization learns from its past practices and maybe past mistakes in order to continually improve their practices. This degree can take you to many, many different places, the possibilities are endless. And it's not just about your immediate future, like what's the first job you're going to get; but also about the long term career advancements. So the most obvious choice is that people think, oh you know, I do a management degree so I can become a career manager as in 'I'll manage people for the rest of my career'. But I also want you to think a little bit beyond the box as well, because as long as you're going to be working with people, management is going to be vital to what you do. So think of this management career is giving you soft, transferable skills that you can apply to almost anything and everything. So in addition to being a career manager, you will also be able to advance in your profession. So maybe you think I don't necessarily know if I will become a manager or if I'll necessarily like being a people manager. But I'm pursuing maybe another degree in engineering, law, medicine and accounting. And in that sense, a Management major will help you develop the skills for how you can manage yourself and also manage the people around you to more effectively do your job. So it will be an asset to you, even if you're not thinking oh, I want to be a manager. It's also not just about working for a corporation, right in the private sector. Management skills can be applied to anything, all sectors. So if you know that you want to work in the public sector, if you want to work for government, or maybe you want to work for the third sector, NGO charities or philanthropic foundations, these management skills can be applied to a broad range of sectors. So think beyond the box if you're not thinking purely corporations; again management can really help you in whatever career and field you choose. So let me dive a little bit more deeply into the Human Resource Management major. And then we'll quickly wrap up this webinar. And I'll catch any questions that you have. So the core subjects is you'll be studying Introduction to Human Resource Management, Managing Strategic Performance, Strategic HRM, and Managing Employee Relations. So this is getting really much more deeply into the employee relations side. So Human Resource Management can take you in a range of places, and don't think it's only going to make you an HR Officer. So let me give you three case study examples from our former graduates. So this is Bianca. Bianca did a Bachelor of Business with us fairly recently graduated in 2014. So in 2013, before Bianca graduated, Bianca did her internship placement with a company called Zambrero. So in Zambrero, she worked as an HR Consultant purely in a placement during her degree. So when she graduated Zambrero was so impressed by her performance that they offered her a role as an HR Manager, right, that's the dream, you've got your foot in the door, they know, like and trust you. And then within a year because Bianca was so dedicated, so effective as an HR Manager, she was promoted to HR Director. Two years after that Bianca became General Manager. And as of 2018, Bianca became the CEO of Zambrero. So talk about a powerhouse career isn't that wild? There's also Jonathan. So Jonathan came to us have after having already done a Bachelor in Psychology, and then came in in did a Bachelors of Business with us in 2004. In 2005, Jonathan took that to the other side of the world, and became a recruitment adviser to a London based company called Logica. And then with this kind of international experience, was then able to find work in recruitment for IBM for four years. In 2011 ended up as the Australia and New Zealand recruitment lead within IBM, and then again, jumped to Commonwealth Bank, another huge corporation and became Head of Talent Acquisition, before eventually becoming the Head of Latin America Recruitment for Uber in 2017. So think of the HRM degree as also opening up the world to you, and letting you expose yourself to international management experience, so that you can hop all over the world, of course, once it's safe and sensible to do so after this pandemic. And finally, I want to introduce you to Arjun. So, Arjun did a Bachelor of Business with us in 2009 and also added a research degree on top of that with an Honours in Management. And what ended up happening was in 2009, Arjun left and did a student scholarship with the United Nations in Thailand, worked as a volunteer for a little while, and then eventually, in 2014, becoming a Diplomat for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. So this is an example where somebody took an HRM degree and everything that they learned, took the opportunities that opened up for them, and then decided to enter a career that's not in conventional HRM but it's applying the skills that they learned in HRM every single day. So, as I'm wrapping up my webinar, I want to leave you with a top tip for any of you considering studying Management or HRM. Put people first. I want you to pursue this degree, if you are passionate about working with people, if you truly care about people, and you'd love motivating them, cooperating with them and seeing them grow and flourish. So if you can take that passion for people into your degree, it will make you a better teammate, it will make you a better classmate and it will help you learn in collaboration with everybody else around you. And honestly, it will make your degrees so much more fun. If you need more info, there is a wealth of information on the website that I'm sure you've already seen. We are having a one on one chats via the Tawk platform. I've been in there all morning answering student questions. So if you wanted to know a little bit more, or just like speak with another student, or another lecturer about what you would like to do, and if this degree is right for you, you can have that chat with them there. Alright. So please stay connected with us. You can get in touch with us via phone via email via social media. And thank you so much for listening to me talk over these last 20 minutes. So I'm going to, as promised, open up the q&a and check in with all of you there. Okay, so what's the difference between a Bachelor of Business with a major in Management and the Bachelor of Management? Really, I think all this is coming down to is just the particular degree structure, you can, in fact, choose very much the same subjects. And that's still up to you to pick and choose what works for you. So the best thing to do there is just to take a look through the Handbook, and have a have a look at what makes sense to you. What allows you to balance the subjects that you want to do. From a perspective of being a graduate and having the opportunities and the accreditation and the qualifications to enter a career in Management there's no different. So it's up to you to take a look there. Okay, what is the ATAR needed to get in? It really depends on what Major you're doing. So all the majors have different ATARs attached to it, I also see that someone is answering your question in a little bit more depth via the text as well. So again, have a have a look on our website, we've got all the past ATARs so you can have a sense of what the ballpark figure is. But I really just encourage you, if you're really passionate about one of the majors to just apply, you never know. Does a Management degree allow a better chance of becoming a manager than doing a Business degree. Alternately, it really comes down to your real world business experience and career advancement beyond your degree. So it won't be that an organization will necessarily go, oh, you've done a management major, great, alright, we're going to make you a manager or you've only done a Bachelor of Business; no, not so much. So really, it's an everything that you learn in your degree will be the skills to help you. And certainly, the Management degree, allows much more detailed, comprehensive and robust training around the Management skills. So that really gives you a leg up and can help distinguish you from more broader Bachelor of Business graduates. But how you make your degrees completely up to you, so you need to demonstrate the leadership, the communication, the motivation, the cooperation skills, to really shine in your organization. And in the HRM and Management majors, we do everything in our power to help you get ready for that. If we wanted to do HR and another degree is that possible? Yes! All your degrees and your majors and some majors can be mixed and matched. That's one of the beautiful things about UTS is that we really give you a lot of a lot of power and control. So take a look through the Handbook, have a look at what you would like to maybe match your degree with. And, you know, really, it's about what your passions and aspirations are. And you can pick the different degrees to help you complement your skills and your knowledge to excel in that field. Thank you so much for spending time with me today and taking this time out of your busy schedule. Stay safe, and I really, really hope to meet some of you in my classroom. Associate Professor David Waller 0:04 Quiet at the back, I think I can hear a few people talking. There's plenty of seats down the front, if you...Oh sorry, I'm just getting into teacher mode. Hi, everyone, my name is David Waller, I am the Head of the Marketing Discipline Group at UTS. So I'm an Associate Professor here and I wanted to welcome you, and thank you for coming and joining this session on Marketing at UTS. I've been teaching, Marketing for for many years actually, I thought this morning that it's before, most of you were actually born that I'd started teaching marketing. I taught at Charles Sturt, at Newcastle and at UTS and like a number of UTS staff I have got industry experience as well as teaching experience. I teach in the Bachelor of Business, in the Masters, but I also teach in the Bachelor of Business Administration, which is an indigenous program. So before we go any further, I just like to to remind people that you're standing on indigenous land I'm at Guringai on the Northern Beaches at the moment, I'm not sure where where you are, but hopefully you know that the name of where you are. And also I'd like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation is ancestral lands UTS stands on. And also I'd like to pay respect for the Elders, past, present and also emerging and acknowledge them as the traditional custodians of knowledge of the land. And talking about the emerging at UTS we have a great program, where we're looking at subjects for for Indigenous students, but also looking at subjects where we learn more about indigenous knowledge and how it can be used in things like this so it's an exciting part about UTS. And UTS is an exciting place to study. But we're really here to talk about marketing. How many people know about marketing? It's interesting. I mean, we've all heard the term. We all sort of have heard people talk about marketing. But what is it? What do you think of when you think of marketing? What do you think of when you think of marketing? For some people, it's advertising. For some people, it's sales. For some people, I know this is wrong, it's being deceptive. Now, it's interesting in the; when we look at marketing, we find that out that marketing is a whole lot more than just this. But marketing is a whole range of different activities, different processes. And it does relate to advertising. When you see an advertisement; how many people have seen an advertisement, sometime in the last 20 years. One person has put their hand up. Thank you. Oh now three, four. Okay. You've seen a lot of advertising. And that's part of marketing but that's only one part. You're looking at sales looking at, say the retail store? Who's been to a retail store? Well, probably not that many. How many people have been to a retail store in the last 20 hours? Probably not that many...no one. It's such a changed world. But in that changed world, companies still have to market; still have to send a message to work out their product, have to think about their pricing and think about the distribution and plan the distribution; there's lots of things to do. And so it's sales = deception. Oh, and some people think oh, you know, marketing is bad; marketing is evil. Marketing is a lot about communication, but marketing for some organizations and for some people they've been in trouble, because they've been deceptive. And there's laws against it. But all those things, you'll get to hear in the course. All those things and more, because it's something that's also happening now, something that that is even you're being involved with at the moment, about aspects of marketing, because UTS is marketing itself. And we know that with open days and other universities, they're marketing themselves as well. So marketing is a really interesting, wonderful area but something that you can relate to. Now, when it comes to marketing, basic part of the basic idea we'll be learning about the marketing management process is you think that there's the broader society, broader society, the marketing environment. If you look at the marketing environment, there'll be things like political, economic, social, cultural, technological, environmental, and legal factors that can influence how you market your product. Now has there been anything say in the last 18 months that has affected how we market our products and services, in the marketplace? in the community? There's been big changes, there's been massive changes. And that's part of also the discussion that we'll be looking at, because those things in that marketing environment affect how you market your product. And for a marketing manager, they've got to look at those uncontrollable factors, things they can't control, and then set out objectives. What are the main objectives? What do we want? We want sales, do we want awareness? It's not all about sales, but for a lot of non-profits and charities, it's marketing. So looking at setting objectives, and then determining the target market. Now, when we're looking at the broader marketplace, it's a big marketplace. But companies can't try and be everything to everyone. So what they do is they segment the market into smaller marketing groupings or segments. And target particular ones as part of their campaign. And position themselves, how they're perceived in the marketplace, compared to their competitors; segment target position; very important part of learning about the target market. And then setting the marketing mix. How many people here are doing business studies? a couple of hands raised. Okay, I'll get you to do the rest of the no I won't get you to do the rest. Oh all the hands going down when I asked that...but you might know the marketing mix, the marketing mix of a controllable factors, marketing environment, things you can't control, things you can control, in the marketing mix. And one of those were the four P's product, price place promotion, but also for services you can see that there's seven P's product, price place promotion, people, process and physical evidence, I mean physical evidence. And so looking at what's happening in with those controllable factors, and planning them, strategically planning them and aiming at the target market is your marketing strategy. And what you do with your marketing strategy, you implement, evaluate and control. Implement - just get the right product at the right price of the place and to people with the right communication. Evaluate - what do you evaluate against your objectives? Are we doing what we said we'd be planning to do? And Control - are we achieving those objectives? Or is there something happening? Or should we take corrective action? Or things to remember for the next time? So that's the basic marketing management process, but what's central to marketing? I know marketing has changed a lot. But what's central to marketing is the customer. And with the customer working in marketing, it's so important to know about your customer; to understand about your customer. Can anyone think of an example of who a customer is? What's an example of a customer? For many companies, it's you. There's lots of companies that would absolutely love you to know their brand, love you to have a favorable attitude towards their brand. Would love you to actually buy their brand and tell people that it's a good brand. So you're part of this process. And that's something that's really great about marketing is that you can relate to it. But to know about customers is so important know who they are, where they work, where they play, what they watch, what they read, their needs, wants and preferences, because marketing is satisfying the needs and wants to be customers. It's the basic idea of marketing - satisfying the needs and wants of customers. And we'll be learning in the subject how to do that, more about understanding what it actually means, in a broader sense when it comes to marketing. As I said, it's an exciting, and it's a fun area. So the next step I suppose is to look at what we do in marketing at UTS. Now, if you've, you've done the Bachelor of Business information presentation, you'd know that there's majors, and majors are eight subjects. And you've got to do at least one major when you do your degree. In Marketing, we offer two majors, as part of the Bachelor of Business is Marketing, which is more general marketing subject. And then a major, and there's the Advertising and Marketing Communications Major, I'll be talking about those in a minute. But they have some similar subjects, but Marketing, more general Advertising and Marketing Communications, focusing more on the P's, promotion, and looking at the different types of media that you do, and that's sending a message to the marketplace. There's also if you're really like marketing an extended major you can do which is 12 subjects. But there's also a number of sub-majors, which are four subjects. And you mightn't be interested in marketing as your your main major. But if you do finance, if you do accounting, if you do management, you might want to do either a double major; major with marketing or a sub-major, sub-major like Strategic Marketing, Advanced Advertising, Business Analytics. And having that combination of say accounting and marketing is actually highly prized when it comes to businesses, because they want people to know about marketing. And to understand the customer, they also want to do it within the budget. So having that combination is actually quite helpful. If you're also really keen when you're doing your Bachelor of Business, you can do one extra year and be the Honours in Marketing. We've had a number of great honours students. I've supervised a couple of honours students to completion. And Honours is where you you do a major research project by yourself. Again, to be a really interesting program to be part of. We're looking at the subjects in the two majors. First of all, the Marketing one what what's marketing, satisfying needs and wants of who consumer satisfying needs and wants. And so it's important, I said, central to marketing is the customer and knowing the customer behavior, extremely important. How do you know about the customer's behavior? Well one way is through marketing research. And so looking at marketing research and ways of getting information to a decision making very important. Integrated marketing communications; the area that I'm involved with; is the promotion part of the four P's and sending a message and integrating integrating different types of media to get the right message and a clear message to the marketplace. Got to think of when you're looking at your controllable factors to aim them at a target audience. That's your marketing strategy to do it in a strategic way. So Marketing Planning and Strategy is part of the core. And then at the end, there's a Applied Project or Capstone. And the Capstone is where you have a particular company as your client, and you do a research project for them. Exciting area. Some of the electives, just quickly, branding, branding is a fairly new subject, and it's quite a popular one. Business Internship. For some people, if you can get an internship in a company and doing the assignments, you can actually have that credit to you as a as a subject. There's more information available about that. But that's an exciting part of the UTS BBus degree. Digital Marketing and Social Media, Entrepreneurial Marketing, all sorts of exciting subjects that are part of the Marketing Major. As part of the Advertising and Marketing Communications Major we have some of those same core subjects; Consumer Behavior, IMC, Research, Media Planning, how are you going to plan all your media activities? What's the best way of doing them? Advertising Research, what activities that you can do to to clearly find out if your advertising is achieving the objectives? And this has the Capstone to. Also these subjects like Advertising Practice and Advertising Strategies which are from FASS, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Social Sciences, and their Communication program. And so that you can if you want, choose electives from the Communication program. Why study in Marketing, Marketing at UTS? Because it's the best subject, at the best university ever! (Is that convincing enough? Wave to me if it's convincing - one person, thank you). It's industry connections. We've got we see the Capstone, Capstone, we've had Revlon, Sandhurst Fine Foods, we've had Microsoft, Lion Nathan, we've had Ferrero Rocher. We've had the Darling Harbour precinct. We've had a number of different organizations as partners for our subjects. And also other subjects, like Pricing has actually been involved in connecting with some non-profit organizations and had projects done, done with them. We've got industry experts who do lectures, some industry experts, we've actually got some tutors who have got great experience in in marketing. And they're actually tutoring because they want to give back to the, to the university and to marketing generally. Those collaborations that we've had, and also marketing professionals are on our Advisory Board. And we mentioned branding. Branding was a subject that actually came up through their Advisory Board and they said, this is a good area; a good way to go. We've got a world class Academic team - me! Has that convinced you? No? okay, one person, thank you. But we've got some great lecturers and tutors, our staff are wonderful. We've got, we're about the only place that has all the four P's as a subject because we include pricing, we've got an advertising and marketing major, we've got an extended major. For looking at things like careers. There's lots of different careers in in the area of product brand in relating to advertising, global marketing, consulting, distribution, Marketing Manager, even CEO. I read one study that said, a lot of the main managers and CEOs have had marketing experience because they know about the customer and they know about the business. And so it's really important to have that. Look at some of the career paths. One of my former students students Renea -Campaign Palace which is an advertising agency, then American Express and involved with American Express and now EFTPOS Australia. An important job. Maile. She's one of the stars from alumni and she's worked with Procter and Gamble, and was Head of Procter and Gamble, Managing Director and then went to Google. And now Head of Digital at ANZ. She sometimes does guest lectures. And it'd be fantastic for you to hear and to be in a room with with Maile. The top tip. My top tip, If you do not study you shall not pass...Oh, that didn't sound that good did it? Sorry about that. But it's a great subject. It's a great topic. It's a great area. It's wonderful to work in it. But it's not just given to you. You've got to study, you've got to work hard. And there's a lot of theory, a lot of ideas and concepts. And if you can put it together. It's a fantastic way to go. And that's why I think that with Snoopy, here Snoopy's studying, studying, studying, studying, studying but then he can graduate. And it'd be lovely to see you all graduate at UTS. And I think it's all closed down at the moment but it's important to, to see that there is hope that things are going to open up things are going to be better and it's going to be terrific to to see you are graduating, once you finish the degree. But make sure that you study and also make sure that you look around you. What's happening in in the news, in the papers, online, do your homework, watch more TV and listen to more radio, get different ideas about what's happening. And those ideas enhances the marketing imagination. If you want more information. There's the Undergraduate Course Guide, really helpful gives you information about all the Majors about the course. And stay connected. And I think that's one of the main things. If you've got any problems, talk to your tutor, to talk to your lecturer. Keep in communication with people at UTS, we don't want people to fall behind the cracks if there's any problems. But I hope you enjoyed the presentation that I gave. And I know it's a difficult time at the moment but as things open up, we can then look forward to what's happening in the future and look forward to working in the marketing area. Sport Business Major 00:00 Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining us today where we'll be talking about the sport business major within the Bachelor of Management here at UTS Business School. My name is Rachel and joining me is Dr. Adam Cohen, who coordinates the sport business major. 00:14 Thank you for the introduction, Rachel. Just to briefly introduce myself to those that are listening, who can probably tell that I don't have an Australian accent. I was born and raised in the Boston area in the northeast of United States. Those of you that take classes with me, you're going to hear a lot about Boston sports, whether it's the Celtics or the Patriots, so some of you might love it, some of you might get sick of it pretty quickly. Um, I went to pursue my PhD in sport management about 10 years ago at this point. I received my PhD in 2012 and taught in the sport management department at Texas Tech University for four years and then this opportunity at UTS came up. And I think it's one of the biggest endorsements of the program that I literally packed up and moved halfway around the world, thousands and thousands of kilometers because I wanted to be a part of the sport business program here and the sporting culture here in Australia and look forward to talk more about the program. 01:20 What exactly is sport business? 01:22 Basically, the way that I like to describe it, it's for those that want to get involved with the management side of the sport industry. So this can be a broad scope of things for those that want to work in sales or in marketing or in the outreach side, and this can involve the biggest organizations in the world such as the Olympics, and it trickles all the way down to the local community levels of after school programs or grassroots sporting initiatives in the middle of nowhere. So when you hear the word sport business, it's just as all encompassing term for individuals that want to get involved with management side of sport. 02:11 UTS also offers a Bachelor of Sport and Exercise Management. What's the difference between these two courses? 02:18 Basically, the way I describe it is, those are the more sciency folks. And they're the ones that are taking, that are taking classes that might focus more on physical therapy, or gyms or fitness initiatives in general. So there's still management components, but they're still going to look at things such as kinesiology and fast twitch muscles and while the sport business, we're focusing more on management such as, as I mentioned, marketing, sales, outreach, etc. 02:56 Why should students study a major in sport business? 02:59 That's a great question. And as I mentioned in my intro, I think I'm one of the best endorsements that, you know, I literally moved here because I wanted to be part of the sporting culture and one of the greatest sports cities in the world. If you want to get involved with sport in the city, you have almost unlimited options, from many professional teams, from huge stadiums to large scale events. And we just heard the announcement about the Women's World Cup that is coming in a few years, obviously hosted Olympics and other major events such as the X Games and Invictus Games, and there's always so many different types of opportunities. Our major hope, you know, aims to set you up to succeed in one of those pathways to get involved and again, it could be maybe your dream is to work for the Roosters or to work at the SCG or maybe you care about youth sport initiatives or the nonprofit side of the sporting industry. So we hope that a major in our department can help set you up for that success. 04:10 What are some of the skills and knowledge that students in this major will walk away with? 04:15 Yeah, there's a lot of key skills. And I emphasize these in all my classes. And there's key skills based on specific things you're going to learn such as you're going to become a better writer, you're going to become a better public speaker, you're going to be able to learn to apply research and apply theory. And this is going to be more sociological type of skills that I always emphasize that we hope that you're going to become better at networking. And you're going to be become more comfortable going through an interview process because of your public speaking and your ability to be a critical thinker. And you're going to learn specifics such as you're going to learn marketing strategies, you're going to learn social media techniques, you're gonna learn sales procedures, and all these really specific skills that we hope words set you up for success with your career. 05:19 If students are interested in studying sport business at UTS, what are some of the options available to them? 05:25 You know, we'd love as many people as possible to join us, you know, have it be their primary major, and we think it would be a great direction to go. But one of the nice things here at UTS is many students also use sport as a sub major. So it gets a little confusing because if you take a class, or if you want it to be your sub major, it's called sport management, while the major itself is called sport business, but it's the same thing. Basically what a lot of students that they take it as a sub major, because it goes hand in hand really nicely with some other majors that we have such as tourism, sport and tourism has a lot of synergy. Event management, I have a lot of event management students that want to work in the event space such as the Olympics or such as the World Cup. And, you know, many other majors, sport is this nice kind of secondary option that, for students that want to go down that pathway, 06:32 And what are the subjects that students will be studying in the major? 06:36 Yeah, so our subjects are interesting because it's a mix of really hands on type of opportunities, and more learning sociological type classes. So we have classes, as I've mentioned a few times, that will focus on marketing, focus on management and leadership. And then we'll look at the bigger picture of sport. My passion is more of the impact. So how does sport influence society. How is sport important for gender equality and diversity initiatives which are obviously huge in the current climate. How does sport influence global relations. And then, finally, after you, most of you, when you get to your third year, you'll take a capstone class, which is where we try to apply a lot of the lessons you've learned into some type of practice where we'll align with a local organization. And we'll do some kind of case studies or we'll do some kind of campaign pitch for them or a PR program. We'll try to do something where you're really hands on and communicating and working directly with practitioners in the field. 07:52 What are some of the career options available for students who pursue this major? 07:57 Yeah, when it comes to career options it's interesting because sport business, it really is wide and diverse. So we'll have some students that they'll go straight to sales and they'll work in the sales department for the next 20, 30 years. And we'll have some students that are in charge of organizing and running events, students that are involved with the marketing and social media. You know, we have students that get involved on the media side of things and communication and public relations. So there definitely is not a specific job that students are going to end up with you. We try to guide you and help you out through the process and you know, that can turn into what type of internships you pursue, or what type of projects you work on, which all depends on where your true interests lie in the end. 09:00 What would be your top tip to students thinking about pursuing a major in sport business? 09:05 Yeah, this is a good question. And I emphasize this every year to my students that I'll be the first to say it's a very competitive field. It's not a secret that if your dream job is to work for the Olympics, or work for the Roosters, or work for a major team, then you're going to run into competition. And you're going to be in that pile of many, many CV's. So I always say from from day one, you have to think about how you're going to get your CV into that shortlist, how you're going to get yourself into that room to be interviewed. And top tips are, you know, from the very beginning, just put in a good effort. You know, don't try to skate by, don't try to just get credits. Don't just try to pass the classes, try to stand out. Take advantage of the opportunities that the faculty members such as myself offer, the opportunities that UTS offers in terms of networking and extracurricular activities, take advantage of opportunities to volunteer, and to go above and beyond. And, you know, take those opportunities to work on skills outside of the classroom, such as your networking, such as your public speaking and your interpersonal skills, you know, how are you going to get people in the field to know who you are, and to want to hire you? Yeah, in summary, I just want to emphasize that it's a really exciting and interesting time to want to get involved in sport, because you know, we do. There have been the jobs that have been around forever. And we all know the major professional teams and we all know the big events, but there's been a lot of interesting growth in terms of women's sports. For example, we've had the rise of the AFLW and the rise of women's cricket. You know, women's cricket has exploded in recent years. Community sport, you know, Sydney has invested a lot of money into grassroots operations and parks and rec and youth sport developments. So even if you know your dream is to get involved with the NRL or AFL, just realize that the field is much bigger than that and the opportunities are potentially much bigger than that. One last thing I want to emphasize is with the current events that are going on, and I know the perception is that sports are kind of screwed right now. We see the empty stadiums, we see some of the financial concerns. And look, I want sport to come back as much as anybody. And again, I'm a glass half full person. And I see the opportunity versus the disaster that's going on. And I've talked to people in these organizations and you could see that they're all, they're all planning for 2021, 2022 and their big comeback seasons and sports isn't going away. Australia loves sports. Sydney loves sports, these teams, eventually are going, they're gonna make their comeback. And, you know, in a perfect world, it's gonna be bigger and better than ever because people are gonna be really excited to go back to normal, to normalcy. People are gonna be really excited to go back to doing events and to watch and to buying tickets and enjoying life sport. So, while it seems like it's a ghost town right now, when it comes to sport, I think the opportunity in the next few years for the comeback is going to be really interesting. 12:29 Adam, thank you so much for your time and talking us through sport business. 12:33 Thank you for having me, and happy to any students that have questions, feel free to reach out. 12:40 Thank you everyone for tuning in.

A UTS Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences information session, featuring Branden Barber, Christina Miebach, Kamala Dash, Sian Hamilton. Hi, everyone we'll get started. So I'd like to first acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation upon whose ancestral lands the UTS city campus now stands. I pay respect to the Elders both past and present acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land and as people of great ingenuity and innovation. Hi, and welcome to today's panel Careers in a Green Economy. My name is Dr. Kristine Aquino, and I'm the coordinator of the Bachelor of Sustainability and Environment at UTS, a degree we launched this year that trains students in the environmental, economic, social, and cultural dimensions of sustainability and equips them with skills in tackling sustainability issues across different sectors and industry. Sustainability is one of the biggest global issues of our time. And as such work in sustainability is growing across all sectors around the world. So this degree can be combined with the Bachelor of Business, Bachelor of Management, Bachelor of Economics, Bachelor of Science, or the Bachelor of Health Science. And it only adds one extra year to the study in these degrees. So a total of four years of full-time study, for example. So it equips students with skills in a range of skills in data literacy, program evaluation, systems analysis, critical and creative inquiry, community engagement, collaborative teamwork, project management, and many others. So it's unique in this interdisciplinary structure. It's the first combined degree offered in Australia for sustainability studies at the undergraduate level. So it adds specialist knowledge on environmental and economic and social sustainability to the partner degree, giving graduates an added edge in the job market. So our program is also committed, especially to providing students with local and international industry engagement and experience throughout the degree, making them job-ready once they graduate. And this panel today highlights the value we place on industry engagement and insight here at UTS, we have four panelists with us to discuss the growing career pathways in sustainability or in the government, NGO and business sectors and including in the Asian region. So before I introduce the panel, just some quick housekeeping, so please put all your questions in the Q&A box, and as well this webinar is being recorded and will be available to view, and you can contact us for further information after this panel. So I want to kick off the panel by introducing our panel members. We have with us, Branden Barber, CEO of Rainforest Rescue, a global not-for-profit partnering with government agencies, NGOs and businesses to save and restore Australian and international rainforest. Starting with a degree in environmental studies from UC Santa Cruz, he cut his seated Greenpeace international on the rainbow warrior and then ran the Victorian state office for Greenpeace Australia. Over the past 25 years, he's worked in both the social profit and for profit sectors from startups to S&P 500 companies to NGOs large and small. He is an organizational engagement and development professional supporting and driving environmental and social justice initiatives. He's joined by Christina, my back a multi-skilled marketing and communications professional with over 12 years of experience, working with corporate market leaders, as well as small and medium sized entities on an international scale, including her own startup business, Indie & Isaac, which is a sustainable kids' clothing brand that aims at combating fast fashion, which sustainably sourced and ethically manufactured wardrobe staples. And we also have Kamala Dash and assistant professor in public policy and management at Sri Sri University in India and director of the university's climate change and sustainability center. He has been trained in climate change education from the Nobel Laureate algos, the climate reality project in the US in the office and has conducted several training programs in areas of environment, communication, public policy, higher education, and sustainability and rounding off the panel. We have a current bachelor of sustainability and environment, student Sian Hamilton currently taking the degree with Bachelor of Business. She was also working at the UTS Institute of Sustainable Futures, an administrative assistant. Sian is enjoying exploring the sustainability field while being introduced to people with a variety of passions. She uncovers areas of interests. So our panel is facilitated by my colleague, professor, Kate Barclay from the School of International Studies and Education, and who is also one of the teaching stuff in the degree, along with myself, she's a leading social scientist researching in the social aspects of fisheries at a time when industry and government are increasingly recognizing the importance of the human dimensions in sustainable fisheries. So welcome everyone. And thank you for your time today, and I'll hand it over to you, Kate. Thanks, Kristine. I'd like to kick it off with Branden first. Could you in about three minutes, give us an overview of your jobs that you do now, as well as a brief history of your own career history and what led you to having a career in the green economy? Sure. Hi, everyone. So I'm the CEO of Rainforest Rescue and Rainforest Rescue is in the business of primarily we've shifted our focus to be less broad and really honed in on the Daintree Rainforest in far north Queensland, which is the most ancient of rainforests in Australia's largest and most biodiverse. I originally thought I was going to be a psychologist like my dad. And while I was at UC Santa Cruz as a freshman, I was just falling asleep. I was in my dorm room, which I shared with Ted and as I was falling asleep, I sat up right. And I said out loud, the planet I have to help the planet and Ted said, shut up, go back to sleep. And the next day I changed my major and became an environmental studies student. And my first job out of uni was with Greenpeace. And as you heard, I, I ran the Greenpeace office in Victoria and then I wound up developing Greenpeace's first website, which was someone had to do it. And it was the new thing back then. And then I took some time to play in the whole sort of new media world and learned a lot about brand strategy and marketing and wound up jumping back into the good fight as I like to call it as development director at rainforest action network. And then at Amazon Watch focusing on the Amazon Rainforest as a fundraiser. And I didn't realize that fundraising was cool, but it's activism and it's a beautiful nexus point for engaging people around, you know, what they care about. So, that's me, and that's how I got here. I'm really excited to be part of Rainforest Rescue and really happy to share with you. Thank you, Branden. Kamala, could you give us an overview of your job and your career trajectory and what led you to having this career? you. I've come alone now working at Sri Sri University, I studied political science [inaudible] public policy at Monash University in Australia, and that kind of training of it, was very very useful for coming back to India and thinking of making a contribution. What I like about Australia education is that they actually instill that confidence at one level and also that responsibility that whatever training and education getting [inaudible]. So in that way, that was the inspiration from coastal state is largely affected [inaudible] of several disasters. And now in last 20 years, what emerged as a disaster management leader in Asia-Pacific MiTek minister, Mr. [inaudible] has made the industry models, which are the United Nations and others are formulating now. So this is the backdrop and context where I joined the new university's develop [audible] center for climate change and sustainability. So my training in social sciences, political science, economics, law, and governance helped me to navigate the interdisciplinary nature of climate change and sustainability to an extent where I'm more capable or perhaps competent to engage with the subject at the company level, at the community level, at the level of management means business leaders that, so that, so that kind of education is introduced and I'm very happy that UTS has launched just such an interdisciplinary program, which is absolutely absolutely important. And fantastic. Thank you, Kamala. Now let's ask Christina, if you could give us a quick three minute overview of your job and how you came to be doing running your small company. Thank you, Kate. My Australian journey actually started 12 years ago when I came here as an international student from Germany. And after I graduated, I've been working across a variety of different marketing and communication roles from for small startups, but also big, bigger global conglomerates. And having worked for the corporate world all my life, I really felt the urge to do something more purpose-driven. I realized, I just, I needed to do something that would make the world a better place. And when my son, Isaac arrived three years ago, it truly changed my outlook on life. And I felt like all of a sudden I was responsible not just for myself anymore, but also for him and his kids and their kids. And then parallel to that, I I realized how much or how fast kids were growing out of their clothing. And I started looking into more sustainable brands that I could buy from. But to my surprise, they were really a handful that I could turn to. And then I started doing some serious research into, into the fashion industry. And I found that the fashion industry was responsible for over 10% of global carbon emissions, which is just so bad. And it's also the second largest consumer in terms of water the world's water supply and over 75% of supply chain textiles end up in landfill. So there is just so much waste associated with that industry. And it's really a dirty business. And look at it, it got worse because if we think of polyester, which is just a fancy term of plastic, right? We wash that in our washing machine and it actually releases tiny little microplastics into the waterways, which then end up in our oceans and fish ingest that plastic. And in turn, they end up on our plates and we eat the fish and we also eat the plastic. So in order to disrupt the fast fashion industry, I started my own business to provide parents with a more eco-friendly alternative to some of the fashion brands or kids' clothing. That was, that was out there. And at Indie & Isaac, it's our main aim to change consumerism and to reduce fashion waste to landfill by educating parents and the public about the impact that choices have on the planet. And we only sell brands that have really strict sustainability practices in place and brands that align with our own values and brands that, yeah, look after their employees, their workers, and their communities and planet as a, as a whole. And we also offer a buyback guarantee of over 100 brands that we define our sustainable to keep more fashion in the circular economy and to yeah. To reduce fashion waste going to landfill. And I think the circular economy model is really critical when we talk about sustainability because in a circular economy, there is no waste. And I'm looking at some of the sustainable businesses I've been working with over the past years. It's really something we need to adopt and educate more about. Because it looks at, you know, the sourcing of the materials all the way through to the end of life, disposal of products. And ultimately, fashion shouldn't cost lives, and it shouldn't cost the planet. And it's as simple as that. Thank you, Christina. Sian, I'd like to come to you now, if you could tell us in a few minutes about yourself, what made you enroll in the Bachelor of Sustainability and Environment here at UTS? Thanks, Kate. Hi everyone, I'm Sian. And as you would have heard, I am currently studying in UTS in Bachelor of Sustainability and Environment. And I decided that I was going to pair that with Bachelor of Business. So that's what I'm currently doing. I'm in my first year at the moment, but I actually didn't originally choose this degree when I first came out of uni. So I was originally at a different uni just studying business. And then I just wasn't feeling inspired enough of my liking. So I started searching around and I actually found UTS has brand new degree online. So I had a look and it looked amazing. It was hands-on and it looked like the teaching team was passionate and from a variety of different areas and it just looked amazing, but I was already in a degree, so I just closed the tab and moved on with my life until I was there three months later, still thinking about that degree. So I decided that this is exactly what I was looking for. I had been slowly becoming more interested in sustainability in my final years of high school, doing little projects and slowly it was consuming my life. And I decided that that was my passion and where I wanted to go. So I dropped my old degree and I chose to come to UTS. And I'm very excited to be part of this degree and very proud because I think it's a very special degree and have no regrets of choosing this path at all. Thank you. I'm very glad to hear it. Okay. Now I'd like to ask Branden and Christina, some, a couple of quick question about the, well, the Australian perspective, and then I'll move on to a slightly different question to ask Kamala. So for Branden and Christina, companies and organizations are increasingly seeing sustainability as a core part of their business, and how can you see this in your industry or the organizations that you work with? And could you give some examples? So this time I might start with Christina first and then move to Branden. Thanks, Kate. Yes. I feel like the past decade has certainly been all about awareness and the public waking to the problems of plastic pollution and global warming. And that was critical because in order to improve or lessen your environmental footprint, you have to understand at first, and I've certainly seen a shift from businesses transforming their entire supply chains to become more sustainable and much more transparency as well from businesses through their annual sustainability reports or yeah, give back programs like, you know, donating to conservation organizations like rainforest rescue or planting more trees. And the last 10, five to 10 years have seen extreme growth in the sustainability space across all disciplines, not just fashion, but also, you know, renewable energy and, and packaging. And I've also witnessed the rise of b corps or so-called benefit corporations who are new types of entities and they are not, not for profits, but they are purpose driven businesses who donate percentages of their sales or profits to conservation organizations or yeah. People in need or they become certified carbon neutral to give back as much as they take from the planet, but also, well, despite the rise of conscious companies, I also think that there's a lot of greenwashing across all industries, meaning that some companies make very vague or faulty sustainability claims purely because their marketing hooks to drive more sales. And I think now more than ever, it's really important that we educate the public around that and that we equip them with the knowledge to combat greenwashing and for fashion, for example, in fashion, it's really simple. You would just look out for certifications and if a brand, if a brand can provide any sort of certifications don't buy from that company you know, people cannot put their wallet where their mouth is. They can use the purchasing power to drive positive change. And I've certainly seen that shift. And particularly with the next generation generation Z two of the main priorities are intersectional environmentalism and climate change, and they stand alongside Greta Thunberg, they take it to the streets. They have witnessed the decay of our world and, you know, the impacts global warming has already had on our nature. Like, just look at all the natural disasters that are happening everywhere in the world. So I've definitely witnessed change. And I think sustainability is no longer just a trend it's, it's become a mindset and a way of living and people are ready to fight for change and to make this world a better place. And yeah, I've seen it in form of increasing sales, but I've also noticed it from all the overwhelmingly positive feedback we get through our social media communities and through letters I get from extremely happy customers. Thanks. Thank you. Brandon? I wonder if you could give us your perspective on how sustainability is part of a core part of business now? Sure. Christina, that was such a beautiful answer. I feel like you're an excellent example of the new wave of businesses. You know, that the environmental organizations it's bet you're better than some of the environmental organizations were 10 years ago. That was really inspiring. Really good to hear. So it's a funny question for me because Rainforest Rescue you know, helps other businesses deepen their sustainability. So as Christina was saying you know, businesses that want to give back businesses that want to you know, be part of the solution to the challenges that our planet, that our biosphere, that our ecosystems are facing. I, you know, it's not easy to start in an environmental initiative, that's gonna make a big difference. There's a great commercial. I want everyone to go to YouTube and look up Rainrorest Alliance, follow the frog. Particularly those of you that are in marketing, you'll love it. You know, you don't have to give up your job and go to the Amazon and you know, help organize indigenous peoples to fight the oil companies. You know, Greenpeace will do that or Amazon Watch we'll do that. And, you know, rainforest rescue has a really robust business partnerships program that enables businesses to, to be part of our work. And it's a real partnership and we have different types of relationships that people can can engage with. You can have, you know, tier level partners where people can be, you know, all the way up to a platinum level based on how much money their organization gives, which equates to the number of trees that we plant and then maintain over a couple of years until they form a canopy and they're good on their own. There's the canopy club, which means that businesses can just put whatever they want really into our program on an annual basis. Then there's 1% for rainforest rescue, which is 1% of profits, but those are all examples of businesses are hungry for being part of the solution. And, you know, for too long businesses have been part of the extractive exploitative system, and it's killing us. And it's clear now that that's the case, and that's why you guys are looking at the sustainability discipline and it's really good news. And it's, it's really exciting to see that that non-profit organizations no longer have to rely just on individuals or government grants or philanthropic grants, but businesses are becoming a real force for good and a force for positive environmental change and sustainability. The, the reference to be corpse I think is a really important one. If y'all don't know what B corporations are, literally just go Google it. B Corps are businesses that want to give back and instead of your triple bottom line, it's the quadruple bottom line. So it's, it's good for people and planet and it's it's it gives me great hope and B Corps started in the US but now they're all over the world. And Australia has a really great growing community of B corporations. Thanks, Branden. Kamala, could you give us a perspective from Asia on this, on this shift towards sustainability being part of the core business of many organizations now. Yes, sustainability or green jobs are way too important. And by 2030, and assessment by [inaudible] and 24 million people will be required in the sustainable economy to form green jobs. And that is mainstream, 24 million jobs and that, and one day, because there are more green jobs required as well. So, and all companies will be transferring or shifting their base from a fossil fuel base to energy renewable base, and from carbon base with decarbonised base. So is this [inaudible] which just happened, started happening with the major industries that are greenwashing definitely yes, that we agree with that, but suddently industries are very very keen taking this forward and government civil society. Asia is going to get up after 2024, you'll see more opportunities coming out and more people, people who will be graduating from your institution and university will get the umpteen number of opportunities, not only just to intern research and contribute, but to get a job and also perhaps become entrepreneurs, climate entrepreneurs. So these are certain opportunities in emerging. I can take the case of India as I can see the prime minister Narendra Modi has been very very keen on sustainability as he's one of the founders of the [inaudible] president, then president International Solar Alliance. So solar is becoming very huge in India, and slowly is very surprising that the economic policy they have followed is actually rising the price of the flue. But by the end of, they are accurately incentivizing [inaudible] and electric car [inaudible] EVs are becoming very important, and we have a several motor companies [inaudible] with us, but we do not have enough people who understand how society, economy, and industry interact with each other in on text. Responsibility's another sector where that will be going a long, a lot of requirement of people who are dreamed and the triple bottom line people, profit and planet. So by something like what you are giving here, his brilliant and Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, and South Asia, you'll see a lot of jobs that we need to come up in there because he's very keen to catch up with the developed world. Thank you, Kamala. I'd like to ask you now what your career aspirations are and how you think a double degree might help you with this. And also any experiences you've had so far in exploring professional pathways within the degree. People often ask me when I tell them that I'm doing sustainability, what I'd like to do. And I have to be honest at this point, I have no idea. I'm okay with that right now, considering I'm in the, in my first year, I'm not too stressed about it. And what makes it even less stressful is that the degree has already within one and a half semesters opened my eyes to so many possibilities. So I do know what I do know is that I'd like to make sustainability more accessible to everyone because I've seen in a lot of conversations I've had that people are somewhat paralyzed at times by their, some people call it eco anxiety, or just not being sure exactly what to do, because it's such an overwhelming and such a large issue. So making it accessible to people, individuals, and also to businesses. So by studying my double degree with business, it allows me to understand how businesses operate in the status quo and how that might be able to change by pairing it with my sustainability degree. So I have a good base in business, and then I can use that to have a, quite an impactful career. I hope. But also in the degree, we've already had an industry panel in our, one of our subjects. So we had an, a panel with people from Deloitte. There was someone from health infrastructure, new south Wales and just, there were a few other people in there that just showed us that there are lots of different paths that we can take with, with our sustainability degree. And also depending on which other double degree you do. So a lot of the science students found it helpful to see which science pathway they might take or health science or management as well. So I don't know is the answer, but being surrounded by lecturers and also panelists and different opportunities to see what the possibilities are certainly makes it a lot less stressful and quite exciting as well. So this question is for Branden, Kamala and Christina, over the next five years, what do you think are the key sustainability challenges that organizations will need to grapple with and what kind of jobs will these challenges create and what kind of skills or qualifications will people seeking those jobs need to have? So I might start this time with Kamala and then go to Branden and Christina. Yeah. I think a lot of job opportunities are already happening because of [inaudible] around the world. Our, our balance matters a lot for our survival, not just our survival survival of the next generation. So that is one the COVID has made many more people equal wage, organic wage and become educated in at some places. And they've started planting. So these awarenesses are actually dawning are happening among the consumers. If I take that work on the market, chief consumer greenwashing, the lesson, that one will be that we'll be posting the business, this and the documents to take action on sustainability agenda, which is 2030. That is one upgrade I'm seeing. And second trend, I was, I I'm very hopeful that the companies will be Celtic clearing that these products are eco-friendly and they will be subtly. Certainly weighing the bio-degradable weight, how, whenever it is possible, this is the point of the two, one number three, that will be a five bag arrangement that is worth you must start asking for, for example, it's a footwear, which is not usable, but by the flux of the company. So by the circular economy is going to be tapped and sustainable fashion. And that is definitely, that is going to be very, very important. So apart from the automobile industry, the fossil fuel industry, the coal, renewable energy or sustainable fasteners are going to be very, very fashionable in the days to come. So people who are skillful to navigate to economics, to environment, to environment, impact assessment, to community engagement through our Ms creation policy analyst is kind of understanding how climate change is happening discussions at the diplomacy level, and that they are the ones who are the best suited to make any difference or making change or advocate for better skills will be definitely communication and community, organization, fundraising, and all that. And, and, and definitely in it, our miss at the international thing that is happening around the world and your connection with the world as well. Thank you. Thanks. Christina, what are your perspectives on this question of challenges over the next five years and the kinds of skills and things needed? So I think why the last decade was all about, you know, awareness. The next five to 10 years will be all about speed and acceleration. And the early adopters have adopted long time ago. So I feel like now we're going mainstream, and we need to get everyone on board and really future proof our being. But I also think that there are other challenges that we're facing that you might not always link to sustainability directly. For example, in 2020, the International Women's Day promoted the message and equal world is an enabled world to encourage people, to find buyers and empower women. Because when you empower women, you empower communities because women tend to share their knowledge and empower others with their knowledge. And I think in regards to fashion, it's important to know that most factory workers are women and they're working long hours, and they're often working in really dangerous conditions. And they're working for brands like Zara and H&M brands we buy from every day, right? So they might not get paid a living wage. And when you buy from these brands, you basically support the exploitation of these workers and women shouldn't have to risk their lives to be able to feed their families. I believe that gender parity and social justice globally are two issues that brands have to address and have to get behind to not just stay economically competitive, but also to show to consumers who made their clothes because consumers would want to know. And as for the kinds of job in demand or who I think will be increasingly more important, I think that and that also might address Sian's comments around, you know, not knowing what career she can see for herself. I wouldn't stress too much because I think with a sustainability degree, you can almost do anything. You can go into any industry and, and create change. And any industry will have to reinvent itself over the next three to five years to mitigate climate change. And you could work as a sustainability manager or a sustainability consultant. And again, you can do that for any industry. But I also see roles in sustainable design or sustainable architecture increase over the next decade because we will have to build more sustainable cities that look after all that feature, urban farms and energy conservation, but also environmental scientists who understand and who can predict the trajectory we're on and how we can change that trajectory to to combat climate change. And last but not least, I wanted to say we also need more influences like teachers academics, but also politicians who understand climate change and who can, who can implement legislation and, and empower others to to, to follow. So I think, yeah, as, as as soon as we understand the impact global warming and plastic pollution has on our cities on animals, but also the future of our children, you know, we might not throw away that pair of jeans next time we might actually fix it and keep it for another year or two and look in the end, no one is perfect, but understanding the problem is the first, and I think the most important step towards yeah, facing, sorry, addressing the problems that we're facing today. And yeah, we need more, we need not, we need more inspiring leaders to yeah. To create the change that we want to see. Thanks. Branden, what do you think the big challenges are in the next five years and the kinds of jobs that will be associated with that? Well, the kinds of challenges in the next five years Christina, that was excellent. You're hired. I think one of the jobs, well, I think sustainability has a place everywhere, right? Like, you know, once upon a time we thought that politicians would do the right thing. If only there was enough supports to push them in the right direction. And we believed, I believed that they were generally good people who are trying to do a good job for the people they represented. That would be lovely if that were the case. It does not seem to be so, and it's going to take all of us to, to move the needle, you know, towards sustainability. And I have a real problem with the word sustainability. We were talking about it earlier. It's just such a boring vanilla beige kind of word. Like, you know, when do we get to thriving you? Well, we've got, we've got a ways to go, but having sustainability in the ethics at the core of every business is essential just as I used to believe that all politicians were good people trying to serve the people they represented. I actually believed that that everybody has a stake in, in doing the right thing. And it's becoming quite clear with global warming and the kinds of terrible news that we're, we're seeing on a regular and increasingly frequent basis. So yes, you know, you can do, you can do more with sustainability at your core for a greener healthier planet so that we can all thrive into the future seven generations. If you take sustainability with you and there are all kinds of great jobs that have emerged that didn't exist 10 years ago, I mean, who thought there would be a chief sustainability officer at every major corporation now? But as Christina said, you know, it's about leadership. You know, we need leaders and everyone has the ability to be a leader wherever they are. And it's something that we all have to step up and, and do you know, we've got to end exploitation, we've got to stop thinking about humanity first. You know, we're not the only ones here and it's not enough to say let's make it sustainable. Let's make it, let's make it equitable. You know, let's, let's make it a world, not just for the people to, to be sustained. No, let's do it for all. Life is a beautiful planet. You know, we didn't inherit it, you know we, we, we belong to it and we can take care of it in whatever we do, but arming ourselves with the knowledge of, of what we need to do in order to make it right. And that's where it starts. You know, we need to, we need to build it back and we need to nurture it. You know, fast fashion is an issue. Deforestation is an issue, pick your issue, dive into it. But whatever you do make it part of who you are and be that leader. Yeah. And check out the STGs as well while we're at it. Thanks Branden. Actually, before you escape I would like to ask you there's one grounding of question for each of the three of you before we go to the general question and answer is to what is the role of cross-disciplinary understanding into, in tackling sustainability challenges? So if we could start with Branden us, what you see the role of cross-disciplinary understandings are in these challenge. Sure. I kind of, I kind of spilled into that with my way word answer to the last question, but it has to be crossed is a plenary, you know, the problems that we're dealing with, they're not simple, straightforward problems anymore. They're becoming increasingly complex and they require new ways of thinking and new ways of being, you know, and for that, we're all gonna have to big date. We're all gonna have to commit to making the most of this amazing life that we've been given by being the very best people we can be. Again, you know, we didn't inherit the earth, we belong to it. So, you know, whatever you do, you're going to have to bring multiple hats to the table, be a good advocate, be a compassionate activist, be a thoughtful ally, learn to communicate better than you can believe and to engage and enroll others as a way of life speak on behalf of nature's wholeness and regeneration take that into whatever career you choose this or, or whichever career chooses you. Thanks, Branden. The way of regeneration is a good one. If we're thinking of alternatives to sustainability. I would like to ask Kamala and then Christina, what they think about the role of cross-disciplinary understanding in the challenges we're facing. This is a climate change just on the [inaudible] and cross-disciplinarity whatever word you want to use. Multi-Disciplinary and non-disciplinary that shouldn't be in any discipline, not such to talk about the [inaudible] scientists have gotten up there and they have given up now. That's like, okay, every once, but that's a good thing to do. So I think a public policy that I come from where I have been able to get it government and get it, their political leaders so that they can become brand ambassadors of certain things. So creating brand of Buster's ship. And that's a very important, so management economics [inaudible] studies in general literature, very important how you do a drama on theater and attract the attention people, and also knowledge of the past kind of in indigenous communities. What we are thinking about the nature of the planet, the environment, maybe the climate change was not that serious at that time and in the memory, what is this? So trying to understand that. So [inaudible] kind of interdisciplinarity thinking, every, each flavor actually specifies become a story, but you understand, look at the end of multiple subjects coming together and giving the sense of what climate change natural is doing and how the chips can be tackled as well. So if it's interdisciplinary and I see a lot of value in public policy and communication, that's where. Thank you, Kamala. Christina, or do you think about cross disciplinary understanding? To be honest, I'm not sure if I can add much to Brendan and Kamala's responses. There were pretty perfect, but I still I'd like to say we cannot solve the climate crisis by just shouting at politicians alone rice, and look, don't get me wrong. I'm an activist. And I, I totally believe in the power of our collective, but we do need scientists. We need data analysts. We need politicians, we need marketing and communication managers who, who can articulate the message to the world. And we need leaders to, to make a change. And we need CEOs who lead by example and who create sustainable purpose-driven businesses that put people before profits. And I think you require a cross-disciplinary education for that. Thank you. Okay. So the next part of what we're doing today is a general question answer. And so we're moving to some questions that are, have been posted in the Q&A part of the webinar. And the first one we have is aside from the clothing industry, are there any other industries that we wouldn't think of that are unsustainable? So like to pass this to the panel, can anyone tell us about an industry that we might not have thought of that has some serious sustainability problems? Brandon, I see you took your mic off. All of them? But, but you know, in all seriousness, everything is still level up. And if you want to look at industries that really need help agriculture, huge energy, huge yeah, those two right there. Go fix that. That would be excellent. Those are the ones that come up immediately, but you know, keep going publishing, you know, you see a lot of cheap books now coming out of China and they don't have the same requirements for sustainability that you'd find in other countries. So you get cheap. You know, and they're just mowing forest down. Forestry, there's another good one to tackle. My idea of an excellent forestry industry is one that doesn't cut down. Trees let's make that one real. Yeah, actually I had the other day about Bitcoin and because there's so much activity that goes on with Bitcoin and it requires so many servers that are using so much energy, there's huge greenhouse gas emissions, apparently from Bitcoin. So that was one that surprised me. Another question we have is what kind of jobs can I do with this degree? I think we, the panelists did cover quite a few of the different kinds of jobs. So many organizations have now either sustainability officers or sustainability managers or coordinators, and actually a lot of organizations. It's not just one person. It's a small team now. As well as more specific things like sustainability engineers, we then help for engineering, but there are you could be a sustainability marketing manager and be working on some of those things around the marketing angles of sustainability. Do any of the panel members have an answer to this question about the kinds of jobs that are possible with the degree in sustainability and environment mixed with the other degrees that we've got here at UTS, which I've been at business management health and Kristine might help you in with the other ones that I've forgotten. And Ecnomics. I think we mentioned a few earlier, but yeah, anything from, you know, in my mental scientists, health scientists, data analysts who understand the trajectory we're on and who can help us, you know, or who can tell us how much less meat do we have to eat? How much less waste do we have to produce to mitigate climate change and keep temperatures below 1.5 degrees and how can we meet the Paris the climate targets and how can we work in alignment with the global sustainability development goals? So there's a lot of metrics already out there, but I think we need more people who understand the data and who can also articulate the data to people who don't naturally understand data or who can visualize the data in more user friendly ways. Yeah, but, and again, look, I've said it a few times. I think we need more politicians who who understand climate change and who can implement legislation because ultimately we need when we really need leaders who support business and individuals in that space. Thanks, Christina. I just noticed that the time and we would finish at six 30, so Kristine Aquino, or do you think we should finish up now? So thank you. Thank you, Kate for facilitating that panel and thank you to our panelists Branden, Kamala, Christina, and Sian for your time. And thanks to those who who've sat in and viewed. And it was really a wonderful panel highlighting how the different environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability intersect and really speak to the approach that's embedded in this degree. So if you do want to find out more information here's a page you can look up particularly about what it's like to study at the university of technology Sydney and with the faculty of arts and social sciences, which is where this degree is housed. Thank you everyone. Thank you. English A UTS Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences information session, featuring Dr Scott Chadwick, Dr Alan Beckley, Professor Claude Roux, Dr Marie Moraleto. Hi everyone. And welcome to today's panel on criminology and forensics. This is hosted by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. Before I begin today, I would like to acknowledge doing an acknowledgement of country. So I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal People of the Eora Nation upon whose ancestral lands our city campus now stands. I pay respect to the Elders both past and present acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land. And as people of great ingenuity and innovation, before we get into the seminar today, I would just like to cover some housekeeping. So if you do have any questions for any of our speakers during today's session, you can please put them in the question and answer box down at the bottom of your screen. This webinar is being recorded and will be available to view at a later date, but bear in mind that it is only the presenter's cameras that are being recorded. None of your audio or visual is reported at this time. If you do have any questions about anything that is presented in today's session, you can contact us at fass.international@uts.edu.au. All right, so we're going to get in very quickly, but I'd just like to briefly introduce you to the speakers that we will be having today. So my name is Dr. Scott Chadwick and I am the director of undergraduate programs for the faculty of science. And I am a forensic scientist by trade and I'll be moderating today's session. But we will be hearing from some amazing academics and researchers in the area of both forensic science and criminology. And they are professor Prof. Claude Roux, Dr. Alan Beckley and Dr. Marie Morelato and in order to get let's get straight into it. And we're going to start off with Professor Claude Roux. Now Professor Claude Roux is the director of the UTS center for forensic science and he has been pivotal in the development of forensic science in Australia. And over the past 25 years, he has worked in developing and leading Australia's first undergraduate and PhD programs in forensic science. His research activities cover a broad spectrum of forensic science, including forensic intelligence and the contribution of forensic science to policing and security. So thank you Claude, and I'll let you get started. Thank you Scott, and welcome everyone. And I'm very pleased to give, be a bit of information about forensic science and criminology. It's interesting to know that criminology and forensic sounds share the same object of study and by that we mean crime and deviant behavior, the interesting thing is when we consider behavior and activities you know, by doing that, we leave traces. I'm sure, nowadays, especially during a lockdown period, we leave a lot of digital traces, you know, of our identity and our activities through our computer or digital devices, but in, in, you know, normal physical life, we also leave traces of all sorts of, of nature and forensic science will focus on, on these traces. These objective traces and forensic science will try to examine this traces and infer a lot of information from that these traces and in priority using the enabling disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Criminology willl focus on the social science approach, including using laws, psychology, sociology, design, et cetera. Now, the interesting thing you can see it's two different perspective of the same problem. The nexus between these two disciplines is growing because when we are the nexus, we can analyze the significant social problem and complex problem in a holistic manner. Now historically it's very interesting because more than 100 years ago, forensic science and criminology were almost parts of the same discipline. Both of them were largely derived from medicine and in social sciences, some people even said that they are born twins. Now, if we look at the forefathers of forensic science people like Hans Gross, Magistrates in the inquisitorial system very interested in crime scenes. Edmond Locard, very famous for Locard's exchange principal, who opened the first forensic science laboratory in Léon in France in 1910. Or Reiss who developed the first academic school and program of forensic science at the university of Lausanne in 1909. They all shared a very common feature. They are all very interested or they were all very interested in understanding criminality. And it's interesting to tell this anecdote about Reiss and Locard visiting each other in Léon and you know, they would go in the underworld precinct in Léon to observe what's going on you know, in this sort of underworld. Then later, almost the same time, shortly later in the US, you have someone like Vollmer, At the Berkeley university. He was a police administrator first, a criminologist, and he developed this concept of scientific policeman. So you see, you've got this sort of fun, you know, amalgamation of these two fields, which are seen slightly different for most people, but actually there is a large criminality. Forensic science and criminology gradually moved away from each other during the 1900, mainly because of technological development in forensic science. Now, the interesting thing is they reconverge over the last decade or so, especially through the development of forensic intelligence and, and Dr. Morelato will tell more about that. Now let's go back to these famous traces. These traces are really interesting and Marie will talk a bit more about that as well. But traces are collected because they are supposed to be connected with entities of interest, and because they have a potential utility in explaining the activity they originated from. Now, interestingly, each discipline interested in these sort of activities, meets forensic science at this point because law because this activity may mean an offense criminology, because the deciphered mechanisms can inform disorders, deviant behavior, or more broadly on crime and develop some strategies are to prevent or disrupt this sort of a crime or deviant behavior. So, you know, I hope I generated some interest showing you that actually it's two different perspective of the same problem. And really, I agree with the people who said that forensic science and criminology are born twins. Now, the interesting thing with with a double degree such as the one we are talking today is that it enables you know, future-proofing for jobs because people with both skillset of forensic science and criminology are very well equipped to actually you know, be ready for jobs that do not exist yet, or even maybe you know, even themselves developed or propose the new jobs of the future. So in the next slide, please, so in the next slide just to show you how in forensic science, we are interested in these traces that have been left by activity and presence, and that provides a lot of information about you know, the modus operandi of what could have happened. A lot of information about special temporary information, and it's possible to compare cases and compare traces and hence get some kind of profiling, but from the forensic science angle. Now, if you go on the right-hand side of the slide, you see a more common profiling for people who are interested in, in more social sciences. But actually both together can be very, very powerful. And it's what I was trying to add to tell you you know, during this few minutes to thank you very much. Great. Excellent. Thank you so much. Yeah, I think, I think it's very interesting that we may think that science and criminology don't necessarily overlap. But we can see that from the very beginning that these two areas have always been from the same, from the same discipline. So thank you Claude. I'd now like to introduce our next speaker Dr. Alan Beckley. So Dr. Alan Beckley was a police officer, but over 30 years in the United Kingdom, working in various roles from the ranks of constable to superintendent, and he first worked at the New South Wales Police Academy in Goulburn, teaching police recruits, and then moved to the Australian Graduate School of Policing in Manly and worked as a senior lecturer at Charles Sturt University. He's currently a curriculum advisor at the University of Technology Sydney in the International Studies and Education sector within the faculty of arts and social sciences. So thank you, Alan. Well, thanks very much. Scott. That was a very good introduction to me from what Claude was talking about. But I'm going to talk about criminology from a policing perspective. It's a very exciting time for criminology because of the changes and challenges and the crises in criminology at the present time. And I'll, I'll talk a bit about that as, as I go through. But it's interesting that Claude mentioned the history of criminology and and forensic science because they sort of interact really with policing policing started probably about 150 years ago. Most democratic countries started to appoint police forces around that time in the mid to mid sort of 19th century. But then the history of policing sort of lapses for about 150 years, nothing happens in policing or very little. And then we moved very swiftly on to the 20th century and 21st century. So roundabout the 1990s, we start thinking, well crime is overtaking us in terms of its number and its complexity and its violence. So the police need to do something about it. And they decided to introduce Watson. What's now being called intelligence, led policing. They suddenly realized something that they knew. Every experience police officer knew that about 60% of all crime is committed by 6% of the population. In other words, if you are able to concentrate on that 6% of the population, you certainly be solving quite a lot of the crime. So that's what intelligence led policing started to introduce, and it happened in the UK in Kent. And about 1919, It's spread sort of all around the world. And it's basically analysis driven and it's intelligence based. And you'll hear more about intelligence as, as, as the seminar progresses and it's all around the police being proactive and trying to solve crimes by the use of intelligence and forensic science which was started to introduce by they were the experts in crime, but they didn't know everything about crime. And they also needed to work with other organizations to actually solve crime and reduce it to an acceptable level in society. There was a bit of a love, hate relationship between the police and academics and researchers at that time, which, which nowadays is sort of almost reduced to nothing because police work with researchers and universities all the time now. [inaudible]. And I'll talk a little bit more about it in a moment. But the police suddenly realize that they couldn't do everything that, you know, that And that led on to a thing called evidence-based policing, which really means looking at policing techniques and only using techniques that are tried and tested. In other words, they're properly evaluated and assessed. And if they work, then they're promulgated around the world and also used by many different police forces. So they're proactive, they're tailored and focused and place orientation. So that is another term that you'll hear during the study of criminology is evidence-based policing. And also I'd like to talk about the impacts of technology on policing. If you can cast your minds back, maybe you can't before mobile phones came into being most of you probably weren't won't remember that, but if you look at the slide, you'll see a police box and you might recognize it, which is on a favorite programme called Dr. Who But we actually use these in the back in the 1970s, these police boxes because the only way to contact patrolling police officers was by stopping at a static mode as a static phone, a landline phone, and then talking to the police station, because there weren't any personal radios. There weren't any mobile phones, and there was no other way of contacting a police officer, and they were walking around a beat which is a sort of designated area for for an individual police officer. And they will be, they would make meetings with various people supervisors, or they will go into these police boxes to talk about that. And then of course, personal radios came on being follow following on from radios in police vehicles and then mobile telephony. And now, obviously everyone is aware of mobile phones nowadays, and every police officer will have one plus probably a radio as well, or a combined device with mobile telephony and moving on from that the police officers using body-worn cameras to record incidents that they attend. And and that, that can be used in evidence as well. So and it could also be linked with facial recognition technology more of which we'll talk about on, on, on the actual course itself because it does reveal certain issues, problems, and privacy issues as well. And also technology has revealed new crimes such as cyber crime, scams, ransomware, all of these types of things that you hear every day of the week, but they exist 50 years ago, even. So so that's a very brief history of placing. And as you can see, there are a tremendous number of changes and that police officers need the new skills to operate effectively in the current environment. And the third thing I'd like to talk about is some forensic science Claude mentioned some of the things, but fingerprinting for example, it was first used in 1850 in France and subsequently now, as we know, almost everyone is fingerprinted. If you go out through, in an airport, you have your fingerprints taken and there'll be checked against the database. But they're the first original fingerprints were slightly messy because they had to be taken on ink pads. And but now we've got much better equipment to, to take them digitally. So you might hear more about that from Scott, perhaps. And then the other thing that I wanted to talk about is DNA DNA technology interviews in 1984 in the UK. And now as you'll see on depicted on crime scene television programs. And it's, it looks as though it's the answer to everything, but it's not quite the answer to everything. It can be very useful to establish a crime scene traces and it can be useful because it is accepted in evidence. So but there are problems with that, and there are also privacy issues in relation to building up vast databases of DNA traces and also familial matches and racial identification through DNA. So there are problems, there are issues, which we'll also we'll be talking about during the course. I'm sure. So I think that's about it from me, but I hope you, you will sign up for the course and I'm sure it will be very interesting. Thank you very much. Great, thank you. Alan, just like Dr. Who, you took us through a journey through time and space, you know, in a very short matter of time. So that was, that was excellent. Thank you so much. I'm now liking to introduce our final speaker, and that's Dr. Marie Morelato. So Dr. Morelato is a senior lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney. She completed her Bachelor's and Master's degree in forensic science at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. Her research focuses on the triangulation of data that look at the illicit drug problem through many different angles, including crypto market drug discussion forums, illicit drug seizures, wastewater analysis, data from government sources and chemical analysis of used syringes. So thank you Marie, you good to go. Thanks, Scott. Hi everyone. So, thanks Scott for the introduction. In the next couple of minutes, I'm going to show you how forensic science has evolved from a purely reactive and court focus role to a more proactive role. So forensic science as many position itself as a service provider to the criminal justice system. And in this role the, the focus is past events and the aim is to solve particular cases. This role is mainly reactive hybrid over the years. The role of forensic science has expended and that's what Claude was mentioning in his, in his talk. And we argued that forensic science has a role to play in the security space. And in this space, we're not trying to regroup events coming from the same problem, recurrent problem. We're not trying to focus on each case separately, but we are trying to find to regroup like events coming from the same problem to find a general solution. So instead of looking at each case separately, or we adopt a case approach and try to find regularities and similar like repetitions. So in this framework, the aim is then to disrupt or prevent a crime from occurring and maybe reduce the fear of crime. So there is just a sense of proactivity. So one of the political strategy that was mentioned by Alan in his talk was intelligence led policing which is a way to use, analyze and organize information, to detect and better understand crime problems and use resources in a more proactive way. So as the trace, which is the remnant of criminal activity is one of the most basic unreliable element that stems from a criminal ordered an activity. It can actually be treated and analyzed systematically in combination with other information to detect patterns in the criminal activity. So this intelligence product can then use to make recommendation to a decision maker that can then act on the problem. So either for disruption or prevention so that this is what we actually called forensic intelligence. So I'm just going to give you an example of some of the research that we've done in the area of illicit drugs that will hopefully explain some of the concepts that I just covered. So if you could put the next slide, please. So if we look at the drug problem often what we observe is that it's the silo approach. So each organization will look at this problem from a different perspective. So for instance, if we look at the law enforcement agency we, we like the do enforcement just might make seizures of illicit drugs. The seizures can be analyzed and we can upturn opting the purity and the type of drugs that he's present in the seizures. So from an enforcement perspective, maybe the aim would be to persecute someone who is in possession of this drug. Then from a laboratory perspective, maybe destruct specimen could be analyzed. It could be chemically modified. So chemical, chemical profiling means that we are looking at the impurities that are present in the drug to see if they come from the same origin. So if you have two seizures of drugs and you look at their impurities profile, you could potentially infer that these two drug seizures come from the same source for, they might be a link between these two cases. So from a laboratory perspective, they might look at the case to case links. Then we've got health organization where we allocate more from the drug users perspective, where do surveys of drugs, what kind of drugs these people use, and the results could be used more in a harmonization minimization approach. Then that's obviously not all the type of organization that are involved in analyzing the drug problem, but it's just a few examples, but the last one would maybe come more from digital transformation that we observed. So obviously in the legal economy, you could see that is a transfer digital transformation, where one more people use online sources to obtain goods, like what are disclosed or anything even like food, et cetera. So in the illegal weld and illicit drugs, for instance, similar things are cured. So obviously criminals will use platforms that are online in order to promote and then potentially sell their drugs. But if we from maybe an academic point of view, we would analyze this data. So for instance, anything that is on the dark web, on crypto markets we could potentially have an understanding of what is actually sold on these platforms. Similar to social media and forums. We could analyze this data as well to obtain an understanding of what is actually discussed by consumers, if there is any substance that could be of interest and could problematic in the future. So in a preventive perspective, so this from a law enforcement perspective could be used to disrupt this network, or this market is online markets. So obviously all of this data source are there. But in the current approach, they are actually used not really combined with one another. So in the research that we've conducted, we try to actually combine these different source of information to obtain a better understanding of the drug problem. So here I mentioned illicit drug seizures. So we could chemically analyze them to obtain understanding if there is any links of illicit drugs. We could use online data, as I mentioned, the crypto markets, for instance, to have an understanding of the online markets. We could use surveys to have an understanding of the users. What kind of drugs ADI mainly using. So what kind of drugs should we focus on? Then you syringes content. We could potentially analyze the drug content of your syringes to see what is actually consumed by the cost, the consumer. And then wastewater analysis is another data source that we could potentially use to have an understanding of what kind of drugs are consumed in our, in our specific population. So you might've heard of wastewater and all of this because we hear a lot about it in the current times with COVID. So there's, it's been used a lot to to, to see what can Aflac, if there is a region of interest and we can do the same with it is a drugs. So if we combine all these data sources, we actually have a better understanding of the drug problem, and we can actually use a proactive approach rather than reactive approach. So that's about it for me. Thank you. Great. Thank you so much, Marie. I think it's really interesting that Marie talks a lot about broadening and looking at things at a different perspective. And I think that that's what a degree in criminology and forensic science, it will allow graduates and opportunity to look at things from not just from a single perspective, but a more holistic perspective. So we're not going to open up the the panel to have a question and answer session, so I can see that there are some already some questions in the question in it. So if you do have any questions either about the courses or about anything that was discussed in the panel session today, please do feel free to put those questions in the chat box. We are going to go through some of the questions now, and I might actually ask you to speak as could please put the videos back on so that we can have the opportunity to, to see and I'll direct some questions to the panelists as we go through. So the first question is actually Alan. So the question is, is there, this customer would like to know if they could become a police officer with this particular degree. Right? Well actually the the short answer to that is not with this particular group criminology degree because the the degree in policing is, is a more specific one, but where did the criminology degree there are very, there are several roles in the police force that you can apply for, for example, crime scene investigator the, the the type of information that we've been talking about, or a crime analyst, they're not actually sworn police officers, but they do have a specific role in the police service or the police force. So those are just two examples, but there are a number of other roles which people with a criminology degree could be employed by a police force. Great, excellent. And from the forensic science perspective, it's a, it's a similar answer in that it can provide you with the general background, but the requirement for policing is something that they do separate to a university course. All right. So the next question is what are the courses that are available in criminology and forensic science? So I might answer this one. So there is the bachelor of criminology and within the bachelor criminology, you can have the option of a few majors. So that's the major in digital security or analytics and research that you can also do a double degree with the bachelor of criminology and a bachelor of forensic science. And this is actually one of it's an incredibly unique course. It is only offered at UTS and it really leverages off the excellent criminology program that we have on offer, as well as the foundations of forensic science in building over 25 years. And we were the first forensic science course in Australia, and it's a really good combination of options there. You can also do the bachelor of criminology and international studies, which would allow students to have a year or a semester overseas. If anybody is interested in a forensic science course, we do offer just the regular bachelor of forensic science. But there are all majors in that course, which are chemistry, biology digital forensic science and crime scene investigation. You can also that with international studies or so a bachelor of laws. So all of the course information and cost structure is available on our website. And you can always check and see what the courses are there. Hey, we've got a few questions here. Can you do an internship as part of this program? So Alan, do you mind answering this question? Yes, it's good question. But there, there are specific issues and problems in relation to people doing internships with in a police organization. You can imagine that there's a lot of very sensitive information that the police gain as a result of interactions with individuals in the community. And so the answer to this, the short answer to the question is, no, I don't do internships. But you know, there are sort of, there are some opportunities to work with the police and look at how they how they operate, but they have, they're very carefully screened and very carefully chosen. So it wouldn't be like a normal internship that you would envisage, like a term of where you get a a sort of a job, a job in an organization and work on it for however long, the internship for is, you know, so a year or whatever, it's not like that you can't do that with policing because it's dealing with so many particular problems and, and risks and danger as we know. So the answer short answer is no, I'm afraid. Just to, to add from a forensic science perspective as well. So internships are a really big part of the university's mission. And as Alan has pointed out, it's a little bit more challenging when we are dealing with policing careers and that those opportunities may not be as plentiful as they are in other areas. However there are always opportunities to engage with academics and do internships on campus without our researchers in particular areas. So while you may not be doing an internship in the police force, you will, you will still have an opportunity to do an internship in the area of study, whether that's been criminology or forensic science. So we do understand that that isn't that incredible part of a student's experience. And we do want to make that happen. It's just a little bit more challenging for the criminology forensic science area. I might ask a question about the careers that can come from this particular degree. So Claude, do you mind giving us some ideas or some examples of potential careers that the forensic science could bring and then out for Alan for the criminology side? Thanks Scott. Look forensic science, as I mentioned you know, they, they, they asked some functions within police forces which requires highly technical and scientific skills. So typically crime scene is, is one of them. So we've got a very long, long history of placing graduates, forensic science graduates with police forces around Australia and even overseas through different pathways. It's, there is not one single answer in terms of which way you go about it, because it depends on the jurisdiction and on the country. Some jurisdictions have people in crime scene, you know, full civilians and can go straight after your degree, like, like this one or straight forensic science degree. In some jurisdiction you have to to do a fast track police academy type of training. After the degree, then you have the, all the, the jobs that are in I would say traditional forensic science laboratories or the laboratories where they do things like DNA analysis and drugs and toxicology, and quite often the some kind of government laboratories, or it can be within a police force, but they are full scientists like Victoria, for example, their, their forensic science laboratory is within the police. The same thing for ASB new south Wales police it's different. There is not a laboratory under the new Southwest government doing these sort of analysis. Then you've got all the different types of analytical operatories, whether we talk about regulatory laboratories, you know, racing, doping and Swan which are, you know, employ a lot of our graduates. And you've got a lot of private businesses especially especially in a consultancy firms. And I'm a say now with a kind of big digital transformation we are going for you know, digital forensic science is going to be a big one. I just kind of the new DNA. And there are a lot of big, big firms consultancy or financial companies, financial firms who are doing a lot of internal investigation or, or private types of investigation. And they use a lot of our graduates and potentially future graduate of, of that double degree. One thing I'd like just to add very briefly, and I just mentioned that before, but in passing society's changing very quickly, so we have to be very agile. And so our graduates have to be very agile and, and with a degree and especially double degree that is on offer for here. It's a, it's a great way really, to be prepared, as I mentioned for jobs that do not exist yet, but are just around the corner. And it's the kind of experience we've seen overseas, where they, in places where the head of, you know, very similar type of have double degrees. And all of a sudden there is, you know, a new crowd of people developing a new time, new types of jobs, and they are just there at the right time at the right place. Great. Thank you. Cool. Alan, do you mind answering some career questions or the criminology side. Right? Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Scott. Well, I sort of touched on this before in the, in answer to the previous question, as I say, the criminology degree, the bachelor of criminology work actually get you directly into a police force as a police officer, because you'll have to do some more work and some more study. The reason for that is police officers need to know detail around criminal law. They need to know what powers police officers have powers of arrest, search, seizure very detailed information. And so therefore you know, you couldn't be accepted straight into the police force without that extra study. So what can you do in the police force? Well we mentioned, I think Marie mentioned, and I mentioned intelligence led policing and the police, the police forces are always looking for very bright people to help them on that intelligence side of policing. So we're looking for people who are intelligence analysts, crime analysts, we're looking for as, as Claude was mentioning crime scene investigators, but we're also looking at general management of policing. So for example, in new south Wales police force, there are about 16,000 sworn police officers. So those are police officers and detectives working on in, in, in various different local area commands around new south Wales. But also they're backed up by a lot of support personnel, probably about five to 6,000 support personnel. And those are, are people who are working in offices, let's say all around the state and they're supporting the police officers in management or supply roles, or they're helping them to do the licensing function. So for example firearms licensing and all sorts of different licensing that is administered by the new south Wales police force, but not, that's not done by directly by sworn police officers. And they are if you like civilian support workers. So there's, there's lots of it. There's lots of opportunities. And as I say the, the changes that I've taught I've mentioned in my eight minutes when the police police forces are looking for very bright people throughout their organization, not just sworn police officers. Great. Excellent. I might, there are some questions still in the, in the chat I'm on, we might finish on one question and then if your question was not answered in today's session, we will do our best to follow up with you to answer that question. Or if you do have any questions after the session today, you can always send an email to fast.international@uts.edu.au. So the question is around what kind of student assignments would there be I can just sort of speak to the general philosophy at UTS is that the, the, the types of assessments that we have for our students are all about allowing students to demonstrate their skills, their knowledge, their understanding in a whole range of different areas. We understand that maybe traditionally exams and essays have been how people have had assessments in the past. But we understand that when you move out into the real world, that's not necessarily how you are going to be judged on your performance. So definitely from the sort of science side, we're very much focused on practical skills and practical hands-on learning. So some examples of assignments from that side of the, the degree would be things around practical experiences, like, you know, crime scene courses you'll have the opportunity to, to analyze a mock crime scene like you would, if you were in you know, an actual crime scene investigator. We have things like scientific reports or scientific presentations where you might have to talk to some experiments that you've performed and explain what you've done and the results that you've found. From the criminology side, it might be more around policy documents you know, performing some level of research or literature for the particular problem that is trying to be addressed as part of the particular subject or area that you're studying. And oral presentations, our group work team based assessments are also very poor to the different types of assessments that students have. So we do acknowledge that exam may have been a part of your life prior to coming to UTS and, and it will certainly be but it's about giving you a more holistic assessment of your understanding in a course and in a particular area. So you will experience a whole range of different coming to UTS. So I'm gonna re at the, at the end of today's session. So I would just like to thank our three speakers Prof. Claude Roux, Dr. Alan Beckley and Dr. Marie Morelato. If you do have any other questions, as I said, you can email fass.international@uts.edu.edu, there is also a fast, specific page that you can visit. If we just want to pop over to the next slide, we can find out what life is like in the fast lane, or just briefly there, that's a quick rundown of the different course and the structure there. So that's again, we'll make these slides available to, so you can see all of the information that was presented in today's session and you can always visit our website to find out more specific information. So I thank you all for coming and hope to see you at UTS very soon. English Led by Associate Professor Andrew Hurley, learn more about the brand new course, the Bachelor of Criminology. Discover how this industry-oriented course has been crafted to produce skilled, forward-thinking graduates, ready for careers in law enforcement, criminal justice, cybersecurity and crime prevention. Speaker 1: It's just gone 17 minutes past, I think. So I will make a start at firstly, like to just acknowledge country UTS. The main campus on Broadway is on, uh, Gadigal country, uh, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation. And I would like to pay my respects to the Gadigal people, to their elders past present and emerging. And I'd like [00:00:30] you also to think about where you might be coming into this, uh, remote session from I'm also on Gadigal land right now. So you might like to just think about where you are, what particular, uh, uh, indigenous land you're on my name's Andrew Hurley. I'm the deputy head of school here in the school of international studies and education at, uh, FAC the faculty of arts and social sciences at UTS. I have a background in international studies and in, [00:01:00] uh, in the law before I commenced my career as an academic, uh, I worked as a solicitor and I worked in an area of criminal law. Speaker 1: But if I say to you all, now, what's the first crime that comes into your mind when I say crime or criminology, like, just do that for a moment. What was the first thing that came into mind? Maybe cyber security, cyber crime, maybe, [00:01:30] uh, some, uh, some things like, uh, assault or, uh, perhaps, uh, you know, culpable driving in, in a motor accident, but probably not the area of criminal law that I worked in, which was occupational health and safety and also environmental law. So, uh, prosecutions, uh, in a, in a specific area of criminal law and procedure for, um, unsafe workplaces, but also for [00:02:00] things like spills, uh, emissions of, of things in, um, in the environmental sector. That's enough about me though. I'd like to also allow my colleagues who were here today, presenting with me about the bachelor of criminology, this brand new degree to introduce themselves. So over to you Allana, Speaker 2: Hi everyone. Uh, I'm Alana Piper. I'm also coming to you from Gadigal land, just two blocks from the university campus, as a matter of fact. Uh, so my background [00:02:30] is I'm a, uh, criminal justice historian at the faculty of arts and social sciences. And I'm really interested in analyzing long-term trends in criminal offending and how we as a society respond to it. And I will hand over to Joanna, Speaker 3: Thank you a lot on hi everyone. My name is Joanna Y and I'm a senior lecturer in the school of mathematical and physical sciences in the faculty of science. I have a background in statistics and my is in the analysis [00:03:00] of crime data and evaluation of policy programs and rebuilds in a criminal justice system. Speaker 1: Thanks Elena. And thanks Joanna. So you're all here today and you've probably got a number of questions. I'm going to pose a couple for you now, which applied degree sets you up for a job in an expanding sector. I've mentioned already cyber security, but perhaps you're thinking about transnational aspects of crime today as [00:03:30] well, which degree offers you great specializations and combinations to stand out in the marketplace? Well, it's probably no surprise if I say to you, the criminology degrees, these brand new criminology degrees, which we're launching here at UTS and which we're talking about today. So what are they, they're social sciences degrees, uh, with a critical scholarly focus on crime law and society. And we've [00:04:00] put these together not only with industry support and a great deal of consultation with the different industries, which you might end up working in, but also with a collaboration from colleagues in the faculty of science, the faculty of engineering and it, and also law. Speaker 1: So let's hear a little bit more about these degrees. First of all, I wanted to talk to you a bit about the standard majors. [00:04:30] So as I said, the bachelor of criminology, uh, has, uh, a number of, uh, different options. And there are three standard majors and everybody who does a criminology degree at UTS will do nine core subjects. And we'll talk a little bit more about them later, and then you do some majors, some specific subjects and some elective subjects. If you're in one of these three standard majors, so [00:05:00] forensics data and analytics and justice and legal studies, then you have about a semester's worth of elective subjects. You can do on top of that. I'll talk a little bit more about, uh, what those different subjects are in a moment. I'll show you a slide about those, but I'd like to just outline the different options for you in these different majors. Speaker 1: So forensics is really, if you're quite interested in crime scene investigation, maybe watch a bit of it on TV [00:05:30] and you're fascinated by, uh, uh, that aspect of things. Then forensics is probably the one for you. Uh, it's um, uh, involves quite a number of specific areas, uh, coming from our, uh, forensic science colleagues, um, data analytics on the other hand is more about, well data it's in the nine. So if you like data, if you like crunching data and numbers, um, and [00:06:00] the application, uh, of that in a, in a research or, or, or a policy area, then this could be the major for you. And you'll hear a little bit more about this side of things, uh, in a moment as well, uh, both from Allana, but also from, from Joanna, the justice and legal studies. Uh, uh, my major is probably the one closest to my heart with, uh, with the background that I have, uh, as a solicitor and that, uh, involves, um, really [00:06:30] a focus on criminal justice, criminal law, and procedure, and, uh, other things around that. Speaker 1: But, so if you're interested in, in, um, working in, uh, the criminal justice sector, uh, then that could be the major for you. So really these majors and the extended majors and the combined degrees, which we'll talk about in a moment, they all allow you to take a particular interest, uh, and the particular career path that you might [00:07:00] be interested in and to follow it by selecting a major, I'll just move on to the next slide, which is the first about extended majors. So what I didn't say is that the, each of, uh, our standard majors and, uh, our extended majors take three years of full-time study. So if you're doing an extended mighta, it doesn't add any extra time to your time at university it's three years. Um, [00:07:30] and, uh, with that, I'll, I'll just hand over to Alana to talk a little bit about this fun. Speaker 2: Yeah. So data analytics might not strike some of you as a particularly exciting area to major in, but actually I think it's really one of the most exciting majors to me, at least, um, because what you're going to be learning in that major is really how to detect patterns and trends in crime across time, um, and identify links and causes of the offending and learn how to [00:08:00] evaluate how interventions by the criminal justice system, by the community, um, affect and impact on rates of criminal offending and victimization. Now to, uh, undertake this major, we require that you have, uh, two units of English, as well as maths extension one. Um, because one of the key things that you'll be analyzing is not just qualitative data, but quantitative data numbers, statistics, um, to understand [00:08:30] crime rates, um, in terms of the sorts of subjects that you'll be doing in those major specific subjects. Speaker 2: It includes things like machine learning, applications, project, um, applications programming, and one of the other sort of great things about doing this majors is it means that you'll be doing actually two sort of industry placement projects. You'll do one within the core subjects that you studied, but you'll actually do an additional one also within the major [00:09:00] specific subjects, um, to do a sort of more extended project in, at the analytics and research space. Now, I think analytics and research they're highly transferable skills across any number of institutions that you might be interested in working in criminal justice would be looking for these skills as well as outside the criminal justice arena. If you went on to, um, decided you wanted to do different things in society at large, but, uh, if you're [00:09:30] what you're particularly interested in is perhaps working in criminal justice policy. So with, uh, community organizations or public policy organizations that are interested in conducting research and, uh, organizing initiatives to prevent crime or to rehabilitate offenders, um, I would say that this is the major, most appropriate view. Speaker 1: Thanks, Alanna. And I'd just say that if you do do the extended majors, this one or the [00:10:00] next one that I'm about to speak to you about in digital securities, you don't have as much elective choice. We were focusing down on a particular area, and that means that you don't have as much general elective choice. And, um, of the electives that, that you might do, if you do a standard major that could involve things like intercultural communication, learning, and language, um, there are particular, uh, internships opportunities to do things overseas. Um, [00:10:30] uh, and there are all sorts of things which if you do the standard major, there is a little bit more room. There's a semester's worth of room for that. If you choose one of these, uh, specialized what we call extended majors, uh, there is less time, um, in order to, to do that. Speaker 1: Uh, but of course you do have the extended major and that, that focus down, which is, is if you already know exactly what you want to go, exactly what you want to do in terms of, uh, Korea, uh, destination, [00:11:00] then one of those extended majors could really be for you. I said that too, and here's the next one? This is the, uh, bachelor of criminology to D in digital security. So you do an extra 72 credit points of, uh, of, um, subjects within this digital forensics major. What might that involve? Well, it's really focusing on, on aspects such as web systems, uh, cybersecurity, [00:11:30] um, digital and cyber crime, all sorts of things relating to that statistical design and analysis. There's a little bit of that in there too, but it's really, it does add that digital forensics major and, um, that will lead to, uh, as you might imagine, all sorts of jobs within cyber security, uh, in particular, again, there are, there is, uh, a, uh, an additional, [00:12:00] um, uh, requirement entry requirement. If you do want to do this digital security, um, uh, extended by nature, you'll need any two units of English and maths extension one, and you'll need inflammation, um, uh, processes in technology and software and design, design, and development, if you want to do it. So there is a little bit of an extra entry requirement there. Speaker 1: [00:12:30] We've had a question about, um, uh, this, this is great from an anonymous attendee, um, about the different sorts of combined degrees. There was a question in particular about doing, uh, a combined degree with a bachelor of forensic science and, um, that's one of them. The other one is the bachelor of international studies, and we do have some, uh, sub bachelor level combinations as well. Um, the bachelor of international studies, I might start with that. That's a five year [00:13:00] double degree, and that involves learning a language other than English editing involves going overseas. Uh, uh, if you want to, you don't have to, but it typically students would go overseas to a language or to a country where their language is spoken and, um, pursuing, uh, a, uh, a project in that setting overseas or doing, um, an exchange in that, in that country. And I'll [00:13:30] just give you an example of someone who did one of these, uh, um, uh, a bachelor of international studies with, and this person had a background in policing. Speaker 1: She went to France, uh, she went for six months in the bachelor of international studies. Part of the combined degree, you can go for up to a year, uh, but there is the possibility of going of going for six months. Um, this particular student, uh, was actually, she was a police officer. She was taking a little bit of time away from her, um, uh, from her work as a police officer [00:14:00] in order to do the bachelor of international studies. And she went to France for six months. She, uh, uh, came back speaking, fantastic French, um, and she pursued a major research project, which was, uh, which while she was there. And it was in, um, uh, involved interviewing, uh, uh, French police officers and, uh, drilling down on a specific attitude and approach to policing in the French context. And I met up [00:14:30] with her quite recently, and, uh, not only was that, that time, a life-changing experience going overseas for, for a long period of time, she's still in contact with the people whom she, uh, whom she interviewed. Speaker 1: And she came back, she went back into the police force and came back with a real passion for diversity, for diverse cultural situations, um, and was, was a real, uh, advocate and has been real advocate for, uh, you know, diversity [00:15:00] in approaches to policing, but also within the police force itself. So, I mean, that's, uh, a fantastic, uh, instance of the sort of, um, places that the combined degree with a bachelor in international studies can take you. And as I say, that's a five-year degree, uh, and involves learning a language. Um, if you wanted to do something in that line, but not over five years, then you can add a diploma in languages, which she gives you, uh, a language [00:15:30] as well. You do it on top of what you're doing. So it's like an over enrollment that's three years. And, uh, it, so it doesn't add any extra time to your bachelor of criminology. Speaker 1: It's just something that you add on top. The diploma in innovation comes from our colleagues in the transdisciplinary school and, uh, offers some of the sorts of subjects. If you've heard about our bachelor of, um, uh, uh, uh, creative intelligence and innovation, uh, it [00:16:00] adds some subjects from that. So it's a design thinking type of diploma, and that's something that you also don't need to add any extra time to your time at university. It doesn't overload you during semester, but it does have, uh, it fits in between semesters, if you like. So you'd be doing some work over winter and summer in that area. Uh, how many languages are available? I can answer that very quickly, six languages, and, uh, they are Chinese, uh, French, Italian, German, um, [00:16:30] Japanese and Spanish. And you can go to one of those countries, um, and there are all sorts of other exchange destinations as well. Speaker 1: Um, finally the, uh, bachelor of, uh, of, um, forensic science, which, which we've had the question about there, that is a four year degree. Um, so it's, uh, when it's in combination with a bachelor of criminology, it's a four year combined degree, and if you're really into your CSI, um, [00:17:00] and, and that side of things, then this is perhaps the one for you. Uh, it, uh, involves doing the core criminology subjects and it involves doing, um, the core forensic science subjects. And you also select a major within your bachelor of forensic science that could be in, um, uh, it could be in biology, it could be in chemistry. Um, it could be in forensic, digital forensics, [00:17:30] uh, could be in crime scene investigation as well. So, uh, that's something that you add. Uh, and then you also add, um, uh, 24 credit points. So one semester's worth of elective subjects in criminology as well. Speaker 1: So those different ones that I mentioned before, things like, um, you know, adding a language you can do, you can also add some, uh, in those elective subjects, you can do things relating to sustainability as well, uh, and [00:18:00] various different things. So there are all sorts of things that within that double degree, bachelor of forensic spectra, uh, criminology, you also get some of the, um, uh, some of the, uh, the electives, um, that come with the standard major in the criminology. Okay. So moving along, here's just an outline of, uh, the core subjects. So you can see them there, there are nine core subjects in criminology. I've just put out here [00:18:30] the different standard majors, justice, and legal studies, data analytics, and forensics, and you can see what's in those packages there. If you're doing the standard major already talked about a little of them, a little bit about that already, and about some of the different degrees, I'm sorry, some of the different careers that doing one of those standard majors will lead to. Speaker 1: I'm just going to move and show you what a study [00:19:00] plan might look like if you're doing the justice and legal studies major. So that's one of our standard majors is a three year full-time course. And you can see there we've plugged in what a study plan might look like for you, um, with a blend of, uh, of the, um, core subjects in criminology and the subjects in the, in the major happening interwoven across the three years. So you don't just do [00:19:30] criminology in the first year, uh, in the core, you also, we're also doing those major subjects right throughout the whole time, the different sorts of careers. We've talked about this as we've gone talking over the different majors, standard majors and extended majors in the combined degrees. And of course you can see a list of some of the different ones there. Um, I just had a couple of things, and I know my colleagues on the panel be interested to say things [00:20:00] in, in their presentations as well. Speaker 1: Um, what we've been hearing about as we've been speaking with, um, agencies and, and, uh, employers, uh, as we were building this degree was about, you know, the, the growth in, in particularly in that cyber security area. And the fact that not only are there firms, which specifically focus on prevention, uh, but they're also, you know, consultancy large consultancy [00:20:30] firms too, that have divisions, uh, relating to cybersecurity and to, um, to, to forensics. And, um, in many cases, what they're actually doing is putting together, investigating where there might've been a breach of the law. They're putting together a whole prosecution brief. So these are, this is a private sector, and then they're handing it to the police on a silver platter, uh, the prosecution brief, and the, um, the police had been able to take over [00:21:00] with the actual prosecution of, of the alleged offense. Speaker 1: So we're finding that there's a lot of that actually happening in, in, uh, the private sector. Um, I mentioned the fact that I worked in these, uh, uh, sort of niche areas of, of criminal law and criminal justice, occupational health and safety and environmental protection. And of course there are agencies that are relating to those as well in new south Wales. It's a safe work new south Wales, [00:21:30] uh, for occupational health and safety who prosecuted. And there's also the environment protection authority who also both of those, uh, agencies, uh, employ people to do policy work, um, to put together prosecution briefs and so forth, uh, and to investigate cases. So there are all sorts of opportunities there too. Um, I will hand over to, um, one of my colleagues now, and that's Joanna to talk about her work [00:22:00] as a crime statistics statistician, cause that'll give you a little bit of an idea of some of the opportunities if you follow that sort of path too. So Joanna, thank you, Andrew. Speaker 3: Um, so now talk about, so before joining UTS, I was working, um, at boxer. So boxer stands for the bureau of crime statistics and research, and it's a statistical and research agency that sits within the department of communities and justice. It has three main areas [00:22:30] of activities in research and evaluation. They undertake rigorous evaluations to determine the effectiveness of justice programs and policies, and in what link, formation and mapping, they monitor patterns and trends in crime and perform sophisticated modeling and analysis on crime and criminal justice issues. And lastly data systems, they develop and maintain high quality database on crime and criminal courts and custody. Speaker 3: Excellent. [00:23:00] Also has many very rich data sets. For example, the new south Wales criminal court start-up contain all the criminal court proceedings from 1994. And that includes 3.2 million local and children's court finalizations and 95,000 at Supreme and district court trials and sentenced cases, new south Wales police stop. And that contains 17 million criminal incidents, 4 million persons of interest [00:23:30] and 14 million victims. And lastly, boxers over re-offending database, that database is particularly useful in research because the information contained in your offending history is often a significant predictor for future offending. So Foxley is an agency would have the capacity to conduct research and can at the same time help the policymakers in the criminal justice system to develop and implement strategies that can reduce crime. Speaker 3: [00:24:00] Next slide. So now I'll give you some examples of the kind of question that we ask in crime and criminal justice system. So one such question is what is the impact of the lookout walls in January, 2014, new south Wales government announced new restrictions on the licensed premises in the King's cross and seeing the CBD areas, research question associated with this policy change include the lockout law, reduce the incidents of [00:24:30] non domestic and domestic violence assaults in Kings cross and CPD. Is there any evidence of displacement to me about areas? Another question might be to develop a risk assessment tool that can actually discriminate between repeat and now repeat intimate partner violence victims, not important question is to assess the effectiveness of alternative sentencing options to full-time imprisonment. Now, one such alternative is so [00:25:00] cold and intensive correction order where an offender's served the entire sentence in the community, and that includes supervision and monitoring by community corrections. Speaker 3: And we found that intensive correction order is indeed more effective in reducing the risk of re-offending when compared to a short prison sentence of less than two years. And this results suggests that the local and the district courts across new south Wales should expand the use of intensive correction orders. [00:25:30] And a last example is a recent study looking at the impact of the COVID 19 restrictions on the different categories of crime. And this restriction is not the current restriction we are, we are in, but the one that we had in much last year, so different categories of crime, and we look at include domestic and non domestic assault, sexual assault, robbery, theft, and fraud. Now you might be the case that deprived all opportunities to commit certain types of crime. For example, burglary [00:26:00] motor vehicle theft offenders might simply reduce their criminal activity or switch to other kinds of income generating crime, such as fraud at the same time, forcing families to spend long period of time together at home might result in increase in domestic violence, but closing licensed premises and therefore reducing alcohol consumption may have the opposite effect on domestic violence. And all of these hypothesis can be tested [00:26:30] when you have access to relevant data and the skill to conduct proper data or statistical analysis. And this is the work I do as a crime statistician. Thank you. Speaker 1: Thanks very much Joanna and moving quickly on to aligner as well. So we hear about her work as a crime historian. Speaker 2: Thank you. Uh, so as mentioned, I'm a crime historian I'm sort of working at the nexus of history and criminology, or [00:27:00] as I like to explain it, asking criminological questions of historical data. So I think this sort of goes to show the importance of data and working with data I'm just as Joanna works with data. I also work with data. You've got an example there, um, on the screen of, um, uh, prison record and, you know, converting that into usable data is something that I've been sort of heavily involved in in terms of creating sort of big historical [00:27:30] data sets that we can understand long-term trends in Australian crime and criminal justice responses across time. So, you know, one project that I was involved in the prosecution project, um, did a similar thing with sort of court records. And we were able to put together a data set of, you know, half a million criminal prosecutions across the 19th and into the very late 20th centuries to analyze, you know, what were the determining factors in the outcomes [00:28:00] of prosecutions for serious crimes in Australia across time? Speaker 2: Um, uh, perhaps you won't be surprised to hear that actually one of the most important, um, if not the most important factor in those criminal prosecutions was the presence or not of defense counsel, um, today and historically at a number of people go through the criminal justice system, actually undefended, um, and you know, that [00:28:30] is a huge risk in terms of, um, likelihood of stronger likelihood of conviction and a strong likelihood of a more lengthier prison sentence, another sort of new big data project that I'm involved in at the moment. The criminal characters project is similarly taking tens of thousands into hundreds of thousands now, um, of prison records to look at offender's life histories, uh, across [00:29:00] the longterm, and to identify from that patterns in offenders, backgrounds, and life events, that impact whether, uh, how they end up their pathways into the criminal justice system and criminal offending. Speaker 2: Um, but also the likelihood of whether they will keep offending or which we refer to as recidivism or desist from crime over time. And what sort of factors employment education, um, geographical mobility [00:29:30] moving from place to place impact upon those patterns of offending. So one of the reasons if we go to the next slide, um, that I think, you know, uh, a criminology degree at UTS really makes sense is that UTS has a very strong investment in, uh, data and understanding data across the university as a whole. And data is something that I think as you might see [00:30:00] the crossword to Gyra and my discussion, um, data is something that really sits at the core of what criminologists do and understanding the causes of crime and trends and patterns in crime and evaluating how effective the criminal justice system has been. So one of the great facilities that we have at UTS is the UTS data arena. Speaker 2: Unfortunately, if we were on campus today, we'd be able to show you in person. Um, but for now, we've just got these visuals on [00:30:30] screen, but basically it's a 360 degree data visualization facility. You can go in and visualize this sort of big data, writ large, um, and, um, to understand it better and see it play out in different ways and explore it quite creatively. Um, you can also use it to create immersive scenes and experiences. And this facility isn't just used by academic researchers like myself. Um, but also industry professionals [00:31:00] have made use of it, including the new south Wales police. So on the right of this slide here, we can actually see an image from one of those nooses, um, where LIDAR scanning of scenes has been used by the police to be able to then go back in, um, and create sort of simulations of spaces to understand things like lines of sight between two different points. Um, you know, would a certain [00:31:30] event witnessed from a certain point, you know, what would have been able to be seen from that point effectively? So, you know, in terms of why UTS, I think the data and the industry connections are two really big selling points there. And with that, I'll hand back to Andrew. Speaker 1: Excellent. That's terrific. Ilana. Thank you. Uh, one of the questions that's come through in the chat there, or in the questions and answer is about industry links, uh, [00:32:00] and getting experienced for jobs. So UTS is really about one of the features or UTS model of learning is, um, connection with industry. And, uh, here, you can see, um, a picture of Nick Caldas, who is an industry professor. Who's just been appointed to the faculty of arts and social sciences, and he, uh, has an amazing background history, um, with the new south Wales police force. He was a deputy commissioner of police, but more recently he's worked a lot with the United nations in different [00:32:30] areas and has very, very fantastic connections out into our consulting and industry as well. And that's an example of the sort of person who's who's associated with the program, um, and will, there'll be opportunities for guest lecturers coming in, but in particular, I wanted to draw everyone's attention to the industry project, which happens in the final year and that's a, a large subject and there's a panel involved with that. Speaker 1: So because of the sensitivities of, of some of the [00:33:00] industries that we are, uh, dealing with, um, in criminology, uh, going out and doing an internship, uh, compulsory internship, uh, is, is not it's, it's not, um, it's not something we can do. However, we do have industry come in form a panel place, real world questions to our students, and then the students are evaluated by that panel as well. So that's an indication of, of how, uh, industry is, is linked, uh, with [00:33:30] this program. Um, not only through people like does, but also in that way with that panel and the industry project. Uh, if you do a, um, a major which has room as an elective for, for an internship, you can go and self source something perhaps in an internship, um, in industry as well. So there are possibilities for that. Um, I might just move on to the question panel here and try [00:34:00] and deal with, and answer some of the questions that you've, uh, you've raised. Speaker 1: So I'm just looking over those. Um, I've talked about industry experienced by that industry panel and also in the, in the electives. Um, uh, if you do the standard major and you want to, and are able to do it, uh, an internship, the difference, there's a question, the difference between a fright forensic science degree and a criminology forensic science major. So yes, there's that all of the core, [00:34:30] uh, criminology subjects in the criminology degree. So that's, uh, all of those ones that were up on the screen before, um, you know, introduction to criminology, uh, crime, data analysis, um, uh, research methods in the social sciences. It's, it's the social science factor and the understanding a little of the, of the complexity, uh, of, um, crime society, the law from a social sciences perspective, [00:35:00] which you don't get in a forensic science degree itself, uh, do you have to do elective subjects? Speaker 1: So there's a different answer for that, depending on which major you select, if you do a standard major over three years, there is room for electives, and yes, you would need to, if you pick an extended major then, um, depending on which one you do, there's either no room for electives, or if there's any room for electives [00:35:30] it's within the specific area of that set of that extended major. So in those, the simple is no there aren't electives. Uh, and if you do the combined degree with the bachelor of forensic science, yes, there are electives. And I talked about some of those electives, uh, that are available, um, uh, both in that combined degree, but also in the standard major. Speaker 1: Are there advantages [00:36:00] to doing a double degree of criminology combined with a forensic science, bachelor, majoring in biology? Uh, well, I think I've explained a little bit about the, the advantages of doing the double degree, uh, with forensic science in that it does offer the social sciences perspectives on criminology within the criminology half of the double degree. Um, if you want to major in biology, if you've got that background [00:36:30] in biology, biology, then I would really recommend that you seriously consider doing the double major. I sorry, the double degree with a bachelor of forensic science, because you can major in biology. That's one of the areas you can write, you don't have to, but you can, uh, I hope that answers your question, Bianca. So, um, the social sciences and the sciences coming together in the combined degree, that one is, uh, uh, a question [00:37:00] now, uh, which degree would be better for career in forensic science, the bachelor of forensic science or the double degree. Speaker 1: So criminology and forensic science. Well, I would say if you're interested in forensic science, um, adjust in, in, uh, uh, from, uh, from that sort of more scientific point of view, then the single degree, but the double degree gives you the added social science, uh, approach, and would mark you out as being, um, [00:37:30] uh, distinguished from people who only have a forensic science single degree. So it's an extra year at university, but it does give you a distinction in, in the job market. And that's, uh, it gives you the, the, the different approach as well, but it also gives you that distinction in a job market. So that's something that you might like to consider the same goes for any of the double degrees. So I'm doing the bachelor of international studies and the, uh, the bachelor of criminology [00:38:00] would also distinguish you in the market. Speaker 1: And that's something you might like to consider as well. I gave that example of, of the student with a background, uh, with the police force and how it was incredibly useful for her, uh, for her work with the police doing the bachelor of arts in international studies. If I, I'm just wondering if, when you, if, whether you could do an exchange in the UK for criminology. So yes, if you do a [00:38:30] standard major in criminology, um, you do an exchange that's that's possible, uh, and there might be possibilities also in, in the combined degree with forensic science to, uh, the best way of getting overseas to a country where one of those six languages is spoken is, is doing the double degree, but there are opportunities, as I say, for, uh, doing an exchange within that, um, the double degree [00:39:00] with international studies or within, uh, the standard major bachelor of criminology, uh, what major would be most appropriate to working, uh, for the AFP more specifically in the field? Um, that's really hard to say because the IFP sort of has, um, you know, works over the very, uh, large jurisdiction as well. Um, I might ask my panel though, whether they might have any particular insights [00:39:30] into that. Um, uh, Joanna, is there anything you might say or Allana, Speaker 2: Like, I think, you know, as you sort of indicated, it would probably depend on the sort of role that you would want to have with the AFP. Like if you were interested in crime scene investigation, obviously, um, forensic science would appear appropriate if you're interested in cybersecurity and working on technical aspects, um, that, uh, that major would be, uh, appropriate. Um, I would say again, like the data [00:40:00] analytics, um, major would, uh, you know, fit you for certain roles within the AFP. Um, Joanna, did you have, Speaker 3: Depending on the role? Um, yeah. Speaker 1: Uh, okay. So to be answered on Zune, what's your favorite part of the, of, of the degree? Well, the degree is brand new, so that's pretty exciting for me that it's, it's, um, it's being launched. And, uh, uh, I guess [00:40:30] for me, the idea of that industry project is really exciting, uh, where the panel comes in and, uh, and you get that real life, real authentic, uh, questions, real-world questions coming, which you have to have to work towards. Um, so that to me is a really exciting part of the degree. Uh, also the combinations, you know, with forensic science and, and, um, with the international studies, which as I said at the start as my, my own background. So, um, I would like to get in [00:41:00] intelligence and investigation. Uh, what steps should I follow? Well, I think probably, probably some of the, some of the questions we've already answered, Mike might give an answer to that. Um, depends really what, what sort of areas you're interested in, I think, um, and whether you follow a particular, uh, one of those standard majors or, or extended majors, Allana is talking an answer to that. So [00:41:30] maybe she's able to continue. Speaker 2: I was just going to say the data analytics, um, if you're sort of not sure what you want to do, but you want to be prepared for, um, or to have it just sort of distinction from just the sort of standard criminology, the data analytics could be a good option there if you're not sort of immediately attracted to either the digital or the, um, crime scene investigation. Um, [00:42:00] because I think that the, those data analytics skills are going to set you apart, um, but also be highly relevant to the field work and different areas as well. Speaker 1: Thanks, Alanna, uh, Nicola question, if you didn't study chemistry and only standard maths, can you be offered placement in the course? So if you've got, um, two units of English, then you can, uh, you can study the standard major, uh, if [00:42:30] you do the standard criminology, uh, can you major in, uh, forensic science? Uh, yes, there is a forensics, um, uh, forensic major standard major within the standard within the bachelor of criminology. Yes. Uh, the next question, sorry, I'm racing through those a bit as we're about to run out of time, um, prerequisites for criminology, uh, and international studies combined degree. Uh, so there's no, um, the, [00:43:00] the, the prerequisites for the criminology degree, uh, other ones that we've mentioned, there are no prerequisites for the international studies part of the degree. Uh, for example, you don't need to, um, uh, you don't need to already have language skills. Speaker 1: You can start as a beginner, but you can also, if you speak French already, um, you've done it at school, then we can also accommodate that. So that's no problems. Um, can you just apply for criminology and enter the combined degree, [00:43:30] uh, if desired, yes, that should be possible via an internal cost transfer. So, no worries. Um, when do you apply for the bridging courses please? Um, uh, I'm not able to answer that question, Nicola. I suspect you might be asking about specific bridging courses and so forth. It might be easier if you go to the UTS, uh, um, uh, open day site and seek some specific, uh, advice, [00:44:00] uh, from admissions, um, uh, about your question that might be the easiest, um, next question to become a crime scene investigator that double degree of forensic science and criminology is best. Well, you can do crime scene investigation, um, within, uh, the, the standard degree. Speaker 1: That's no problems, uh, as a subject, uh, if you pick one of the standard majors, um, but I think if you've got a [00:44:30] real passion for it, I'd, I'd say go for the doubled grade that only adds an extra year, and it gives you that distinction in the market, and you've got the whole extra degree. Um, what sort of careers would the criminology forensic science degree be most useful for? Well, I think I've sort of answered that already. Um, yeah, you know, a crime scene investigator would, would, would be a classic one. Uh, but you know, there are also forensics, [00:45:00] um, uh, you know, con consultancies and so forth that I did. I spoke about when I talked about some of the, um, uh, consulting firms that have also had forensics departments. Um, if I dropped a side subject, but did it in year 11, is that okay? Speaker 1: Um, uh, Dahlia, I think it depends, uh, what, whether you're interested in doing one of the, uh, extended majors, um, or indeed the double [00:45:30] degree with forensic science, it might be easiest for you to ask, uh, you know, a specific question, um, of, of the chat in the open day. But what I would say is that, uh, you don't need to have done, um, uh, uh, science in order to do this, this, uh, standard majors of the criminology degrees. So the basic bachelor of criminology degree, but if you're asking about one of the combined [00:46:00] degrees or extended majors, I think, um, we can give you more specific answers. If you ask your, you know, ask you a question against the background of your own study history, we've gone over time. So I'm aware that probably people need to go off to other things. And I'd just like to say, thank you very much. Speaker 1: We've got through all of the questions, which is amazing where a little bit after 11, I'd like to say, thank you very much to everyone for participating to my panelists, Allana Joanna, Serena behind the scenes, [00:46:30] uh, to all of, all of the students, prospective students, parents, and others. Thank you very much for coming along. Good luck with the rest of your studies this year. And we very much hope to see next year or the year after, perhaps depending on what you're, you're doing this year here at UTS doing what about criminology degrees? So thank you very much and goodbye. Led by Dr Nick Manganas, find out more about this highly popular combined international studies degree. With a number of new options for commencing students, see how this degree can suit you. Speaker 1: Okay. I think we can, um, begin now, uh, good morning, uh, everyone, uh, I'd first like to begin by acknowledging the Gadigal people of the sorry of the Eora nation upon whose ancestral lands. Um, our city campus at UTS now stands, and I would like to pay respects to the elders both, both past and present acknowledging them as the traditional custodians for this land. And I would further like to acknowledge [00:00:30] the traditional custodians called the various ancestral lands from which our other attendees join us today and to pay respects to those elders past and present. So welcome to today's session. Um, on the bachelor of international studies, it's a real honor for me to present this flagship degree at UTS. So it's a program, uh, that has been going for more than 25 years. And the bachelor of international studies is a unique offering, [00:01:00] um, in both Australia and also internationally. Speaker 1: So it's a globally regarded, uh, degree. Um, um, and this is because, um, it assists in developing students' intercultural skills, language proficiency, and can also equip students to become critical cosmopolitan citizens who can operate successfully in diverse professional contexts, um, and also internationally. Um, so my name is Nick, Dr. Nick McGinnis. I'm [00:01:30] a lecture, a senior lecturer in international studies, and I'm also the course coordinator of this degree. And I'd also like to introduce to you Holly Johnston. So Holly completed her bachelor of international studies just a little while ago. And she's also here to provide you, um, a little bit of feedback about her experience during this degree at UTS. Uh, Holly, would you like to quickly introduce yourself? Speaker 2: Hi everyone. I'm Holly. I graduated from a bachelor of communications [00:02:00] and international studies in November of last year. Um, and straight after my degree, I got a job working for the department of premier and cabinet, uh, for the new south Wales government. So I'm hoping to sort of give you guys a bit of an insight into certain career opportunities, as well as, um, all the great fun that you'll have doing an international studies degree. Speaker 1: Thanks so much, Holly. All right. So, uh, I suppose we kind of begin by, you know, the, you know, by pointing out [00:02:30] that most students that choose an international studies degree are very keen about having an international experience. Uh, so I suppose the question is, do you feel that you are missing out on travel in 2022 and, uh, um, a lot of Australians feel that way, uh, because of the pandemic. Um, and, but despite this, uh, international studies degrees like ours have been attracting, um, increasing amounts of students. So the idea I suppose, is that since many young, since many [00:03:00] young Australians have been missing out on travel, then why not integrate, um, an international study experience in your degree in order to be able to go and travel. Um, you know, when the, the global situation has calmed down a little bit. So I suppose this is one of the key reasons that, that students choose an international studies degree. Speaker 1: This it's much more than that also. So let's just have a look at some [00:03:30] of the key reasons, and then we can get Holly's opinion as well. So, first of all, UTS prides itself in having developed what we consider an enviable model, um, that has achieved an international reputation. Um, I, myself also studied, uh, international studies at UTS and more than 20 years later, I'm now, uh, the program coordinator. Um, but I wouldn't have been able to do it, uh, if it wasn't for the dedicated academic and professional staff at UTS that carefully scaffold [00:04:00] intercultural learning, um, and ensure that you are prepared for your international experience. Um, and the great thing about studying international studies studies at UTS is that it's a combined degree. So you can combine it with 29 different undergraduate degrees across UTS, including, um, with degrees, for example, from law, uh, business and communication. Uh, Holly, can you quickly say what you combined your international studies degree with? Yeah, Speaker 2: So I combined it with, [00:04:30] uh, communications, majoring in social and political sciences. It was a really good combination, but, um, everyone across the course did a range of different degrees, which I found was actually really nice to be able to meet people from different disciplines and it actually made sort of the assignments and the discussions in class a lot more interesting as well. Speaker 1: Cool, thank you, uh, pilot, um, and another, um, I suppose, uh, highlight of international studies at UTS is that it provides you flexible [00:05:00] ways of being able to integrate travel into your degree. So for example, there is the possibility of undertaking a full year overseas, uh, for those students who would like that. But for students who might prefer a shorter stay, uh, there's also the possibility of doing a six month, um, study abroad overseas, and for some students, um, even, um, just a few weeks. And if there are students, for example, that just wants to gain all of these intercultural skills are without leaving home. [00:05:30] Uh, there is also now the option of doing the whole degree based in Sydney. Uh, but most importantly, the bachelor of international studies is a flagship program for us, um, because students gain the much sought after, uh, project management skills, uh, that employers require as well as a soft skills such as resilience. Um, and this ensures that you're kind of competitive in the job market. Um, Holly, perhaps you'd like to talk a little bit about your project and the skills that you gained. [00:06:00] Yeah, so Speaker 2: I did the full year, um, overseas, I went to Granada in Spain and I had the opportunity to really explore my personal interests while I was there and complete a project. So I combine my two interests, which are like, um, social policy and welfare with environmental policy. And I was able to work with Nick while I was over there to develop a research project that looked into energy, poverty, um, which is related to people who don't have like sufficient, um, [00:06:30] energy wealth in order to sort of stay warm, stay comfortable and actually live a proper life in their homes. Um, so I conducted a major study over that, into that, into the national policy at the time, um, and how that related to my specific city and if it met the needs of the people. Speaker 1: Yeah, thanks so much, Holly. Uh, and these skills, uh, that I've mentioned, uh, students gain them almost immediately. So our research has shown that when our UTS students, uh, arrived back [00:07:00] at UTS after their international experience, um, that marks, um, a much higher than, um, other students in their professional degree. So you get, um, uh, marks boost, uh, upon your return. Um, and that also helps you stand out in the job market as well. So in an international studies degree at UTS, you can learn a language. And at UTS, we have the six, I suppose, most popular languages to study in Australia, and they are French, Japanese, Chinese, [00:07:30] Italian, um, Spanish and German. And as I, as I mentioned, that employers are always telling us, um, that intercultural skills, um, are considered by them as a central force for a global career. And at UTS, um, we carefully prepare students using what we call a pack model. So P for preparation aid for adaptation C for consolidation. So we prepare students for an international experience. Uh, you have academic [00:08:00] staff in order to help you adapt to your international experience. Um, and then you can consolidate your knowledge in, in capstone projects or through internships. Speaker 1: So I just want to talk a little bit about, um, how our degree is is structured. Um, so if you, uh, join a bachelor of international studies with us from 2022, you have three different options. [00:08:30] So you can, for example, choose the first option, which is language culture, and the professional world. Now this option is ideal for students who would prefer to do it all or most of their subjects here in Sydney. Um, it does include an intern, an internship at an international organization, um, and it does include the option of also doing a study abroad experience of between two and six weeks. Uh, for those students who are a little bit more adventurous, we have, uh, [00:09:00] the second option, which is which we call language, culture and global exchange. Now with this option, um, you will also do an internship in an international organization, but you also do a six month global exchange, um, any UTS partner university. Speaker 1: So we have, uh, options that are over 200 partner universities. Um, and I think at the moment is 42 countries and territories. And from 2022, um, were really excited to announce [00:09:30] that we have, um, an international honors in this degree. So this means, um, international honors students will do a full year, uh, a relevant overseas partner university that aligns with their language choice. So this means you can do your international honors in either Germany, France, Spain, Italy, uh, Japan, or China, and the students will also receive a handsome contribution from UTS to assist with their travel [00:10:00] experiences. Um, Holly, can you please talk about the option that you did and what your experience was like? Speaker 2: Yes, I did. What is now the honors, um, and did a one year in city of Granada in Spain. It was like, obviously just the best year. Um, it was really great opportunity to, so before going overseas, our UTS prepared you through, um, Spanish language classes. I had no prior experience, but I was able to do two years of Spanish language classes prior, move over and then really get to practice [00:10:30] the language, make vocals. Um, it was a challenging experience, but also super rewarding. Um, I think one of the best spots did you get a proper university experience by being an exchange student and you get to really be part of a university culture and meet other young people from all over the world at the same time as doing, um, like I got to choose some really interesting subjects over there, um, as well as completing my research. So you get a bit of fun and travel as well as, um, developing some really key skills that get you a job after. Speaker 1: [00:11:00] Thanks so much, Holly. And I just want to point out that the exciting thing about the honors program at UTS, uh, is that it's only embedded on us. So this means it does not require an additional year on top of your degree. So this means that, um, it takes the same amount of semesters as the other options as well. Um, but as it is, uh, an honors degree, uh, in order to enter into the honors degree, you will be required to have and maintain a credit average. [00:11:30] Um, and I suppose I should have pointed out that just in case, um, uh, there's another, I suppose, global pandemic or any other, uh, difficult situation in the future. Uh, all students will be, um, able to, uh, return to the first option, the stay at home option in case there's any disruption to international travel. I just want to now, um, explain to you a little bit about, uh, what it would look like for you. Speaker 1: Um, if you study international studies at UTS, [00:12:00] so I'm going to go through two different sample plans. So the one that you can see on your screen at the moment is for example, a student that chooses to do the six months global exchange. So sorry. Uh, and so, but what would it look like? So for example, in year one, uh, you will mostly be doing professional subjects. So this means, uh, the subjects of your professional degree. So remember you're always doing international studies, uh, with one of those other 29 degrees. Uh, but you will [00:12:30] also do a sub international studies subject called intercultural communication. In your second year, you begin to mix your international studies subjects a lot with your professional degree. So for student, you will do to language and culture subjects or your chosen language, and you will also study a subject called contemporary society, um, that links with the language that you're doing. Speaker 1: So you might do contemporary Spain or contemporary Italy, or contemporary, France, et cetera. [00:13:00] And in the third year, you will continue to learn your language, um, as well as your subjects in your professional degree. And in the fourth year, um, you would complete a subject called international research methods. Uh, you'll be able to go on global exchange to, uh, one of those 200 or so universities, um, use it doing elective subjects. And upon your return, you'll be able to do a, an internship at [00:13:30] an international organization in a subject called the global professional industry engagement project. Um, and then in your final year, uh, you will complete your professional degree. So it's a well-rounded five-year degree now, holiday to the second option, which I'm going to show you down. Um, and this is the embedded honors. And as you can see, it is quite similar. Speaker 1: So you still do mostly your professional degree subjects in your first year, plus the subjects, [00:14:00] intercultural communication, um, sorry. Uh, you do contemporary society in your language subjects in the second year, continue with your language and culture subjects in the third year. Uh, but in your fourth year, you spend your whole year overseas, just like holidays in the city of Granada in Spain, uh, where you complete a subject called international research methods. And you also complete, um, this is our in country study one and in country study chain where [00:14:30] you are studying in a different university, um, as well as completing, uh, an honors level research project under the supervision of a UTS academic, and then in your fifth year, uh, you are studying your professional subjects. Speaker 1: So a key question that many students always ask us is where can I go? So global exchange, uh, is, uh, it's a large program at UTS. Uh, we have many, many students that choose to [00:15:00] go on global exchange and we currently have more than 42 different countries and territories, including, uh, more than 200 universities that you can choose from, um, in all continents, in terms of the international honors here, you have six choices. So the students that choose this option can either go to China, to France, to Germany, to Japan, to Italy, or to Spain. So depending on what you choose, you will be studying that language. You [00:15:30] will spend a year at a university in that city, and you will also be working one-on-one with a relevant, specialized academic on that country. Um, just like Holly, for example, was, was working with me, um, on Spain because I'm a spending specialist. Uh, Holly, how did you find that one-on-one experience working with an academic staff member? Speaker 2: Um, obviously I'm talking to you, but I really, really, um, it was much better than I sort of anticipated. It would be, it [00:16:00] really gives you an opportunity that you don't get in other university subjects to sort of develop a relationship and actually be able to explore your personal interests with someone who gets to know you well. So Nick and I would send a lot of emails back and forth as I was exploring the city and exploring what concepts and ideas I wanted to, um, explore in my research. Um, and I was given plenty of time to do that and plenty of time to consider. And there was a number of challenges that were met throughout the progress of the research. And [00:16:30] Nick was able to support me. Sometimes I just send an email being like this has happened. I don't know what to do. And you like, all these things change. Um, it was a number of changes in my research topic at the time. And you are really sort of supported, um, both mentally and academically through the whole process, um, which I think is a real sort of Testament TTS that they provide you that proper support throughout the whole year. Yeah. Speaker 1: Thanks so much, Holly. And it must be difficult to say that while you're speaking to me. Okay. So we do [00:17:00] have, um, we have Holly here obviously is talking about her experience, but we do have student blogs and you can see the website there on the screen. So you can, um, hop onto that website and look at the experiences of, um, uh, recent graduates of, um, international studies, um, in all of the different majors, not just in Spain. So you can look at perhaps, uh, different countries, for example, in Japan or in Italy, for example, and look at what students did, what their experience was like [00:17:30] and how it was very life-changing for them. All right. So Holly's already been, um, speaking to us about her experience, but perhaps Holly, would you mind, I'm sorry, outlining to the participants of this seminar, uh, what your career trajectory was like and how mean to national studies degree helped you? Speaker 2: Well, I, when I started my degree, I really had no idea what I wanted to do. I kind of just [00:18:00] picked this degree because it was interesting and it blind with my passions and I wanted to go on an exchange. Um, but it gave me so much more than I expected while I was so in my fourth year, I still didn't really know what I wanted to do career wise, but when I was in Spain, it became really clear to me. Um, and that was through that sort of mentorship opportunity that I discovered that, um, it's actually public policy is my passion and something that I'm really, um, I'm interested in. So I was able to sort of discover that while overseas, um, which I know a number [00:18:30] of other students have as well. Um, so I pursued a research topic that was relevant to public policy. Speaker 2: And then, um, upon completing my degree, I was able to apply for jobs in the government sector and, um, was pretty quickly successful because I was able to sort of talk about in interviews. My, um, I actually only did one, uh, in-person interview and got the job. So, um, that was good. I able to talk about my experience in Spain in the interview and talk [00:19:00] about, uh, the research that I conducted and I think it was, um, quite respected. And as a result, I've now got a job as an assistant advisor for the cabinet team in new south Wales government. So at the moment I work on, um, public policy in the department of planning industry and environment, which is my personal interest. And I also work on cabinet meetings and national cabinet coordination as well. Um, which does have a bit of that sort of international focus. And I [00:19:30] tied a lot of the stuff that I want in my international studies degree. Um, and I'm going to continue to pursue a career in this direction, and there's so many opportunities and it's really nice to have a degree behind me that gives me those skills that I know I can use at work every day Speaker 1: And holiday, just very quickly. The last question, do you think that employers value students that have intercultural skills and an international study abroad experience? Yeah, I definitely Speaker 2: Think so. Um, just looking at my team, um, at work, we're a very [00:20:00] young team and I would say majority of people, maybe 80% have done it overseas exchange. Um, international studies is probably the most popular degree across people in my workplace. Um, and it's very, um, well-respected, and I also, not only the sort of perception of it, I think that for me, it really was a maturing experience, um, and helped me sort of get clarity and, you know, I have a really good time of assays, but also come home and reflect and have that sort of clarity about what I want to do and, [00:20:30] um, what my passions are and what I want to do with my life. And I think that really helps me to then step forward and take that next step and get a job and, um, the suit of Korean. Speaker 1: Thanks so much, Holly. Um, and I, we happy to now take questions from, from the audience. Okay. So I see, um, a question about whether it helps to have done a couple of languages for the HSC, for example, Japanese and Spanish. [00:21:00] Um, it doesn't necessarily help because, um, in international studies at UTS, you can start with no language experience. So if you haven't done a language experience at all, that's not a problem. You'll just start at the introductory level one. If you do have a language experience, for example, say even the HSC or, um, or in, or in other places, that's fine as well. So you would speak with the language coordinator in the school of international studies, um, [00:21:30] and they perhaps will do a brief level test and they will put you in the rad, the right level for you. So you perhaps you might not start at level one, but you might start at level three or level four, and then continue just looking at the question. So first similar second one. Yes. So there's another question about, you have to learn a whole new language. So the answer is, yes, you do need to learn one of those six languages as part of the international studies degree. Speaker 1: [00:22:00] Um, yes. Again, so learning a language is, is a compulsory part of the degree. I think I answered the question for the person who's done Italian beginners. You would be able to begin, um, at the level that's appropriate for you. Someone asks, do you get to choose which language you learn? Um, yes. So we have the six options and you can definitely [00:22:30] choose whichever one of those six you're interested in. And we also a question about whether you can go to Latin America for the six months exchange. Uh, yes, of course we have, uh, partner relationships in, in many, uh, Latin American universities, including in chiller in Argentina and Columbia, in Costa Rica, in Mexico, as well as others. Speaker 1: [00:23:00] There's also a question about what's the difference between a global exchange for six months. Um, and also I suppose the, the international honors degree. So the global exchange means that you have more options of where to go. Um, but obviously the period that you study overseas 46 months instead of the full year, but with the global exchange, you will only be doing elective subjects. So it basically you'll be able to go to one of those 200 plus [00:23:30] universities, um, and you will be able to choose, uh, the subjects you will, you want to study. Um, and you'll be able to do that because they are your elective subjects with international honors degree. Um, you are expected to continue to improve your language proficiency, um, and by the second semester, because it's because it's a whole year, you will be doing art subjects in the target language and the language you've been studying, um, as well, [00:24:00] you will also be working on your honors level project at the same time, uh, throughout the four years. So it's a very intense, yeah. Did you find it very intense? Um, Holly, Speaker 2: Um, I found learning, um, classes at the Spanish university quite intense, but I will say that, uh, UTS really does support you through that and understands if, um, like I know I struggled with some of my subjects, um, and UTS were very supportive, very understanding of, okay, maybe that class was a bit too hard. We don't expect [00:24:30] you to be able to write, um, a couple of essays in an exam. So, um, I wouldn't stress too much about that. Um, I really focused on doing well in my honors project because that was really a worthwhile thing. And I was able to also just pick subjects that were a bit of fun when I was there. So I did like, um, Latin American film and women in history and sort of subjects that were just aligned to my personal interests. Um, so it wasn't too stressful of an experience and there's still plenty of time to potty and have a good time. Speaker 1: [00:25:00] Yeah. Um, there's also a question about, uh, whether it's a bachelor's degree. Yes, of course. It's a, it's a bachelor's degree. Um, so remember when we say to combined degree at UTS, so you will be doing it with another degree at the same time. So for example, law or business, for example, so this means you graduate with two bachelor's degrees. Um, and there's also a question about what, uh, why it's now called a bachelor of international studies instead of a bachelor of arts and international studies. [00:25:30] Uh, there's absolutely no difference. Um, we have changed the name, uh, basically basically because in order to make it shorter, um, and we think that employers and students prefer the shorter name, but there's absolutely no difference at all. Um, so I think Holly answered the question about how much time you have overseas. So you do get definitely support the students, get time to have fun there, to travel, et cetera. Speaker 2: Yeah, I did four and a half months in my year of just traveling in between semesters. [00:26:00] So there's plenty of time to move around. Like I just traveled all over Europe, um, in between semesters. So you don't need to worry about that. Speaker 1: Uh, there's also, uh, the costs involved with global exchange. Um, obviously this depends, this depends on, uh, where you decide to go because the cost of living is different. Um, and if you want to go, for example, to a major city in a Western country, the costs can be significant. On the other hand, if you go to a more provincial [00:26:30] smaller city, the cost can be much lower. Um, there are also S help loans. So these are loans that the government gives to students in order to help them with the expenses of, um, of going overseas. Uh, Holly, do you wanna talk a little bit about what the expenses were like? Speaker 2: Um, so I picked Granada, which was the Southern, um, city in Spain, which was quite affordable. That was one of the reasons I picked it. I didn't want any sort of financial stress, um, and it was really affordable [00:27:00] way cheaper than Sydney. Um, so it was quite easy to just stick to budget and not spend too much money. Um, but I know people in some of the biggest cities were fine as well. You get, you can get up to about $14,000 added to your help, um, loan from the government towards the year. I would suggest like saving up your own money at the same time, like while you study. Um, but you've got plenty of financial support and UTS also helps, um, with a little bit of money as well, which is good. Speaker 1: Thanks, Holly. [00:27:30] Um, there's a quick question about whether the degree has changed on the UX side. It should be changed. Um, this is a recent change of the name and it should be done by on the UX side as well. Um, there's a question about whether an international studies degree helps you get a job in a global corporation, um, organization, for example, such as the UN um, yes, definitely. And if you go to our website, we had our 25 year, um, um, anniversary of the degree just a couple of years ago, and [00:28:00] we highlight 25 different students in their career paths. So that's would be, um, I think interesting reading for students interested in this degree. There's also a question about whether you can stay on campus while you're overseas, or whether you ability with a family, um, for the one-year exchange. Uh, yes, this is possible. Speaker 1: So when students, um, students put in their preferences for the different universities in, in a partner country, and while [00:28:30] students negotiate those preferences with their major coordinator, um, they're also given, um, explanations and information about the different accommodation options. Now, most UTS students choose to just, uh, rent an apartment or, or do share accommodation because that ends up being, I think the cheapest option, uh, but, or, well, most universities have student accommodation and most universities also have a service in order to be able to bill that students with, [00:29:00] um, with a family, a local family. Uh, Holly, what about your cohort? Did, did any students do that or were they all living in shared accommodation? I'm not, Speaker 2: I didn't know anyone that did in Spain. I don't think, um, not, not on any of my friends across Spain, but I just did a, um, got an apartment for myself and lived with, um, some other girls from across Germany, France and Spain, um, in a share house. And it was a real, real good [00:29:30] time and it was quite easy to just find my own apartment. And if you it's, cause it's a lot of the places, the university towns, so there's plenty of demand for students to just rent a room, um, and you can get really nice apartments, um, and have that sort of like independence. You can have parties and things at your place like Ross is being on campus or that sort of thing, but there's plenty of options depending on what your preferred. Speaker 1: Yeah. And Holly, there was a question I think is, is important about a student who, uh, was [00:30:00] asking you how you found being, studying a Spanish language at a Spanish university with just a few years of language learning at UTS. Speaker 2: Um, I think that if I had been a bit of a better student at UTS, um, I would've been a bit easier, but, um, it's pretty, you can pick it up pretty quick once you're in the country as well, because you're just exposed to it every single day. So, um, I also had the opportunity while in my first semester in Spain, uh, UTS had language courses as well. So in [00:30:30] my first semester, it depends on the university you go to, but I did, um, two days a week of Spanish classes while I was in Spain still and got an accreditation from that as well as doing just one, you know, normal university course class, which, um, was perfectly fine to pass because I had the two years of UTS Spanish experience plus learning Spanish while in Spain speaking. And every day you very quickly can just sort of adapt. And, um, the university [00:31:00] was quite understanding too, that, you know, it's not your first language, they don't expect perfect grammar or any of that sort of stuff. Um, so yeah, it was perfect. It was very good. Speaker 1: Excellent. And just very quickly two last questions. So one, um, there's a question about whether this degree can help, uh, with a career in hotel management. Um, that's a definite yes, because the focus of this degree is on intercultural skills. Um, and that's something that the large hotels, uh, are especially keen on and looking for, um, in the people [00:31:30] that they hire. And the last question is about w what's the difference between an international studies degree and a global studies degree. Now a global studies degree, um, as you can see from, from the word global is about studying the global system, right? So that includes global processes. For example, things like, uh, globalization, uh, globalization of the economy, governments, um, the economy, et cetera. So it's looking, um, on a macro [00:32:00] level, um, uh, about the, the global system and international studies degree is more about the intercultural skills. Speaker 1: It's more about you, uh, developing the capacity to, um, to understand, uh, coaches, um, and you do that through a very deep study of one particular language and one particular society. Um, and so you, so you, international studies focuses on the language learning, uh, it focuses on, uh, you being able to communicate [00:32:30] well with people from other cultures. Um, and yeah, so, and although you do, or it does also encompass some of the international processes, it's more about, uh, you know, focus on one particular region or one particular society. Another question just came through, so when are you overseas? And you're expected to do all your exams in that language. Um, so yes, in the international [00:33:00] honors, when you're out at university, you do them in the language. Um, it depends on the language you were doing as well. So for example, if you're studying Japanese or Chinese, um, from zero, uh, you will mainly be doing art language learning, um, when you're doing your, um, international honors. So we don't expect you to be writing full on essays in Japanese or Chinese, whereas in the European languages students managed to do so. Um, but your [00:33:30] honors project is written in English. So you don't need to write your UTS assignments in the language. You will be doing that in English question for Holly. Did you find the accent in Granada hard to understand? Speaker 2: Yes, I did. Um, but it was a little bit of fun. I mean, we started speaking with the accent. Um, so I don't know, it was a bit of a little bit of a challenge, but also a bit of fun too. And you felt like you were really part of Granada and part of the Andalusian accent, which was, uh, a nice thing I think. Yeah. Yeah. Speaker 1: Yeah. [00:34:00] Thanks. And very quickly for that quick question, before the other question about where the English or the language, if you do the global exchange for six months, you can choose, uh, English language subjects, um, at that host university, if you feel you're not confident enough to, to study in the language that you are studying for the honors, you do need to study overseas in the language. Speaker 2: But like I said, don't worry too much about that. Um, UTS designs, the course that you can, like, I did start with [00:34:30] nothing in the language and gradually build up the skills and go over and you'll, you'll be fine. Everyone. I don't know anyone that didn't, um, uh, based in Spain that didn't do well, everyone was completely fine. So it's designed that you'll be okay with that. Speaker 1: Okay. I think we have answered all of your questions. Um, it's been a pleasure for us. I really want to extend a huge thank you to Holly for joining us this morning and taking the time out of her day to answer these questions for you. Uh, we hope we've [00:35:00] covered, uh, everything you wanted to know. Um, you can still ask questions after the session, right. There are, um, UTS is always open for questions. So please, um, you know, getting, get in touch with us and we hope to see you, uh, beginning your international study subjects with us next year. So have a good day, everyone. Thanks. Led by Dr Kristine Aquino, learn about this important and ground-breaking interdisciplinary sustainability and environment degree. Discover how to balance an understanding of a key area of professional practice and how it relates to Sustainability. Speaker 1: So hi everyone. Um, so before we do start, uh, I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation upon who's a test or a lens I'm presenting from, and as well where the UTS city campus now sense I'd like to pay respect to the elders both past and present acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land. So welcome to open date. We're excited to introduce this new [00:00:30] combined degree offering at UTS, the bachelor of sustainability and environment. My name is Dr. Christina Kinara, and I'm the degree coordinator. And joining me in this presentation is professor Kate Buckley, who is part of the core teaching team. So the bachelor of sustainability and environment is a combined degree that can be taken with a bachelor of science, the bachelor of health, the bachelor of business, the bachelor of economics and the bachelor of management. [00:01:00] So in this brief presentation, we'll discuss what this new degree is about and why we think you should study sustainability here with us at UTS. Speaker 1: So the bachelor of sustainability and environment engages with the big issue of our time, the sustainable future of our societies and our planet. So how do we limit global warming to Ballou two degrees? [00:01:30] How do we make cities more sustainable? How do we reduce land and water pollution? For example, there are over 5 trillion plastic pieces flirting in the open ocean together weighing up to nearly 300,000 tons, which get into the fish. We eat and kill Marine mammals and seabirds who mistake it for food equally important. How do we broaden the notion of environmental sustainability to better achieve gender equality, [00:02:00] social solidarity, and intergenerational equity. So these big questions have to be addressed in the here and now we need to start connecting, um, how these grand challenges, what these grand challenges mean for us. So for global warming, for example, how can we influence our governments to take action against climate change causes such as fossil fuel industries and impacts such as Bush fires, despite scientific and economic uncertainty [00:02:30] for building a sustainable city? What can we do to better balance environment, the environmental benefits of urbanization with its challenges, such as small Guinea increase traffic congestion, and then for the issue of cultural sustainability, what are the ways to improve participation from the most marginalized, for example, indigenous people in local development activities, and how can we do better to recognize that they are leaders are rights holders and decision-makers, [00:03:00] and finally, to reduce the amount of plastic sending up in the ocean, how can consumers and businesses do better to reduce plastic use and increase recycling. Speaker 2: This degree ends to meet these challenges ahead, particularly the demand for sustainability related expertise. Once government mandates sweeping sustainability initiatives, they'll have to rapidly scale up to meet demand. This degree will equip you with the knowledge, skills, and resources [00:03:30] to meet that demand. And at UTS, we believe what future experts this would require is multidisciplinary grounding research suggests that people with single discipline training, working in sustainability struggle with the complexity of sustainability in practice, especially the mix of social business and biophysical study than the United nations sustainable development goals, which are on the slide. The STGs show, the breadth and complexity of sustainability. [00:04:00] None of these things can be achieved in isolation from the others. For example, STG three on good health and wellbeing is underpinned by STGs one and two, the eradication of poverty and hunger. And it's also an underpinned by SDG six, providing clean water and sanitation for all these goals. Speaker 2: Plus many of the others such as seven, delivering affordable and clean energy, 12 enabling responsible consumption and production and 16 enabling strong [00:04:30] institutions that espouse peace and justice, which relate to seven, 12, and 16. They all combined to make possible STG 11, sustainable cities and communities and achieving all of those goals needed to address the, to address the social inequalities around gender race and the divide between rich and poor, which are STGs five and 10. And so it's significant to point out here as well, that the term environment in the degree name, sustainability [00:05:00] and environment, doesn't just relate to the natural environment and associated issues like climate change, but rather it's defined in broad terms to include social, cultural and political environment. The complexity of all of this is very challenging, but experience shows that trying to tackle these problems. One by one doesn't work, sustainability is about bringing together knowledge about people, cultures, politics, together with knowledge about the environment, resources [00:05:30] and the atmosphere, as well as engineering and innovation and using this integrated knowledge to improve our present and to plan our future. Speaker 1: So studying sustainability and environmental UTS means you will balance depth in an area of professional practice with the multidisciplinary knowledge needed to drive change. So this degree to add value and specialization on sustainability [00:06:00] to your professional degree. And part of this experience will include engaging with organizations and industry experts, experts across a range of sectors and different communities throughout your studies to address and gain experience tackling real world problems related to sustainable development. And so by the end, you will have gained practical, essential skills in problem solving data gathering and analysis, design thinking, project [00:06:30] management, stakeholder engagement, and communication in your studio subjects. Speaker 1: So in more detail, the bachelor of sustainability can be combined with the following degrees, bachelor of science, bachelor of health, bachelor of business, bachelor of management and bachelor of economics completing the combined degrees will involve four years of full-time study or eight years part-time. So it really does just add one extra year to your professional [00:07:00] degree. It's a comprehensive yet flexible study plan. So you'll complete 96 credit points required in your chosen professional degree. And then another 96 credit points in the bachelor of sustainability and environment, which will comprise of core compulsory subjects. And then a range of subjects that you can choose from in four key streams of industry governance, science, and society. So the bachelor of sustainability is designed to be complimentary to your professional [00:07:30] degree, science, health, business, economics, and management. These are fields that are entangled with the challenges of sustainability and who each play a vital role in navigating future solutions. Speaker 2: The core subjects are comprised of two first year introductory introductory subjects. The first is sustainability in context, which will introduce you to the different meanings and applications of the concept [00:08:00] of sustainability, the environmental, social, cultural, economic, and political from the get-go. We'll encourage you to think multidimensionally and critically about the various aspects of sustainability, how different priorities interact and come into conflict or create synergies. You'll be given foundations in written analysis, critical reading and group work at the same time, strengthening skills and communication and intercultural competence that are required for the why. Why does sustainability degree [00:08:30] the second introductory unit, which is called arguments evidence and intuition will introduce you to foundational approaches to data literacy, how to collect data, read data, and use it as supporting evidence specifically. It provides you with training on how to you use data to construct a new narrative, or to tell a story, pitching a sustainability solution to investors tendering for contract development initiative, or convincing your organization [00:09:00] to adopt sustainability programs. These all required skills in data literacy to use for evidence-based arguments Speaker 1: And then advancing from, uh, on your first year core subjects where you gained skills in data literacy and knowledge on the complexity of sustainability in your second year of study, you'll then take the course subject to monitoring evaluation and learning. So how do we know if this, uh, sustainability initiative has worked, whether it worked or not, how do organizations [00:09:30] learn from this experience? So in this subject, you'll draw on your understanding from your professional degree and from across humanistic and by a physical disciplines to think about what kinds of indicators, uh, and what kind of data best enable evaluation of progress towards meeting sustainability objectives, and then how to best feed this back into the policy and project cycle to ensure effective organizational learning. And then in your third and fourth year of study, [00:10:00] you move on to what are called capstone subjects. So these are subjects at the final years of your study, designed to draw together the theoretical strands of your degrees and prepare you for life beyond university and deeply embedded into these capstone level subjects is the development of skills like teamwork and project planning and management. Speaker 2: Aside from the core subjects, you'll then select two subjects each from three [00:10:30] of the following strains, plus two electives, which you can draw from any of the four strengths. These strains governance, science industry, and society and culture are designed to give students a breadth of knowledge and skills needed to deal with the different dimensions that pertain to sustainability issues. The science stream gives students foundational knowledge in the biophysical dimensions of sustainability. It introduces the ecological basis upon which we post questions [00:11:00] about sustainability. The governance stream engages with questions and challenges around global and local institutions and the national and transnational laws and policies that shape sustainability issues. The subjects in the industry stream challenged students to engage with real-world problems, to develop mindsets for innovation, and to bring you into a direct contact with professionals and practitioners in the sustainability field. Lastly, the society [00:11:30] and culture stream immerses students in the human side of sustainability people and communities and their cultural behaviors, social systems, and the histories and how these are bound up with the sustainability challenges we face. Speaker 2: These streams are meant to compliment your professional degree. And so your professional degree, which is the other degree you're doing will dictate which streams you need to choose from. For example, if you're doing a bachelor of science as your other degree, [00:12:00] you won't really be required to take the science stream, but instead complete subjects from the governance industry and society and culture streams. This is because you don't want too much overlap with the existing subjects. You've taken your science degree, or if you're taking the bachelor of business or economics or management, you won't be required to take the industry stream, but instead complete subjects from governance, science, and society and culture. Again, this is to avoid a one-sided degree on sustainability, [00:12:30] where the industry stream will come, will encompass a lot of what you've covered already in your business studies. Speaker 1: So how are you going to fit all of it in? So here's a sample study plan for combining the degree with a bachelor of business. So in your first year you would take four subjects in the business degree, and then two of the core introductory subjects in the bachelor of sustainability and environment, and then as well, commenced two subjects [00:13:00] in your designated sustainability and environment streams. You know, second year you take one core subject in the bachelor of sustainability and environment, and then two subjects in your designated sustainability stream. And then again, complete the core subjects of your business degree in years, three and four, you complete your major in the business degree, complete one capstone subject each year for the bachelor of sustainability environment. And you can complete your final subjects in your designated sustainability streams [00:13:30] across these years. You'll also have a couple of elective choices, Speaker 2: Just unmuting myself there, workplaces, including private companies, government and non-government organizations are hoping for graduates who are ready to make an impact right away and rapidly grow into sustainability leaders. Some organizations invest considerable resources in professional upskilling [00:14:00] and have training officers to execute their sustainability related work. But many organizations still have no option, but to outsource the more complicated work. So industry needs people equipped with a solid grounding in scientific cultural and economic knowledge combined with soft skills like data analysis, teamwork, and communication. It's also about the ability to actively challenge existing paradigms and to be comfortable with uncertainty. There is a sense of urgency around [00:14:30] the need for sustainability action in response to changes in regulation, public pressure and business risks, as well as to new opportunities. Entry-level positions include sustainability project officer in companies, government, and non organized non-government organizations, support development, delivery, and evaluation of initiatives and programs. Speaker 2: Other opportunities include sustainability consultant. Someone who carries that carries out research to provide advice on various sustainability [00:15:00] related improvements, or you could work as a business analyst training officer for compliance officer at a more senior level with experience and or postgraduate qualifications. One can work as a corporate social responsibility or sustainability director is in charge of designing and implementing strategies with respect to corporate responsibility, environmental, social governments, issues, responsible investment, and corporate citizenship. [00:15:30] There are other opportunities for more senior people in both large and small organizations, such as sustainability coordinator, senior sustainability advisor, or sustainability program manager. Speaker 1: So we want to finish off the presentation by emphasizing UTS has reputation, a reputation in producing industry ready graduates. So does the study at UTS means you will be gaining an edge over others when [00:16:00] you go out and compete for jobs as a graduate throughout your combined degree, you will gain industry exposure from the first year of study through to your final year of study. So industry engagement is deeply embedded into your coursework where you will apply theory to real world issues and scenarios that businesses, governments and communities are grappling with. And you will engage with these actors in your projects. So in the bachelor of sustainability and environment, we will bring industry experts, rep [00:16:30] representatives from the public sector, endures not-for-profits startups and local community practitioners into the classroom by a guest lectures and panels, project mentoring, and promote internship opportunities. And right here at UTS, we have an immense amount of expertise to also draw from researchers who are doing work at the forefront of sustainable development researchers from the Institute of sustainable futures, climate justice research center, the center for [00:17:00] social justice and inclusion and our core teaching team as well. Also value research inspired teaching, and we are directly engaged in applied research locally and globally in fields of Marine and fisheries, urban governance, city planning, community development, and social and cultural sustainability among others. And finally, a UTS feels to have a unit that's dedicated to fostering entrepreneurial-ism called UTS startups. And this is an exciting space for [00:17:30] sustainability leaders. Thank you. Speaker 1: I think we'll open it to questions. [00:18:00] Yeah. So we've got a question from Molly. Do I do go in any field studies in this course? Yes. So you do field work, um, from the very first, uh, year, um, uh, you go on, um, [00:18:30] uh, you go to a field excursion, so you gradually build your skills in how to do field work, um, whether that be quantitative or qualitative, uh, but as well as skills in community engagement. Kate, did you want to add anything to that? Speaker 2: Um, no, I think I might have, um, removed the question from your feed. So am I clicking the wrong button? Um, just, yeah, we start with the field studies from the first subject, which I'm teaching at the moment, [00:19:00] sustainability in context. And unfortunately because of the lockdown, we're not doing the field trip this this time, but we will of course do it in future semesters. And it went really well in the, in the first session this year. And, um, then there were some, there will be field studies also imagining, um, the, the professional degrees that students are doing. Speaker 1: Oh, yes, that's right. And your professional degrees, you will also, okay. [00:19:30] Can you go into city planning sector from this degree, Speaker 2: Kate? Yeah, I, I mentioned you could, um, there was city planning degrees. I imagine, particularly if you do one of the business related degrees, you may then be able to work as a graduate in a city planning area and then do a post-graduate degree in city planning. But, um, sustainability definitely fits really well with the, with city [00:20:00] planning as a career. Speaker 1: So city planning is, can be very broad depending on what, what, um, you could be an actual, you know, surveyor or, uh, uh, so it's, uh, it can be broad or a community development, uh, or in community development. So that's all in a range of city planning. So depending on what it is, uh, what aspect, but definitely an expertise in sustainability would be key or put, give you that edge to city planning. Speaker 2: [00:20:30] We have another question there about the benefit of doing this combined degree, as opposed to just as a standalone degree. So there's the, there is no standalone degree offered at UTS in sustainability environment. We only offer it as a combined degree, but if you were to do it the other degree, so if you just to do a business degree, say, or a health degree, uh, the benefit is adding the sustainability aspect [00:21:00] too to that base degree. So that, that that's the benefit. You get more study you're ha you're more, you've got more multi-disciplinary skills and you've got the ability to work in the sustainability area. Speaker 1: So what kind of jobs could come out of the management sustainability combination? Kate, did you want to address that one? Speaker 2: Well, that, um, second last slide we have, if you [00:21:30] go back to that slide. Yeah. The management plus sustainability degree would pretty much work for most of those, um, options there. So, uh, you then to graduate programs and be working as a sustainability project officer, especially if it's, um, any kind of organization really management is relevant for all kinds of organizations. And [00:22:00] I mean, maybe, maybe not something like heritage planner, possibly, because that would require a different set of skills, but almost all of the other ones would mix well with management. Speaker 1: So when was this degree introduced? So this, uh, um, started last year. So we had our first intake, um, for the degree last year. Um, the students love it. They really do. And, um, uh, yeah, it's been exciting to build, uh, [00:22:30] the degree, um, and as well gain input from their experience and what they'd like to see. Uh, so yeah, it's been exciting to introduce this new degree. Speaker 2: And the next question there is about whether the course fits well with social work. I think possibly a bit like city planning. Uh, you might need another graduate degree afterwards, but possibly the fit with social work and sustainability [00:23:00] might be less connected than city planning. I'm not sure maybe Christine, Speaker 1: I think, I mean, um, yeah, I kind of work in the social field and so, uh, I do think it connects because increasingly that is kind of, um, you know, what, what industry is telling us is not, is that the issues, not so much the science behind sustainability, but it's, um, more the human side, [00:23:30] the people side, understanding people, knowing how to work with people and grappling with the complexity of, um, differences across communities and their needs and their priorities and so on. And so social work, uh, it's a broad field depending on what you, what you want to get into. But I think understanding, cause sustainability initiative, firstly, environmental, um, uh, problems impact the Merced on, uh, there's a, what disadvantage, [00:24:00] there's a marginalized and so on. And so, um, sustainability initiatives then need to take into account, um, these communities more than ever before. So, uh, I think, um, yeah, understanding sustainability particularly around kind of sustainability is, um, social justice and inclusion, uh, connects very strongly with social work, but yes, you need to take, [00:24:30] uh, you know, social work is a specific kind of qualification. Uh, and so, but social work also quite broad in that it could be other things like, you know, community research or community developments or, um, but they definitely connected because sustainability is an issue about the social. Speaker 1: So are there environmental club and is, are there environmental clubs and societies that UTS? Yes, there's a few. And, um, we [00:25:00] have been connecting with them, uh, as, uh, the degree with the, um, the clubs. And so there is actually an active, um, UTS is very active in terms of sustainability. It's very committed to sustainability. Um, they have, uh, a specific, um, uh, unit that, uh, that, uh, drives, um, you know, initiatives that students can get involved in our students. Um, even just from starting, uh, um, uh, [00:25:30] just starting students who have already been involved in a range of, uh, sustainability initiatives, um, related to social clubs, uh, in student clubs and as well, um, UTS as sustainability, Speaker 2: We have time for just one more quick question about the difference between this degree and doing a science degree with an environmental science major. The main difference there is the multidisciplinarity, um, science degree with an environmental science [00:26:00] major. You may have a range of disciplines within science there, but you're not going to have the business, um, and the social and cultural and historical and political, um, content that you get in this, the combined degree that we're offering at UTS, the whole focus of what we would, what we want this degree to be at UTS is multidisciplinary, so that you can tackle those complex challenges that are visible in that matrix of the, um, the UN [00:26:30] sustainable development goals, where there's all sorts of things mixed up that are to do with people, not just the science, so science plus other things. So that's all the questions and we've come to the end of the session open for this degree. So I'd like to thank everyone for attending and wondering if Christine had anything else to say, Speaker 1: [00:27:00] Oh, no, thank you for attending. And we hope, uh, UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands. We would also like to pay respect to the Elders both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for these lands.

Speaker1: Good evening, everyone, and welcome from wherever you happen to be joining us from this evening. So before we begin, I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation upon whose ancestral lands our city campus now stands. I pay respects to the elders, both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land. Before we get into the meat of this evening, we've just got some housekeeping that will run through first. Now I'll introduce myself. I am Dr. Xanthe Spindler. I'm a senior lecturer of forensic science here at UTS, and I'm the program director for our Master of Forensic Science and our Associated Postgraduate Forensic Science Programs. So in this session, I'll run through a bit of an introduction about post-graduate forensic science here at UTS. Why you want to come study with us, and you do. But we'll go through a few reasons as to why. A bit about our program. So what you can do in postgraduate forensic science, the nitty gritty details about some general information and also how to apply as well. So why study postgraduate coursework here at UTS? Well, the first thing is you'll gain real world skills. All of our laboratories are set up to mimic working real life forensic science laboratories. We also have great partnerships with our industry partners and your future employers. So this makes sure that what you learn is both up to date and industry relevant to help you get that step ahead as you leave for the workplace. Speaker1: We pride ourselves on our flexible approach to education as well. All of our postgraduate courses are using what we refer to as blended learning. There's a combination of online and face to face courses and also a mix of these two modes within subjects themselves to make sure you get the most out of your learning and can approach it in the best, most flexible way possible for you. We also have some great related research facilities. So not only do you get to learn in our specialized labs, including our two crime scene suites, but you'll also get experience in a range of research and teaching, specially designed places full of high class and world leading instrumentation as well. You'll also learn from academics who are leaders in their field. So all of us here in the centre of forensic science are right on the cutting edge of the research we do. And at UTS in general, we're ranked above world standard in all of our scientific disciplines. And as I mentioned before, we do have this really strong industry connection. Many of our graduates over the last 20 years have gone into high ranking positions within industry. And we still keep these contacts alive. We do also have the opportunity to work on research projects or research internships with our industry partners, such as government and police laboratories as well. So what does post-graduate forensic science look like here within the centre of forensic science? We look at a range of disciplines which can take you in various career pathways so you can look at opportunities in government or private forensic laboratories. Speaker1: So some of those more traditional pathways in forensic science. Looking at the more law enforcement side and that nexus with other disciplines like policing and criminology, drug detection and analytical chemistry is quite strong here as well. So you can learn those skills and move more down the analytical chemistry pathways and our interpretation side as well. So really understanding then how the forensic results and all of that lab component then gets into the into the courts and how it's understood by juries and presented as well. So our admission requirements into this program is a bachelor's degree or higher in any related discipline of forensic science or in forensic science itself. So chemical sciences, biochemistry, molecular biology, medical science, those sorts of backgrounds. We have a range of nested programs within our postgraduate space, starting with a one semester or 24 credit point graduate certificate all the way down to our two two year programs, our Master of Forensic Science Extension and our Master of Philosophy programs. You can gain direct entry into most of these programs except for the Master of Philosophy and the Graduate Diploma. If you wish to do the graduate diploma, you can either transfer once you're enrolled into one of these programs. And with the Master of Philosophy, we'll talk a little bit more about the pathway into that program towards the end of the presentation. Speaker1: So our graduate certificate is one session, so one semester full time or one year part time. And you have a combination of professional and forensic science subjects as part of this program. You learn the the core skills within forensic science, so foundations of forensic science and forensic inference and interpretation, which form the bedrock of everything we do within the discipline. And then you also get a choice of some elective subjects, and you can choose these from our professional or our professional's core range of subjects as well. A graduate diploma in forensic science is one year full time or two years part time. And again, you can see how these nest together in terms of how the structure is set up. So we've still got our core forensic science or our bedrock forensic science subjects, and then you can add in some extra discipline electives. So other forensic science subjects such as those listed on the side and some professional subjects as well. Then we move into our Master of Forensic Science. And this course is one and a half years, full time or three years part time. And this is where you start to get some more flexibility in your study plan. You'll take on two semesters of forensic science subjects, and you have a choice of various disciplines here with your crime scene investigation and management, forensic toxicology, chemical criminalistics, biometrics, as well as your as well as your core subjects as well. Speaker1: And you do also have the option in this program to look at research internships. Our final fully coursework subject is our master of forensic science extension. This is the has the base of the Master of Forensic Science and adds on an additional semester of elective subjects. These can be cross faculty electives so you can pick from other programs or other disciplines. Or you might choose to take on a semester long research internship as that extra 24 credit points of electives. If you're thinking about a PhD or you get to the end of your first year and decide that you're actually really interested in the research pathway, then maybe the master of philosophy is for you. Entry into this program is via the Master of Forensic Science or the Master of Forensic Science Extension. You complete your first year and if you meet the the entry requirements, which is a minimum of a credit average in your GPA, and you have a supervisor who's willing to take you on the journey, you can then apply to transfer into the program. It is an intensive second year of research in your program. So you walk out with one year of coursework and one year of research. So how do you apply? For local students, for those of you wanting to enroll for spring session or apply for spring session, applications are open now and they close on the 26th of June. Speaker1: Our spring session starts at the beginning of August. If you wish to start in February 2023, applications will open later this year in September. If you are an international student, please get in touch with the International Office for further information about how to apply or head to the international website shown up here. The question with fees, how much does it cost? We do have a fee calculator on the UTS website at fees.uts.edu.au and you can see how much per subject your program will cost. If you're a UTS alumnus, you will receive a 10% discount on your tuition fees as well. We do have limited scholarships available for postgraduate study coursework level. If you would like more information on this, please visit the UTS Scholarships website. We do have some recognition of prior learning pathways. So if you've previously studied related subjects or in the forensic science discipline, you may be eligible for course credit on some of your subjects. And you can check out more at the recognition of prior learning website. Or if you're not sure and you want to ask some questions, feel free to get in touch and we'll we'll answer your questions as best we can. For English language requirements for those joining us from overseas is standard across all of our postgraduate programs. So this is an IELTS score of 6.5 overall with a minimum of a 6 in writing. Speaker1: If you're interested in what we refer to as a higher degree of research. So a Master of Science Research, two years intensive research project or a PhD, which is a three year research intensive project, we do also have a number of PhD positions available within CFS. We're always keen to talk to prospective students about potential projects. If you have any questions about this, you can head to our Future Students website or you can get in touch with the Science Research Office at science.research@UTS.edu.au and they'll help you get in contact with one of our CFS academics. If you want to have a face to face chat with us, which is a bit of a novelty these days, we will have an on campus science postgraduate info evening happening on the 15th of June. You'll be able to chat to our current academics, myself included, I'll be there. Some of our current students and our admissions experts. And you can register at the URL shown below. We're also hosting a number of one on one chats where, if you would prefer a 15 minute intensive Q&A session with one of our academics, you can come and chat to me or my colleagues about the generalities of UTS life, study or grill us about your most detailed questions about the program to to work out whether it is really for you. And these are happening between the 16th and the 24th of June. So we have a question here. Is it better to complete a Bachelor of Forensic Science and then move on to the Masters and then a PhD? Or do the Bachelor with Honours and then do a PhD. This is an interesting question and it depends on your pathway. So if you're currently already looking at so if you're a year 12 student or currently one of our Bachelor of Forensic Science students, we recommend that you would go into the honors program and then on to a PhD. If you're coming from another discipline, for example, say you're studying a chemistry degree at the moment and you think that, okay, post-graduate forensic science is is where you want to end up, then the Master's program and then transferring into the MPhil program would be the better pathway. So it just depends on your particular learning situation and what you're currently studying as well. If you do want to talk specifics about this again, please feel free to get in touch during one of those one on one sessions. So another question here. What the classes look like? It depends on our subjects. But some of these subjects, will be wholly online. So some of our smaller subjects, you can do it any time, they're self directed. You do have assessments and and support from the academics, but there's no formal classes For our forensic science classes, we have, we value our face to face. All of your on campus time is going to be in some kind of active class, usually laboratory settings where you actually get to practice forensic science methods and investigate mock cases and workshops as well, where you start to apply some of the theory and discuss some of the more up and coming issues around the concepts that you're learning. Okay. Question here, how many contact hours are required per week and can you work full time while studying full time? Usually for most of our classes we have anywhere between, and this running off the top of my head, anywhere between sort of 3 to 6 contact hours per week per subject. This is for an eight credit point subject so that the bigger subjects, our smaller credit point subjects will have usually have fewer contact hours. We do have some students who work and study full time, which is technically feasible given all of our classes are in the evenings, but it is quite a big load to take on. So we do recommend, if you're working full time, that may be taking a slightly lower course load or a partial course load might be a little bit less stressful on on your situation. Will international students get the same exposure to industry as the local. Yes we have plenty of projects that or if you go down the, sorry, thinking of the word, the research internship route. And even with our infill projects, we have had plenty of international students working with our industry partners. Some occasionally, there may be some sensitivities around certain data, but we can integrate our and we do integrate our international students with our industry partners at the same rate that we do for our local students. Another question here. If I'm not looking to do research, which level of study would you recommend? Particularly, which level will give the best opportunities for employment after finishing or give the most diverse experience across career options. If the research pathway isn't the really way you see your career going, I would recommend the the 72 or the 96 credit point, either Master of Forensic Science or Master of Forensic Science Extension. This will give you a good, broad forensic science education, and it will give you exposure to all of those professional aspects, both in the laboratory and some of our more general professional subjects as well. So what prior knowledge or study is expected of me to do well in this course? We do have a couple of streams of knowledge. You'll notice that some of our questions are more biology focused, while others are more chemistry focused. Generally speaking, we assume that you do have some prior science knowledge, so a minimum of first year chemistry and biology. And for some of the more advanced subjects, usually assuming that you have done at least second year in chemistry or biology as well, so a general science degree is the assumed knowledge. Do you assist students in sourcing internships and is this a requirement of the course? We can do so, usually with these internship projects, they tend to be more research based. We can and I can help get people in touch with prospective supervisors or where we have industry projects available. So yes, we do help you get in touch if you if you wish to. But we also encourage students, if you come with an existing contact or you've you've made a contact through, for example, a professional society, then we also welcome those coming in as well. It's not a requirement of the course. These subjects are electives, so you can choose to do wholly coursework rather than going out and and having this research internship experience. Do I get any credit or advantages having done my undergraduate degree at UTS? You will be eligible for some RPL. So, for example, for Foundations of Forensic Science, but we, our Masters subjects are at a different level to our undergraduate, so you won't be able to get course credit for the bulk of your degree. So, yes, some RPL. So I think we've got time for two last quick ones. So what sort of career options are there upon finishing the course? There are quite a few options available. So most of our graduates go into the sort of more traditional forensic science career path. So either with government or police, laboratory, forensic laboratories or into private practice, and there are some private facility or forensic science practices around Australia. Some of our graduates decide that research is where they want to be, and so they move into a PhD and into academia. Others go into related career paths. So still connected to forensic science, we've had graduates go everywhere from our fire investigation companies through to chemical sales and into government policy as well. And final question, are there any forensic science specific bridging courses or study help? We don't have any specific bridging courses at postgraduate level coming in. We do give you the foundation knowledge in Foundations of Forensic Science. But there is some informal study help in terms of if you are overwhelmed or you are, you're needing a little bit of extra help with some of the the concepts in your first couple of semesters. Please reach out to your teaching staff or to me. And we can we can help with with those aspects and help find you some support. So thank you, everyone, for joining this evening. If you have any further questions or you'd like to book a one on one consultation with myself or a member of the postgraduate team, you can do so now. Otherwise, we've got our on campus event coming up on the 15th of June. If you'd like to chat in person or get in touch. So thanks very much and hopefully we see you on campus soon. Megan: All right. Good evening, everyone, and welcome. It's great to see so many of you have decided to join us this evening. Before we begin, I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eoranation upon whose ancestral lands our city campus now stands. I pay respect to the elders, both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land. All right. So joining us today, my name is Dr. Megan Murray, and I'm the Associate Head of School for Life Sciences. And my job is to look after the postgraduate programs in my school, as well as connecting with the other program directors for various master's courses. Joining me tonight is Dr. Andrew Care, who was a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the School of Life Sciences and the current Pprogram Director for Biomedical Engineering. As well, we have Dr. Joanna Wang, who is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Physical Sciences, and she is the Program Director for the Master of Science Major in Mathematical and Statistical Modelling. We also have Associate Professor Cathy Gorrie who is a Senior Lecturer at UTS and also the Course Director of the Master of Science Medical Laboratory Science Program. So tonight I'm going to give you an introduction to postgraduate studies. I'm also going to walk you through why study here at UTS and what are things that we offer you compared to other places in Sydney and Australia? We will give you an overview to each of our programs and some of the values and career directions that these programs position you for, as well as some essential information and how to apply, should you be interested in studying with us. Megan: So why postgraduate coursework at UTS? Postgraduate studies represent a way to accelerate your professional training in science, positioning you for the careers and roles that you're aspiring to as a professional. You'll gain valuable expertise in real world skills relevant to the field of science of your choice, plus important professional skills that all jobs require, including communication and data analytics. We also have a very nice range of professional electives in important areas like science, innovation and research, development and commercialisation, which are worth considering as well. Postgraduate studies here are designed to be flexible, so this is a mix of face to face and online content which enable you to study whilst you work or have other work life commitments beyond UTS. We also have evening classes for all of our compulsory subjects and we also have block mode as well so that you get all of your learning done in short amounts of time, which are complemented by online learning in Canvas. We're proud to have world class facilities on our UTS campus. This includes state of the art educational laboratories, crime scene simulation labs, as well as the scientific tools and technologies you'll be using again in your careers. UTS teaching is heavily connected to our Australian research, so you can expect to learn from the best while you're here. We have academics who are leaders in their field of teaching that are connected with our students and giving us the practical elements to all of our classes. And it's important to know that we're also ranked above world standards for all of our scientific disciplines, including mathematics, chemistry, medicine and environmental science. We are a university who values our industry partners. In many of our programs, you will learn directly from industry experts and have an opportunity to connect and learn from these experts while you're at UTS. This includes Sydney Water, the Australian Federal Police, the New South Wales Environmental Protection Agency and New South Wales Health Pathology. Megan: Our Master of Science program is shown here with all kinds of pathways to different careers, and the program directors will talk about each of these shortly. For all our Masters programs, there is 48 credit points of subjects that are related to the program you choose, and then a further 24 credits, which are dedicated to highly desired professional skills relevant to all careers in science and beyond. The whole package is designed to be one and a half years worth of full time study with opportunity for part time studies as well. A Master of Science program has a major called Advanced Studies. The Advanced Studies Program is designed to deliver the advanced professional skills for all scientists, where you can build and tailor a study package to fit your needs and professional interests. This opens the door for a wide range of professional careers, including data analytics and digital skills, research and development, as well as careers in technology and beyond. I'm going to have Dr. Andrew Care now talking about Biomedical Engineering. Andrew: Thanks, Megan. Hello, everyone. I'm Andrew Care. I'm the Program Director for Biomedical Engineering here at UTS. In the biomedical engineering major we want to foster the next generation of biomedical researchers, innovators, policymakers and industry leaders. Here you learn the latest medical technologies, how they work, how they're made, and how they're translated from the lab into the world where they can solve real challenges. You'll be given the opportunity to do research in the lab, and there are potential chances to interact with the local science industry. Upon completing the biomedical engineering degree, we hope that you'll be able to enter the biomedical workforce armed with the skills you need to work in a world class science lab, innovate new medical devices, or even start your own science company. Thanks. Megan: Hello again. So I'm back again to talk about the Environmental Consultancy and Conservation Program, which I am the Program Director for. So this is a brand new Masters major that we've just introduced this year, and it's aimed at people that are looking for careers in consultancy firms, government agencies, including local councils up to the larger units, New South Wales EPA, land and water, national parks and so on. So this is designed with the environmental career specialist in mind and it's basically a mix of field based training with all of the theories that we'd expect to learn as a field based ecologist. So when we're talking about field skills, we're talking about all of the essentials in wildlife techniques and animal handling for a variety of fauna, including echidnas, kangaroos and other species, plants and vegetation identification, which are really important, particularly working on job sites across Australia, water quality monitoring, contaminated land assessment and management and so on. And all of these are taught by leading Australian experts. So the admission requirements for this program are a Bachelor's degree. But interestingly we also have prior learning with some of our short courses which feed into the program. So if you've completed any of the micro credentials, for example, Wildlife Field Techniques or any of the CSARM modules, you are eligible for course credits for this particular program. And now we'll have Joanna talking about the Mathematical and Statistical Modelling major. Joanna: Hi, I'm Joanna. I'm the Program Director for the Mathematical and Statistical Modelling Major. So the major Mathematical and Statistical Modelling represents a well rounded suite of learning, with students taking a balanced mix of theoretical subjects and a variety of applied and computational mathematics and statistical subjects. Now we offer subjects including optimisation, advanced spatial methods, probability theory, financial econometrics and machine learning. And this major will also have a professional capstone project where students bring together the analytical skills, problem solving skills, communication and project management skills which they have developed throughout the Masters program into this capstone project. Graduates with a Master of Science degree majoring in Mathematical and Statistical Modelling have many varied careers. Graduates pursue careers in a diverse range of industries such as business, banking and finance., education, government, technology, engineering and consultancy. Admission requirements include a Bachelor's degree or higher in mathematical or statistical sciences. Cathy: Hi there. I'm going to talk about Medical Laboratory Science major. This major is made up of three very specific diagnostic subjects which cover topics like bacteriology and virology, hematology, transfusion science, histology and anatomical pathology, as well as proteomics and lab management. And then there is a range of elective subjects and professional subjects that students have the opportunity to select. This major follows on from the Graduate Certificate and Graduate Diploma of Medical Laboratory Science, but expands those professional streams and the attributes that are expected at a high tertiary level . So it's aimed at people with a biomedical science background or people who are already working in diagnostic laboratories or have completed a tertiary qualification in that sort of field. Okay. Megan: Hello again. So the Master of Science program enables you to go further in your study should you choose to follow a research pathway. So this is a pathway to PhD studies at UTS. So if you have a successful completion of any Master or Philosophy degree, you can transition on to a PhD or a Doctorate of Philosophy if that's your goal. So basically what that would represent as the Master of Philosophy in Science is you would have 48 credit points of learning in your first year and in your second year, you would have a research project which is focused on a topic of interest where you would be supervised by UTS academic. So admission for this program is via internal course transfers after completion of 48 credit points of a Masters or a Masters extension degree. And so talk to your program directors if you're interested in basically adding more research to your degree and potentially transitioning on to a PhD through the Masters pathway. So how to apply? Let's say that you are interested in what we're talking to you about tonight. Local students submit your applications online through uts.edu.au/pg-admissions portal. So if you're wishing to start the spring sessions, the applications for this are now open and they will close on the 26th of June 2022 if you're wanting to start next ... the due date is September of 2022. International students, if you're tuning in, thank you very much for joining us. And we have a UTS international office which will give you the best advice for how to apply in Australia. For more essential information, if you're interested in the fees of our courses, you can use our fee calculator for any of our subjects to determine how much it will cost you. Megan: All UTS students who have done an undergraduate degree or similar with us are automatically eligible for an alumni discount. So check out our alumni page. We also offer scholarships for different programs in different students, too. And it's always worth checking to see if you are eligible for extra support at UTS. We also have recognition of prior learning if you've studied anything that's relevant to the programs that you're interested in. So if you have previously studied, you might be eligible for course credits. And for more information on that, check out our Prior Learning Information page. We do have English language requirements. This includes an IELTS score of 6.5 overall and writing of 6.0. And this is particularly important for international students where English isn't your first language. And for more information on that, please check out our English Language Requirements page. Megan: So if you're interested in a higher degree of research, we offer the Doctor of Philosophy as well as a Master of Science (Research). For more information on something that's just about research, check out our research courses pathway through our website. If you're interested in getting just a little taster of what we offer here at UTS, we have several micro credentials which actually give you credits, as we were mentioning earlier, for some of the Masters programs. The micro credentials that we offer at the moment include Clinical Trials: Evidence and Design, Genomics and Precision Medicine, Understanding Data: Statistical Models for Binary Outcomes, and many more. So check out open.uts.edu.au to see about any microcredentials that might interest and inspire you for further studies at UTS, if you're not entirely sure about Masters just for you just yet. Megan: So we have some information sessions coming up after this one. If you'd like to meet us and chat with us face to face, please come along and join us for the Science Postgraduate Information Evening. This will have academics as well as current students and will also talk about the admissions process for coming in to UTS. So this will be on Wednesday, the 15th of June, and it will kick off at 5 p.m. and finishing at 7 p.m.. So please come and join us if you're able to. We would love to meet you and talk some more about postgraduate studies. We're also available for one on one chats if you're unable to attend campus, so you can discuss your options with an academic expert or talk to a current postgrad student about UTS life in general. So these are little 15 minute chats with us, and we're always happy to talk and answer any questions that you may have at any time. So these one on one sessions will be running from the 16th to 24th of June, and if you're interested in the short chat, you can register at science.uts.edu.au/future. All right. So I think we're ready for Question Time now. If I can get some help with some of the questions that we might like to answer. Cathy: Well, shall I start off at the top of the list with a question from Nicky about who's currently completing her graduate diploma in medical laboratory science? And she wants to know if I'd recommend completing a Masters of Science. Nicky, it really depends on what stage of your career you're at. So the Masters program will really enhance your professional skills and give you a lot of additional professional attributes that are expected at a higher level of a career. Megan: All right. So we've got a question from Shane in the chat who's asked how would someone with a degree in an unrelated field make the transition? Is another full degree required? So as a Program Director, I would say it depends on the degree and your experience as well as the other experience that you've had in the workforce before you're coming on board as a Masters student. So all of that is taken into account when you apply at UTS, and that's true for domestic as well as international students. So if you're interested in the experience that you've got, as university studies as well as your more broader professional experience, please feel free to have a chat with us and we can offer you some specific advice about, would this be a good fit for you, or is there something smaller that you might want to take on first before committing to a bigger Masters? Okay. So we've got some anonymous questions now. I've previously studied a postgraduate degree. Can I get credit off the UTS degree? The answer is yes, as long as the degree is similar and relevant to what we're offering at UTS. So for example, if you've started postgraduate studies in a science course that's similar to what we're offering here, we can compare the units that you have completed with the units that we offer at UTS and then you can get recognise prior learning for those particular units. There's a lab placement question that perhaps you might be interested in Cathy. Cathy: Yeah, sure. So again, as part of our Masters program in Medical Laboratory Science, we don't offer lab based placement, so there's no opportunity to get those workplace skills. So again, it's going to very much depend on your level of experience and your the stage of career that you're at. So if you're looking at an entry level career, then you might might be better served looking for jobs and thinking about doing postgraduate study in the future. Or you might want to do one of those short courses which will enhance your skills, but allow you time to also try and get a foot in the door of the workforce. Megan: That sounds good. We've got a question in a chat about biomedical engineering that Andrew might like to answer. Andrew: Is there room in the biomedical engineering major to do a short research project as an elective. Yes, absolutely. So we offer a short one and a longer one, depending on how many credit points you want to use. You can do them in a research lab. And we're also hoping to be able to, hopefully in the future, offer them with industry partnerships for a project as well. And you just have to write a report at the end. Megan: Sounds good. We've also got a question in the chat about the Maths major for you, Joanna. Joanna: I would say the Math major, because we teach students a lot of the data and analysis skills. And I would say any kind of job that requires you to deal with data, graduates with a Maths major will be in high demand. So banks in the finance sector, in the government, in companies, industries, I would say anywhere that requires people who look at data and make sense of it. Yes. Megan: I've got a question in the chat. Are there micro credentials on offer in other branches of science, other than medical science? The answer is absolutely. So we do have a range of micro credentials for all of our science programs. We have one that I mentioned earlier, which is wildlife field techniques that teaches animal handling skills by Australian experts at an actual zoo down in Nowra. We actually have two more micro credentials coming in. The first is looking at vegetation skills and plant identification. And the second one is looking at water quality assessment relevant to Australian guidelines. But there's a whole heap of really good microcredentials on offer. So I really do encourage you to check out UTS open and see what's available that might interest you. I've got a question, what are the semester dates for spring 2022? I think off the top of my head, I'm pretty sure we kick off at the start of August. I'll just double check that for you now. Can anyone else confirm that's the start of August, end of July, that spring session? Cathy: Yes, I can confirm it's the 1st of August. Megan: Fantastic. As someone that's actually teaching a subject myself in spring, that's something that I should have tattooed to the back of my hand. So thanks for asking that and I hope that's helpful. Okay. So we've had an upvote. Thanks for your help. Ah, you're welcome. Are you able to point me where I can get in touch with someone who can help decide the pathway that would be most suitable for me? Excellent question. So we're happy to meet you as program directors and those one on one chats that we were talking about, you can have more than one chat with one of us. So if you're thinking about your options and there's more than one Masters program that interests you, feel free to chat with more than one of us. Otherwise we'll probably all be there for the on campus information evening. And that's a really nice way to actually meet us and meet the students and get a good sense for the future at UTS and what it might hold for you as well as what might be a good fit for you in terms of your learning. So yeah, come and talk to us. We're very happy to chat. Any questions, big or small. Cathy: And I think I can talk to that first question. Somebody who's doing a double degree in science and international studies, when you're applying for a postgraduate study at UTS, we don't look at your academic GPA only. We're looking at your experiences and your background and what your capacity is to undertake a program of study here. So when you put your applications in, make sure you include all the relevant documentation, the transcripts of any degrees that you hold, because we'll actually look at the subjects that you've completed rather than what your overall GPA is. Megan: I've had a question from a student who says, next year I will finish my double bachelor degree. Well done. Majoring in Environmental Biotechnology. Do you think it is suitable for me to enrol in this program? Thanks. You're welcome. Thanks for asking. I think that the program you might be talking about would be either the Environmental Consultancy and Conservation program or potentially you could be talking about Advanced Studies as well. Again, both of those programs would be suitable, particularly if you've been doing a double degree. And like Cathy was saying, we take into account not just your studies, but also your other expertise and experience more broadly, too. So if you're interested, please do apply, because we're very happy to take into account all of your experience before you start at UTS. I've had a question how many scholarships are generally available each year to Masters students? So the scholarships page actually has details on all of the individual scholarships available for students, and some of them are quite specific and some of them do have more than one scholarship per round. So again, I'd really encourage you to check out the scholarship schemes that are available each year and see if any of them are good fit for you. I'm not actually certain of the number of scholarships, but that page will have a good indication of the different types. Would anyone like to speak to working full time and studying part time? That's a good question. That's a broad question for any Masters student, I think. Cathy: Well, all we can really say is UTS does encourage students who have got a wide range of of other obligations in their lives and there are usually evening classes available if we have on campus classes or online opportunities if we're not delivering things face to face. So we try and be as flexible as possible and that applies for assignment options and assessment tasks. There's usually a windows of opportunity, especially for our Masters students, because we know, we recognise that that people are working full time or have other commitments in their lives. Megan: Yeah, exactly. Super good question. So I've got. A question from Natalie. Hello. I did a Bachelor of Science Advanced Science, but majored in forensic science. That's fantastic. Well done. I know that the UTS Handbook for Master of Science majoring in Biomedical Engineering requires a Bachelor's degree in a related field. How would I go with enrolling in this course as I'm not sure if it's related. So what's your thoughts, Andrew? Andrew: Yes, I think it is related. I think there's a lot of stuff that we can cross over. So you can get enrolled in the course. Megan: Yes, exactly. So what am I talking about, a relevant degree, I mean, if you have studied science, particularly Advanced Science already with us at UTS, that's already positioning you for a lot of knowledge and experience relevant to postgraduate science in general. Question from Dean. Can your previous postgraduate course subjects from other universities be assessed first without formally applying? As a program director, we could do that, but the... Traditionally you put your subjects in your application and we can let you know what's eligible. But please feel free to chat with us as program directors and let us know what you've studied already, and we're happy to give you advice before you apply. It looks like we got one last question around us off for 6pm. How much of the work in the Masters degree is online versus in-person? So I might actually get one of the program directors to speak about it because they're all about the same, I think. Who'd like to pick it up. I'm happy to, if you'd like to. Andrew: Well, I think, yeah, there's definitely a mixture of online versus in-person and some of the electives that you can choose the micro credentials. For example, a lot of those are just purely online. And then there are, of course, some courses that run in-person. But we try to accommodate you as best we can to sometimes have hybrid classes as well. Megan: Yeah, exactly right. And as we mentioned earlier, we also do night classes which can accommodate people that are working full time during the day. And we do block mode learning, which is either all of your classes in a couple of days so that you don't have to take too much time off of work. Or we do field-based learning which is block on the weekends if you're looking at the environmental course. So yeah, we have lots of different ways that you can learn at UTS to try and fit it in with the rest of your life. Cathy: And you can select elective options that might suit your lifestyle better. So some of those options will be online. Or if you really want to come in, you can select elective options which are delivered on campus. So a lot of it is, again, flexible and in your hands. Megan: All right. We've got no more questions and we've made it to 6 p.m. on time. Thank you so much for joining us, everyone. It's been lovely to meet you and answer your questions. Please do book in a 15 minute chat with us if you're interested in more. Otherwise, come and meet us on the next on campus event. We're very happy to talk to you some more about postgraduate studies. Okay. We'll say thank you and good evening. Mary: Welcome, everyone. My name is Mary Coupland I am an Associate Professor at the University of Technology, Sydney. Behind me in my screensaver, you can see the lovely Building 7 where I work and the courtyard there. UTS has some very interesting spaces on campus and that's a photo of me. I would be very happy to chat with you about your own particular case in the future if you need to get in touch. But there are also 1 to 1 sessions. A little bit more about that later on in the slides. So this is what we will cover this particular session. So why go to UTS? I like these three concepts. You're at the centre. We know about teaching. We train teachers for the workplace. We have involvement with schools. So, we feel very much that we are connected into schools and school teaching. And if you are a learner at UTS, then there is plenty of support for you in many ways at the university. Obviously, the real world skills there mentioned will be about your professional needs as a teacher. And the flexible approach idea is key to everything we do. Study online. Learn in your own time. Meet with people on campus when you can. This slide is a generic slide about our research. Of course, we have a lot of pride in our research and in mathematics in particular. We are highly ranked in mathematics and statistics research. Mary: Postgraduate coursework at UTS is very much in demand now. This is where I start to feel a bit more at home because this is about the course that with others I've designed and we run have been running now for two years. It's designed especially for people who are already teachers. So you are a teacher, perhaps of geography, history, primary, and you would like to be a teacher of mathematics. You might even be currently teaching some mathematics classes. But we know that you will be a better teacher of mathematics, if you have an experience of learning mathematics at university level. It gives you that depth of understanding. It gives you a confidence that you can look up things to answer your students' questions. It just enriches your offering to your students completely. And so the idea is that you are interested in becoming an accredited teacher of mathematics. We know that a lot of people currently do teach mathematics, even if they haven't studied a lot of maths themselves. But this gives you the university level mathematics that you need for accreditation. So the admission requirements there include that you are already a recognised, have a recognised bachelor's degree from ... I was going to say an Australian institution, but of course it might be an overseas qualification and we can assess those. And then also you need to be either accredited with NESA at the moment or have equivalent qualifications and experience to get that accreditation. Mary: Now, the degree that we're talking about is a Graduate Diploma in Mathematics for Secondary Education. You can see there it's 48 credit points. Now, usually credit points translate into subjects by simple formula. There are six credit points subjects in science. So that means eight subjects will get you the Graduate Diploma. You can complete it in two years part time. That's how it's designed to be done, part time. And you can see the subjects that are there. Just briefly, Statistics is a fairly conventional introduction to statistics, but along the way we will talk about the statistics that's in high school teaching. Algebra is linear algebra. It's about matrices and applying mathematics to many different kinds of industrial and technological and scientific problem solving situations. But what you might be more familiar with is the idea of Calculus and Calculus 1, 2, and 3 follow on sequentially. You don't have to do Calculus 2 before Calculus 3, but Calculus 1is a prerequisite for 2 and 3. Foundations is where you would probably begin that journey, because Foundations includes the kind of mathematics you would study at HSC level in New South Wales if you're doing maths in extension one. So, along the way we do know who our cohort is, who we design these subjects for, so I'll tell you a little bit more about that later And then there are these two subjects at the end there. The first one is Mathematics Methods for In-Service Teachers. So this is what we call a pedagogy subject. This is where you will look at lesson planning for a maths class. You will look at how to assess the learning of students in mathematics at high school level. And there is a professional experience or a practicum. So those are the eight subjects in the graph. And thanks, Laura. On the next slide, we have the subjects in the Masters, so it includes all of the subjects in the Grad. Dip. and then an extra four subjects of electives. This makes it very flexible. You could choose some more mathematical electives, or you could choose some more pedagogical electives. So quite a lot of choice there. Mary: So this is how you apply. Our next starting point is autumn next year, autumn being the first semester of the year. And we'll open applications in September. Just a reminder, this course is not available for international students. It's a local degree. So that slide has the essential information. If you are an alumnus of of University of Technology, Sydney, you will receive a 10% discount, which is fantastic and there are some scholarships on offer. But I believe the Department of Education also has scholarships, so that's worth looking into. Mary: We are very keen to help you achieve this accreditation in minimum time. So if you have some previous study in mathematics, we can assess that if it's recent within the last five years and apply RPL, recognition of prior learning, which means you don't need to study all of the subjects in the course. There's an English language requirement, of course. Mary: This slide is a standard slide to let you know there are other things you can do at UTS: Research degrees, Master of Science, Master of Teaching in our fellow Faculty. And we also have some short forms of learning. These are shorter courses that lead to practical skills that you can apply immediately. So those are not part of a degree course but are very much targeted to what people need for their jobs. Mary: So we have this opportunity for 1 to 1 chats that I mentioned earlier. It's coming up Wednesday 15th June. And you can register for that by emailing, sorry, by going to that website there. So that's an opportunity to chat. I'll be at that session too. If you want a bit more information, if you contact the Science Faculty and say, 'please pass this on to Mary Coupland', then it'll get to me and I'm happy to do that as well, if you're if you really want some more information more quickly. Otherwise, the June event is highly recommended. Mary: Let's have a look at the questions. Okay. So the first question is, this degree is not available at all for individuals like myself that are undergraduates that will graduate this year. If you are an undergraduate and in a teaching degree, yes, it would be. But if you're an undergraduate in a Science degree or a Mathematics degree and intend to become a teacher of mathematics, then, no, this isn't the right course for you. What you need is a Master of Teaching. So I suppose my answer to that really depends on your particular circumstances. So again, if you'd like to follow that up, please send an email through to the email address that is science@uts.edu.au and ask them to forward it to Mary Coupland. And the next question is, are classes online or face to face? What proportion of each? The classes are online, not face to face. They're online, but also there's a lot of what we call asynchronous learning, which means that you don't have to log in online for a large number of hours each week. It's expected and understood by us that you will be working through some materials online outside of class time. So the class times are quite short, 1 to 2 hours per subject a week and the date in 2023 that Autumn semester begins. I can answer that one. In 2023, Autumn semester begins on Monday, the 20th of February. Monday, 20th of February is the date for the session starting in 2023. Which subjects would be required to study on campus? We have decided to open that up and be more flexible, partly because of COVID and partly because we have someone in the Northern Territory enrolled in this course. And it wasn't practical for that person to come to campus. So, the on campus requirement has been reduced. And at the moment, and I anticipate it will still be the case, we will be offering everything online. If that changes, we will offer you some alternatives if you're not able to get to campus. Okay. So happy to set up a 1 to 1 chat either, as I mentioned earlier, maybe we could go back to that slide about the 14th of June. Yes. 15th of June, sorry. That's an opportunity to chat 1 to 1. But as I mentioned, if you send an email to science@uts.edu.au they will pass it on to me and I would be very happy to meet with you 1 to 1. Sometimes with these kinds of degrees, it does make a difference about your personal circumstances. Mary: There's another question. Is it a science degree or a teaching degree? This is a degree that's owned by the Faculty of Science, but it's designed for teachers. It's designed for people who are already teachers but want to get the mathematics that they need to be qualified to teach mathematics at high school level in New South Wales. So, in that sense it's a hybrid, isn't it? It's a bit of both. So six of the subjects in the Masters and the Graduate are actually mathematics subjects, but they're taught knowing that the people taking the subjects are already teachers and want to become teachers of mathematics. So, in the way that we teach the subjects, we include a lot of what we call micro teaching. So although you're studying university level mathematics, we require that you practise explaining it. And that's excellent preparation to become a teacher of mathematics. So, I hope that answered all of the questions in the Q&A. Is a little of the content completely tailored to New South Wales standard? No, no, the the level of the math, it begins with what we would say, Extension 2 Mathematics, but then it's required by New South Wales Education Standards Authority, that to be accredited as a teacher of mathematics, you do need to have studied university level mathematics. So the subject in this degree do go beyond high school mathematics. Mary: Can the course be extended over more time than two years? Yes. You can take leave. You can slow down your progress. Do one subject per semester instead of two. We can be quite flexible about that. Can I study a semester full time? The answer to that is possibly because the mathematics is sequential and we don't offer every subject every semester. So it's possible, depending on your choice of subjects, but it's quite possible. Do I get credit if I'm a UTS graduate? Anybody who is a graduate who has studied subjects similar to the ones in this degree can apply for recognition of prior learning. So. Yes. Right. So I think we've reached the end of our questions. Okay. So sorry, there's one more. If you are already a history teacher, that's fine. You start with Foundations of mathematics and the starting point for that is really year 10. But it goes quite quickly up to HSC mathematics. Is Extension 2 to equivalent to Specialist? Yes, it is not exactly the same topics, but in broad terms, yes, it is Extension 2 is equivalent to Specialist Maths. Okay. So, Laura, I think we might wrap it up there. Thank you for that slide, because if you have follow up questions, please, please send them to science@uts.edu.au and ask them to send the questions on to me. Speaker1: Good evening, everyone. Welcome. You have decided to attend a webinar about our Master of Medical Biotechnology program. Before we get started, I would like to acknowledge that I am broadcasting this evening from the land of the Gadigal people of the Eora nation whose ancestral lands that the university campus now stands. I'd like to pay respects to the elders, both past and present, and acknowledge them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land. Now, before I get into the information about medical biotechnology, you're here. Who am I? My name is Dr. Matt Padula. I am a senior lecturer in the Faculty of Science. I'm also the program director for Medical Biotech. So if you attend the university to undertake this program, I'm going to be the person who's going to be taking care of you and guiding you through your program and answering all of the different questions that you may have. So in this session, I'm going to give you a brief introduction about the course, why you should study at UTS, what the program entails, information about what it's about, and most importantly, how you guys can apply. Okay, so why do you want to do your postgraduate coursework at UTS? In the Faculty of Science within UTS, we're very, very focused on providing real world skills. Okay, we want you to have practical skills. We want you to be able to be confident in your communication, the way that you conduct yourselves and the background information that you have to be able to fulfil any role within the umbrella of medical biotechnology that you can. Speaker1: It's a flexible approach. We have a mix of face to face and online. And so what that means is that when you come onto campus, it's for a reason. We're not going to get you on to campus just to sit in a lecture and listen to someone drone on. What we're going to do is you come onto campus, you're going to be doing something meaningful, you're going to be doing interactive workshops, or you're going to be doing immersive, practical classes. But before you do that, you will be asked to do a lot of online content, video content, quizzes, other interactive work online to be able to underpin what we then want to teach you in these face to face classes. We do also have evening classes for our compulsory subjects, so if you are working full time, you can often manage the study load by studying in the evening. Now we've got some pretty amazing facilities, especially for med biotech. In the background shot here is of super lab where we actually don't do any practical classes in there. Where we do our practical classes is in a place called the Hive, which is even more impressive than that laboratory that's pictured where you're able to engage in group collaborative work and also be in the same laboratory while other subjects are running. Speaker1: So you can look at what other things are happening in different subjects and say, Hmm, maybe I want to get interested in that. Um, all of our teaching, especially in post-grad, is driven by academics who also are leaders in their research field. We have people who, for instance, I teach proteomics, I run a facility in proteomics, and therefore everything that we do in research, we then put straight directly into our teaching, the same with our microscopy courses, where the person who runs that subject is the director of the microscopy facility here. So you are getting up to date, cutting edge training on up to date, cutting edge equipment from people who are leaders in those fields of research. We do have, and as it's written there, we are well ranked well above world standard and a lot of our scientific disciplines, especially the ones that underpin this research program. And we've got a lot of connections with employers and in different industries and those sectors to be able to help you open some doors. So medical biotech specifically, why would you come and do it? There is many career options in policy. In this particular case, this slide probably needs to be changed because those kind of jobs with regard to public health, hospital and diagnostic medical lab, they are better serviced in the medical laboratory science degree. Speaker1: But those policy options in government departments or pharmaceutical or biotech companies, you will get that knowledge and experience by doing medical biotech. Again, we do industry relevant subjects where we want to give you a broad range of skills in really practical based subjects - microscopy, proteomics and protein analysis, genetics and genetic analysis, and especially experimental design, where you can go out and an employer will give you a problem and you'll be able to dig back into the tool kit that we have provided for you to be able to understand how to solve that problem. The admission requirements, really, you need to have a undergraduate degree in science that involves some kind of biomolecular based subjects - molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, things like that. We need you to have a basic understanding of those molecular aspects of science so that you will be able to quickly get on top of the content. So there's a few different flavors that you can actually do. And after I just said that we prefer you to have a background in those bio molecular based sciences. If you don't, what you could do is enroll yourself into a graduate certificate, do a couple of the compulsory subjects, and prove to me that you can handle the content and then take that and move into one of the other programs. But these are the different ranges of programs that you'll have. I'll go into each one of these individually now, I believe. Speaker1: So first you've got the smallest part of it is just a graduate certificate where you do two elective subjects. Depending on when you come into the course, you'll either do microscopy and flow cytometry has now been replaced by bio nanotechnology or you come in and you would do biotech solutions and proteomics, but you would also do a number of professional electives where you would do scientific writing, communication subjects and things like that. So if you didn't really have a background in molecular based science, but you want to get into it, you can enroll into this and basically prove to us that you can handle the content, prove to yourself that this is something that you're really, really interested in. Because if you complete this and you want to then go on to say the graduate diploma, the subjects that you've done in the graduate certificate, you could count for credit into the graduate diploma where you do a full year, you would do all of the core subjects. Plus you've got a number of professional subjects that you could do, such as innovation, laboratory management, so on and so forth. What most people then go into is they go into the the full degree, which is the Master of Medical Biotech. This is one and one half years full time where you do 72 credit points. So you do all of the core subjects that we've described, the professional subjects such as advanced communications in science and understanding data science. Speaker1: But you also do a number of other credentials about writing proposals and reports, understanding experimental design, so on and so forth. If you want more subjects on top of that. And a lot of places require a two year degree. For instance, if you're an international student and you want to be applying for residency, you need to do a two year program, which is why people enroll in extension. And that's just more opportunity to do research based subjects and other subjects to give you even more and more experience and more and more understanding, to set you up better for whatever career in med biotech that you want to choose. Now, some of you might want to engage in a research career, and the way that we do that is you enroll in the Master of Medical Biotechnology. You complete your first year worth of your core subjects and your other compulsory subjects, and then you apply to transfer into the master of philosophy and medical biotech. And so all of those coursework subjects where you're learning how to do practical science, where you're learning all of these useful skills, you can then take those and transfer them into a full year research project working in the laboratory. Now you have to find yourself a supervisor, from and there are projects within and without the university, and the supervisor then has to have enough resources to be able to take you on for that project. Speaker1: And you would spend a full year working for that academic in their research lab, writing a thesis, doing various presentations. And so this is very, very similar to what's called the Bologna model that the majority of universities in Europe and North America use, where you go from undergrad to a master's degree that has a research component, then onto a PhD. So this is recognized by all the universities in the world. If you want this as a stepping stone to a research career and to a PhD. So how do you apply? Very, very simple. You go on to the website that's mentioned on the screen there. If you wanted to enroll in the coming spring semester, you'd need to get your application in by the 26th of June. But you could also wait until autumn next year, which starts in March and make decisions there. I have also had students who have started in the summer semester where they apply, they get accepted, they start in summer and they start to do electives and other subjects to be able to to be able to do those courses. Someone's asked a question, is there a required GPA? Not strictly. What I look for in, so I and the person that basically says the yes or no, I look at your academic transcript. And I look at that and I say, with your academic transcript, do I believe that you can handle the content? And so because an undergraduate degree and your undergraduate program is not necessarily a reflection of how you may do in Masters, you may have had trouble adjusting to university and, or you've gone out to do a work to do work and things like that. Speaker1: What I would then do is look at the subjects that you've done. And the other experience that you have and make a decision based on that. So if I had to say a credit average, yes, a credit average would get you in because like I said, you would then need to I would then basically say, okay, I think that you can probably handle the content. It's now up to you to put the work in. I can't make a comment on specific degrees that would get you in. It's a case by case basis. There's another just quick question. Are there any available scholarship coursework masters? No, not to my knowledge. So you would have to go and look up. There's a scholarships page that you can find on the UTS website that lists all of the scholarships that are available. But for local students, I don't believe that there are scholarships available for international students. You would have to look at your country of origin, your actual country that you are in. There are some scholarships available in different countries to study at Australian universities. Speaker1: You would have to look at that within your own country. Right. Moving right along. Okay. So there's some information about how much that it actually is going to cost you to do this. You can calculate the fees that you were going to get from the fee calculator that's on the web there. There's also there's the information about scholarships where you can actually email and ask those kinds of questions. A question has come up in the chat. Are there academic advisors who I can talk to if I'm tossing out which postgrad course to do normally, you would email either through to the generic science address and they can direct you to those various people. And normally you'll get directed to the program directors such as myself of the different things, we would look at what background you have, ask you questions about what your motivations are, what your career, what careers you want to think about and things like that, and then try and give you advice based on your individual circumstance. Now what's on the next slide? Recognition of prior learning. It depends - if you are a UTS student who is looking to go on to Masters. No, there will not be any recognized prior learning because everything that we do in Masters is very, very different to what you do in undergraduate subjects at UTS. Other universities, it's on a case by case basis. Speaker1: What you would have to do is look at the content of a particular subject that is part of the degree, look at the subject that you have actually undertaken, and write a justification to say, what was it in that subject that means that you've already covered the content in the subjects that we are going to teach you. You would send that to me and then I would look at that and basically say a yes or no, whether I think that you have already covered the content that we are going to teach you in that subject. So it is very much a case by case basis. The English language requirements are there. It's very, very important that your writing and English language skills are at that level, because if they are not, you are going to struggle. We do have means in place to be able to help you if you are having problems with your English language and comprehension. The university and the program particularly has ways of providing you with assistance and sending you to places for assistance. But it's really important that you've got these skills up front. So beyond just our master's postgraduate coursework, but there are other types of coursework. For instance, you can do a four year Masters of Science by Research. That's a two year full time in the laboratory program. You need to find a supervisor that is willing to take you on to be able to do that. Speaker1: Not a lot of students choose to do this because they find that it is far more beneficial to do Masters of Medical Biotech, where they do that one year worth of coursework, where they learn a whole heap of practical skills, that they can then translate into a research project and come out the end with with that master's degree in the same amount of time, but have a greater diversity of skills. And then they do that research project, which they can then take those skills and carry them on to a PhD, either within the university, if you get on well enough with your supervisor and you're enjoying yourself or taking it to another university anywhere in the world. A number of our students who have completed master philosophy and med biotech have gone on to PhD scholarships in Europe and the United States. There's also short forms of learning, like if you just want to test yourself out on UTS Open, you can do a number of our micro credentials. So these micro credentials that are on UTS online, you can do those and undertake an exam and get credit and those particular short courses, you could use those as recognised prior learning into the master's program because they are actually subjects that are available within that. So you could turn up, do those subjects and go, Yep, I'm really enjoying the way that UTS does its learning. Speaker1: I'm going to apply to do a full postgraduate degree and apply to have that recognised and I would look at that and go, yes, no worries, that's recognise prior learning, that's now less time and less money that you have to spend getting your full master's degree. So the next step in the process, if you want to have more information, is we are running a face to face post-graduate information evening on the 15th of June on the university campus. So you can turn up, you can talk to me, you can talk to other academics, you can talk to current students, you can talk to the admissions people face to face. You can actually talk to a real person rather than a screen. So this is a wonderful way to get all of your eclectic questions answered right there, face to face with us. After that, that face to face, if you still need more and more information about weighing up options and whether or not UTS is the place that you want to come, what particular course you can do. You can also register for these 15 minute consultations that will be scheduled somewhere within the 16th to the 24th of June. We haven't actually decided when the ones for medical biotech are going to be, but that will be available some time after the info night. So you can register for those consultations and you'll be given a range of times that you can communicate with me. Speaker1: And yes, it says 15 minutes. If I don't have any back to back consultations, it can go longer. It just depends if someone else is registered in the next 15 minutes, I'll have to cut it short, but I often give you email, address and other options to continue the conversation if you want to. If I want to go into clinical trials, is this course suitable? Yes, I would believe so, because what we do is we teach you a lot about data science and analytics, where we teach you a number of micro credentials about the different aspects of not only doing science and understanding those things, but also there is a micro credential in clinical trials. I'm just trying to remember. Yeah, clinical trials, evidence and design. So that's one subject. But there are numerous other subjects that you could do with, especially innovation and commercialisation, that would be suitable to get you more and more information about going into that kind of career. What are some of the jokes that people have graduated ended up doing? Look, the majority of people who come through in this particular degree do tend to end up in research careers because a lot of them then move on from doing, they do their coursework and then they typically move into the full year research program. So they typically do end up in laboratory and research jobs within the biotech industry, either in Australia or overseas, or they move into PhD programs. So there are some graduates who have ended up in jobs with New South Wales Health, and those kind of other policy areas. But the majority of people do end up going into research careers. If I'm really interested in genetics and genetic engineering, is this the right course for me? There are a number of subjects within genetics, genetic testing, genomics and precision medicine, things like that. Actual genetic engineering, which is more a strictly full on biotech approach, we will talk about those in various different subjects where we talk about cloning and expression and genetic engineering and things like that. And there is not an actual dedicated, postgraduate subject in that, to my knowledge. However, you could do a research project where you could do a smaller research project either 8, 16 or 24 credit points in one semester to actually go and work with an academic on a genetic engineering project. There are a few of those where people are still doing cloning and expression work within their research projects. So that would be the way to get that would be actually to do a research project. What's the main difference between med biotech and biomed engineering? Lots. So biomed engineering is a lot more about the design of medical devices and how to build those kinds of things. Whereas med biotech is more about performing the research to understand the biology that would then go into developing those kind of devices. There is an overlap within a few of the subjects in both of them, but there are subjects such as proteomics, microscopy, biotech solutions. The core subjects of medical, biotech are not available in biomed engineering, and they have subjects that are not available to buy to medical biotech. So you would be best having them open in two web browsers side by side and looking at the differences in the subjects that are being taught. There is overlap, but there is some quite distinct differences. I think everyone's got their got their questions answered. If, as I said, we have the face to face information coming up where you can attend and come and talk to me and talk to other academics. We have the one on one sessions that you can register for to talk to me further about these things. If you want to email me beforehand, you can look me up on the UTS website. Just go search UTS Matt Padula and I'll be the first thing that comes up and feel free to send me an email and I can answer more questions. But otherwise, unless there's no other questions, I will bid you all a good night and hope you have a wonderful week and hopefully I will see you at an info session or in-person sometime soon. Thanks very much and good night. Cathy: Well good evening everybody and welcome. It's great to see that so many of you decided to join us today and there are still people coming in, so welcome to them as they arrive. Just before we begin, I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation on whose ancestral lands our city campus now stands. I pay respect to the elders, both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of our knowledge for this land. Now I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Associate Professor Cathy Gorrie. I'm a Senior Lecturer here in the School of Life Sciences, and I'm also the Program Director for the Medical Laboratory Science suite of Postgraduate Courses. In this session, I'm just going to do a brief introduction to post-graduate science and why it's good to study at UTS. Then I'm going to do a program overview of two of the courses that are offered in the Medical Laboratory Science stream, followed by some essential information and most importantly, how to apply. Okay. So why would you want to do postgraduate coursework in science at UTS? So basically, if you're starting your career or if you're already an established scientist, you can actually plan a course of study that suits you, puts you in the centre of your own learning. Many of our courses will give you experience in professional skills, and all of our courses will touch on things like communication, innovation, and how that can be commercialised in many instances. Cathy: And the courses I'm going to talk about today are actually all offered online. So we've got a very flexible approach to study and for medical laboratory science in particular, the Graduate Certificate and the Graduate Diploma are completely online. So again, UTS Science tries to offer postgraduate coursework that is informed by research that is undertaken by academics who are leaders in their field. So UTS is ranked above world standard in all our scientific disciplines and we've also got a lot of industry connections, in particular partners like New South Wales Health Pathology and some of the private pathology laboratories in Sydney and New South Wales. So specifically, I'm going to talk about Medical Laboratory Science today. These courses are very much designed to enable you to progress in your chosen career. So if you've already got an undergraduate science degree and you want to learn more about medical laboratory science disciplines, or if you're already working as a medical laboratory scientist and you want to extend your knowledge, especially your theoretical knowledge. So some of the careers that might be open to you would be obviously working in hospital laboratories and also private pathology laboratories. Anything that's got a diagnostic medical laboratory or is involved maybe in research and design, like pharmaceutical companies, biomedical and biotechnology industries, and also biomedical science, information dissemination and education. All of these are the types of careers that you might be interested in. Cathy: I'm going to talk about two courses in particular tonight. One is the Graduate Certificate in Medical Laboratory Science. This is a six month full time course, so there's four subjects in it. Four six credit point subjects. And they cover disciplines like Medical Microbiology, which is bacteriology and virology, Diagnostic Pathology, which covers haematology and transfusion science and Biomolecular Science, which covers histology, molecular science and anatomical pathology. And there is also one free elective. So you have the option to choose another elective subject, and that's the Graduate Certificate. So that's six months full time or a year part time. Once you've completed the Graduate Certificate, you can then move on to the Graduate Diploma. So the first 24 credit points of the Graduate Diploma is made up of the Graduate Certificate courses, and then there is another option for another 24 credit points of subjects. And again, when we're talking about electives, we're talking about things like advanced communication skills and science diagnostics, cytogenetics laboratory management, risk assessment, quality control. So understanding data and statistical design, so these are all available as two, four or six credit points. And if you're enrolled in the Graduate Ciploma, you can also do the Professional Laboratory Portfolio, which is an advanced subject available to people already working in in a diagnostic laboratory, which enables them to extend a lot of the skills that they've already got. And there's a small research project and a small education project embedded in that. So these are options in the diploma. Cathy: If you're interested in applying for either of these, you need to do it through the uts.edu.au/pg-admissions. So all of the postgraduate courses go through the same portal. Applications are now open for the spring semester and they close on the 26th of June. So if you're thinking about applying for the next session at UTS, they need to be in by the 26th of June and you need to make sure that you attach all the required documentation to that application. Okay. Next. Cathy: Now, if you're interested in working out how much it's going to cost, you need to go to the fee calculator. It which is at fees.uts.edu.au. If you're a UTS alumni, so if you've already been a student and completed a course, you will automatically receive a discount and there may be scholarships available for some of the courses. If you've already studied at UTS, you may be eligible for some recognition of prior learning. And if you've done the Graduate Certificate, you'll get an advanced standing for those subjects in the Graduate Diploma. You do need to have English language proficiency scores of 6.5 or 6. And if you want to go on and do further study at UTS, you can look into doing a Master of Science. Now you can do a coursework version of that which has a medical laboratory major, or you might want to do research degrees as a Doctor of Philosophy or Master of Science (Research). So there's a lot more information on the UTS websites. Go to future students at Science. OK. And there's also a number of short courses in medical science and some of these are now offered as our elective subjects, or you can do them as standalone subjects before you start. So if you want to try tertiary education, you can do a two credit point course, for example, diagnostic cytogenetics, and that will be credited in your Graduate Diploma. So lots of information at open.uts.edu.au about those short courses. Cathy: Okay. So I see there's already a question about this. If you want to come in and have face to face chats with us, there will be an information evening here at UTS on the 15th of June in the evening. And you can register for that through events page. All this information will be emailed to you after the session. So all of these websites you'll get in writing. But this is a face to face chat with academics, and if you're unable to make that, you can also register for one on one Zoom chat, which will be the following week, and there'll be 15 minute consultations available. So either of those options, you either come in and see the campus and meet the academics or have a one on one chat. Okay. Now we've got a few minutes left. If people have got questions, I can see there's a couple there coming up in Q and A. So I've talked I've answered the one about the campus info sessions, 15th of June, which is a Wednesday evening, 5 to 7. A question, I've previously started a postgraduate degree. Can I get credit off a UTS degree? Yes, it will depend on the degree that you've completed and the subject. So you need to be able to match subjects one on one and it's done on a case by case basis. So once you have accepted your offer, then you would apply for recognition of prior learning. So you may be able to get credit. Usually up to half a course is the maximum that you would be able to get credit for. Okay. I've got a question here about Commonwealth supported places in each course. So it's unusual that there are Commonwealth supported places for postgraduate study and at the moment we have, as far as we know, there aren't Commonwealth supported places for 2023 and I will... on application you should always tick the box for Commonwealth supported places. We don't know what the availability is at the moment, so I can't answer that question with a number. I'm sorry about that. Cathy: Okay. So if you contact... if you go to the website for future students, there are links to the research, sorry to the student info team and they'll be able to answer those administrative queries about your application. So there are links on the website and you can ask questions specifically about your application and about the admin processes. So go to that portal, register and then you'll be able to see who to ask about those. Cathy: Okay. The semester dates for spring 2020. We are going to start on August the 1st, I think it is. Let me just have a look. Oh. Yes. It's in August. I just got to find the dates. Okay. Just here we are. Thank you very much. Session starts on the 1st of August. Okay. So it goes from August to about November. It's 12 weeks in a session and the last day to accept your offer and enrol is the 15th of August. So if you're late in making a decision, you can apply late. You'll miss the first few weeks, but you must be enrolled by the 15th of August. And there is also a Stuvac week in the middle of the session. So there's a break from teaching in September, so 26th of September to the 2nd of October. Okay. Remember, your applications are due by the 26th of June but you need to accept your offer. The last date you can accept your offer would be the 15th of August. Okay. Cathy: Will the recordings for these webinars be available afterwards? You'll be sent an email with all the relevant links after this, after the session, and they'll be able to provide links to recordings and the vital information that's available. Okay. Are there any pre requirements to apply for this course? Thank you. That's a really good question. So for the Graduate Certificate in Medical Laboratory Science and the Graduate Diploma in Medical Laboratory Science, you must have a science degree in a relevant field so that something like biology, cell biology, biomedical science, medical science, something like that. Or because we recognise that many people already in this industry, we also will accept a TAFE diploma in pathology testing and at least three years work experience. So when you apply, you must have a letter of support, you must have a letter of, a statement of service from your employer stating that you've been employed in this field for at least three years. So this is unusual in postgraduate study, but because of this field we have two options. So that's your pre requirements. We are looking for some basic knowledge about cell biology, anatomy and physiology. So, basic chemistry, so fairly basic introductory science subjects. And it will be helpful if you've done some molecular science, some general microbiology and some general biomedical science type subjects. Cathy: Okay, what support services are available to international postgraduate students? The Graduate Certificate and Graduate Diploma are not available to international postgraduate students, but there are lots of other courses that are. And then we have a international unit who can help support international students. So again, go to the websites for future students and all of those links will be there showing where the support services are. So they are there. Okay. For a student who's just finished a Bachelor, which postgraduate course do you think is most suitable? Okay. It very much depends on what your interests are. If you would like a career in a diagnostic laboratory, which is very specific to those sorts of disciplines that I've mentioned in the subjects, then you can start with the Graduate Certificate. And then if you find that you want to continue on with postgraduate study, you can then continue into the Diploma and you can continue into a Masters. It depends on what. If you've done a general Bachelor of Science, then I would recommend doing the Graduate Certificate. If you've already done a Bachelor of Biomedical Science, you will have covered a lot of the material that's in our postgraduate study in this specific postgraduate study, and you might want to consider a more general Master of Science degree. Okay. Of what types of jobs? Well, the main job that these degrees are aimed at is diagnostic medical pathology labs, either in hospitals or in private pathology companies or in associated industries. Cathy: Can you do Medical Laboratory and apply for a post-grad research following? You would need to... Yes, you can. So you need to complete your tertiary qualification. And as long as it's a relevant field to the PhD, you would be eligible to apply. You will still need to have a supervisor lined up to do postgraduate research either at the Masters or the PhD level. But my understanding is the Graduate Diploma, Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma is sufficient to apply for those postgraduate research positions. No. There is no minimum GPA required for undergraduate degrees to enrol in the Graduate Certificate or the Diploma. As long as you have a degree in a relevant field and you've covered the basic introductory science subjects, you'll be okay. So it's notdone on your academic marks, it's done on your knowledge base, right? Okay. So that's great. That's a lot of questions covered. Again. What I'd just like to iterate with these courses is that they are stepped in such a way that you can start by enrolling in the Graduate Certificate for six months and then you can continue on and enroll in the Graduate Diploma and then you can continue on and enrol in the Master of Science. So you don't need to make the decision straight up. You can enrol, see how you go, and then continue on with your academic progression. Also, you can complete these courses part time or full time. So if you're working full time, these are designed for those students. So there's a lot of flexibility in the way that the courses are taught. There's a lot of self-directed learning, a lot of flexibility on assignment submission dates and attendance patterns. So it's really designed for people that are already in the workforce and it will accommodate people that are already in the workforce, wherever you may be in Australia. Okay. So if you've anybody got any last minute questions they'd like me to answer, we've got a few more minutes? No? So the team will send out an email to you all with the links to that I've spoken about and the essential information about enrolling at UTS. If you want more information on a 1 to 1 basis, please register for either the information evening or for one of the one on one chats and you can ask your specific questions. You may have had the opportunity to think about different courses. Tomorrow night there's another webinar about the Master of Science, which includes all the different majors. So there's a Master of Science with a major in medical laboratory science and other majors. So if you're not sure about your options, come and have a look, come and register for that one as well and you'll learn a little bit more about some of the other opportunities. Okay. Cathy: So we've got about 5 minutes to go. I finished a little bit early. I'm more than happy to take additional questions or I'll just stay on the line if you think of anything for a little bit. Otherwise, I hope to see you at one of our information sessions, or even better, hope to see you enrolled in this course next session or the following one. I've just got another question. Do any of the postgraduate degrees require placements? They don't require placements. You don't have to have a placement in order to do postgraduate degrees. Some of our postgraduate degrees may have internships as part of the course. Not all of them. And the medical laboratory science ones don't have internship placements as part of the course. Yes, there is the opportunity to take some partial electives on campus. Some of our elective subjects, certainly in the Master of Science, do have on campus electives. So if you want to do some practical skills, then think about enrolling in the Master of Science, majoring in medical laboratory science, and there'll be some practical classes on campus. Okay. Well, that's great. I think we'll finish up there. Lovely to see you all and look forward to meeting you again. Bye bye. Speaker1: I'd like to welcome you all to the webinar for information on the quantitative finance programs at UTS. Before we start, there's a bit of housekeeping that will just go through. So just to give you a bit of an outline of the session, it's meant to you're welcome to ask questions. You can type your questions in the Q&A window, and I'll give a bit of an introduction about postgraduate study in general at UTS. Why choose UTS? Then we'll do a bit of a program overview of the various programs at UTS. And I'll give you a bit of information about the essential elements or essential information about the various courses and some information on how to apply. So just to give you a bit of background about why you should choose postgraduate coursework at UTS, there are several reasons. Firstly, we provide real world skills, so you'll gain practical hands on experience in your preferred discipline, as well as the professional skills required in things like communication, innovation, commercialisation. And that will all add to your marketability as a graduate of UTS, as a postgraduate, a graduate of a postgraduate program, if you like, and of course, it will all improve your employability. We provide a flexible approach in studying. So we try and provide a mix of face to face and online content for you to study through for the finance programs, certainly the Master of Quantitative Finance. In the master content of finance, for example, all of our classes are evening classes and, in general in the UTS postgraduate coursework, all compulsory subjects have evening classes. So if you're working this way, it gives you flexibility without interrupting your work life if you like. We also have world class facilities, so you will get access to specialized laboratories and other facilities with the latest cutting edge technologies, which again, will give you really important and practical skills when you enter into your appropriate chosen careers. So all of these factors make postgraduate studies at UTS very attractive, I think. We also have research that is world leading and it shapes the world, if you like. So you will be learning from academics who are leaders in their fields. And we're ranked above all standard in our in all of our scientific disciplines. If you look at the report, Excellence in Research Australia in 2018. We're heavily industry connected, so we have quite a lot of active connections, if you like, with employers. Whether it's private industry or the public sector through our research activities and also through our graduates who have been placed all over the industry across Australia and internationally. So that also gives us a cutting edge in terms of the projects and the way we, I guess teach, post-graduate subjects as well as the relevance and the viability of our subjects with respect to real world skills and knowledge. Speaker1: And that brings us specifically now to quantitative finance programs at UTS. Now we have several. So the courses we offer are the Master of Quantitative Finance, which is our flagship program. We also have a graduate certificate in mathematics, which can be used as a stepping stone to enter into the Master of Quantitative Finance. We have the Master of Data Science and Quantitative Finance, which is a new program, and the Master of Mathematics and Quantitative Finance, which is again, relatively new. So the Master of Mathematics and Quantitative Finance is designed for those candidates who are looking to study quantitative finance but don't have the relevant quantitative background. So in that program, in the master mathematics and quantitative finance, our objective is to try and skill up in the mathematics that's required to for you to be successful in the quantitative finance subjects. And the Master of Data Science in Quantitative Finance combines the quantitative finance subjects with specialized data science subjects in quantitative finance. And for that program, you're required to have substantial quantitative background that you've achieved through your prior studies. Now in terms of the career options resulting from the quantitative, the various quantitative, the masters programs, whether it's Master of Finance, Master of Data Science and Quantitative Finance, or the Master of Mathematics and Quantitative Finance, you have a wide variety of career options open to you once you graduate, and in some cases before you graduate. So the sort of career options that will be available to you include working as a quantitative analyst, as a risk management analyst, as a quantitative structurer, as a developer, as a trader, as an investment analyst, or in a financial engineering position within financial institutions, all of those can be with financial institutions or in some cases, pension funds or hedge funds. There will also be opportunities in data science or working as a data analyst. Or a forecaster or even a consultant with the top consulting firms. So there's a huge range of career options available to you at the end of these programs. Now, in terms of the level of study that you should choose, well, that will depend really on where you want to go with your program, with your studies. So obviously, the basic level or the primary entry point would be Graduate Certificate in Mathematics if you don't have sufficient quantitative background. Although if you're looking to study quantitative finance now, we strongly recommend that you choose the Master of Mathematics and Quantitative Finance in the event that you don't have sufficient quantitative background. So just to give you an example, if you've done a Bachelor of Commerce or a Bachelor of Business, then we would strongly recommend, unless you've done some specialised mathematics subjects or statistics subjects, then we would say, look, the master of mathematics and quantitative finance would be an appropriate degree. If you've come from an engineering or an actuarial background or a mathematics or statistical background or computer science background with a substantial maths component, then we recommend you come in through the Master of Quantitative Finance or the Master of Data Science in Quantitative Finance. Speaker1: Now, just to give you a bit of a breakdown. So with the Master of Quantitative Finance, for example. You know, this program is a 72 credit point program and it can be completed full time over three semesters in a 12 month period where you take you take 24 credit points of study each semester, whether it be autumn, spring and summer or spring, summer, autumn. Okay. Now, the Master of Mathematics and Quantitative Finance and the Master of Data Science in Quantitative Finance are both three full time programs. Okay, in which case you again, take each for each of the four semesters, 24 credit points each semester. Okay. Now, of course, there are some exit possibilities at the graduate diploma, as an exit point, if you need to exit before you complete your Master's program. So there are some exit strategies if you needed them. Okay. And of course, you can study part time. So starting with the Master of Quantitative Finance, this is actually a 12 month full time program. So you do have to complete three semesters. But if you start in autumn, you will complete autumn, spring and summer if you're a full time student. Speaker1: Which means you can actually complete in 12 months or full time or 24 months part time. And these are the subjects that you you will have to complete. So essentially, if you start in autumn, you would start with statistics and financial econometrics, fundamentals of derivative security pricing, financial market instruments. In spring, you would complete probability theory and stochastic analysis, risk management, interest rates and credit risk models. And then in the summer you will complete computational methods and model implementation, numerical methods in finance and quantitative portfolio analysis. And again, the attendance mode is blended. So what we try and do now is have as many of the lectures recorded and available to you online, and we have face to face tutorials or drop in centers or workshops. Of course, that could change in future, but that's the current framework for attendance. Now with a Master of Quantitative Finance. We view that program as a fully integrated, postgraduate coursework degree. We focus on areas in financial economics, financial mathematics and computational methods. The program focuses on all aspects of derivative security pricing, financial engineering and risk management in all its aspects. And we do draw upon the research strength in quantitative finance to deliver a very high level quality academic program. Directed at real world applications. So we do provide you with all the necessary rigorous theory that you require, and we combine that with a wide range of practical, real world assignments using real world data and requiring quite a lot of programming. Speaker1: Now the objectives of the master content of finance, there are several of these. So firstly, we aim to meet the need for rigorous and advanced training in the theoretical and applied aspects of quantitative finance that we believe are required for today's for the measurement and management of risk in today's highly complex financial markets. We aim to provide a solid and integrated understanding of the various quantitative tools from financial economic theory, probability theory, stochastic analysis, numerical methods and computing. We believe all of these skills and tools are extremely vital for a successful career in the financial industry. Of course the degree prepares or aims to prepare students for a wide range of careers. As I mentioned before, in areas including financial engineering, risk management, quantitative asset management, financial forecasting, quant trading and applied financial research to name a few. Okay, now, with a Master of Mathematics and Quantitative Finance, well, this will combine 24 credit points of mathematics subjects that are done before you move on to the quantitative finance subjects. The math subjects that you would need to complete are the postgraduate mathematics, postgraduate statistics, and postgraduate programming. And it's a 96 point degree because we combine 72 credit points from finance and then mathematics 24 credit points. It's a two year full time program or four years of part time study. Speaker1: And again, it's a mix of online and face to face attendance. So essentially, we use this program to prepare students with more of the mathematical background that they may not have to allow them to succeed in the finance subjects. Now for the Master of Data Science and Quantitative Finance. So again, what we do here is we try and combine the quantitative finance, the Master of Quant Finance subjects with some data science, specialized data science subjects developed specially for this program. And the data science subjects are machine learning, mathematical theory and applications, advanced Bayesian methods and nonlinear methods in quantitative management. Okay. And then, of course, we have the graduate certificate in mathematics. So again, really, this is just the upskill in mathematics. You know, assuming you haven't had a lot of exposure to mathematical subjects or specialized mathematics subjects in your previous studies. Okay. Now in terms of applications, so you can apply for admission online at UTS. You drive forward slash PG admissions. If you're looking to start in spring session, then the applications are currently open and they'll close on the 26th of June. So you have a little bit of time to think about it and hopefully you'll get your applications in. And if you're looking to start in autumn next year, then the applications for that will open in September 22, later on this year. And if you're an international student, then you'll need to contact the international office at international.uts.edu.au for admission deadlines. This is quite important information as well in terms of the fees. So you can see essentially it's $877 per credit point plan in 2022. And if you study for one year full time, so two semesters, that would be 48 credit points. But in the for the Master of Finance, remember the entire program is three semesters and can be completed in 12 months. It's 72 credit points unless you get recognition of prior learning. If you've completed your undergraduate. So if you're an alumni, a UTS alumni, you'll receive a 10% discount, which is actually great. And you may be interested to look up scholarship information, although there aren't too many scholarships really for the finance programs. But you're welcome to look at those. Okay. So there's also some information about recognition of prior learning, depending on what your previous studies, you know, the area that your previous studies were in, you may be eligible for some exemptions or recognition of prior learning, which means that you will be able to count some of your previous studies towards your degree. But there are some limitations, of course. So if you go to uts.edu.au/recognition-prio—learning. You will find application forms and all the rules and regulations around that. And there is an English language requirement if you've completed your previous studies in a language other than English. Speaker1: So the academic requirement is 6.5 overall with a writing requirement of 6. And again, you can go to uts.edu.au/english-language-requirements for all the requirements on that. Now there are also possibilities for higher degree research following the Masters content will follow in any of those Masters if you're interested. So you may be interested and you may actually depending on what you've already studied. You may be interested in either PhD or Master of Science in Mathematics Research. Again, we have information. You've got the website there for research courses and you can contact science.research@uts.edu.au if you need further information. We also support the idea of lifelong learning at UTS. So there are some short courses in mathematics that you may also be interested in. One of them is understanding data. Well, actually the all around understanding that one is for statistical models, one is around linear regression models. And we also have one about again, understanding data around population will make in population statements and samples. So if you're interested in those short courses, you can go to open.uts.edu.au for more details. So another important piece of information is that we have a face to face event. So a science postgraduate information evening. This will give you access to academics, current students and admissions staff. And that will be held on the on Wednesday the 15th of June this year from 5 to 7 p.m.. Speaker1: And you can find more information at the website that's showing on the slide. That's actually might be a very useful event for you if you would like more information. If you're looking to sort of have a chat with academics teaching in the course or current students undertaking the course. So I think that would be a really useful thing to do. And we also have an event for one on one chats with us so you can discuss your options with an academic expert or in terms of what your options are for postgraduate studies. You might also have an opportunity to talk to current postgraduate students. So we have 15 minute consultation slots available between the 16th and the 24th of June. And so these are online. So you can register on the website showing on the screen, so you can either do one on one chats online or you can do, you come in and you face to face chats with us at the postgraduate information evening on the 15th of June. So I do, I guess, recommend that you might think about doing those. If you're unsure, if you want more information that we can't sort of provide tonight. And so I guess we've got a question about how does a degree compare to other degrees from other universities? Well, firstly, I think a degree is a highly specialised degree. All of the subjects were designed specifically for the Master of Quantitative Finance, and the subjects were redesigned, I think the most recent over the last four years to incorporate a lot more practical components. So we do I guess the other aspect of our degree is that we provide a combination of rigorous theory with a lot of practical applications. Okay. Now I've got another question about how our classes are delivered. Well, as I said, we use a blended mode. So where we have online recorded lectures mostly. And then we have face to face where possible, tutorials and workshops. We also have tutorials and workshops. We also have consultations both online and face to face. Do all of the degrees start in spring? Yes. What support services are available to postgraduate students? I might just answer that live. So we do have a maths study centre. We also have a counselling service and as I said, we have support in terms of, I'm not sure if I understand the question properly, but we have academic staff involved in our programmes, have regular consultations to provide students with additional educational support. And our face to face workshops are really designed to enhance your learning experiences. So the study center will provide some specialized sort of one on one assistance if you're having problems with some of the mathematical or statistical aspects of the program, although that's probably going to be confined to the earlier math subjects rather than some of the quant finance subjects which involve much more specialized, high level mathematics. So if you're not sure which is the right program for you, I recommend that you attend the June post-graduate information evening where you can have a chat to me face to face, or you can always send an email in the meantime if you want an answer before then or you can make a phone call, I'm happy to discuss with you. So another question about what what sort of maths is required. Look, probably the most difficult aspect of the degree is the stochastic analysis because it's not all that well covered in our undergraduate programs in Australia. Stochastic analysis background would be great, but we're not, we don't specifically look for that. So if you've done an applied maths degree or a pure maths degree, that would be fantastic. It would help also if you have some programming background, but it doesn't matter because you learn the programming along the way. So you do need to know sort of multivariate calculus. For example, calculus. Linear algebra is important. Differential or differential equations are important. Numerical methods are important. I think I've answered most of the questions. If you have additional questions, I'm happy to answer those if you send an email through. Yeah. So I'll also be, of course, attending the June post-graduate, the face to face information evening and I'll be available as well for the online 15 minute chats later on.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/orthoptics-courses/orthoptics-faq,"Get all the information you need before you kick-start your dream job in allied health as an eye-therapist, eye technology expert and health educator – an orthoptist! Check out some of our most frequently asked questions about the UTS Master of Orthoptics, asked by future university students just like you. If you have a question about postgraduate study at UTS, get in touch. An orthoptist is an eye therapist who conducts eye tests and provides therapy in order to help people manage their eye problems. Orthoptists traditionally provided care and treatment for patients with eye movement disorders. More recently, orthoptists have expanded their role and are also involved in the care of patients with eye disease such as cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic eye disease, age related macular degeneration, systemic or neurological vision disorders and low vision. Orthoptists work in many areas including neonatal care, paediatrics, rehabilitation, geriatrics, neurological impairment, community services and ophthalmic technology. Orthoptists are registered with the Australian Orthoptic Board. People visit orthoptists for many reasons, with care being provided for a number of disorders. Some examples include: Orthoptists provide tertiary health care in the management of paediatric and neurological disorders of the eye on referral from specialist medical practitioners. They also provide therapy to optimise the visual function of people with low vision. They give primary care in screening programs and work in multi-disciplinary teams to deliver secondary health care to a wide range of patients. Where Orthoptists differ from Optometrists is that Orthoptists are therapists and are employed in hospitals, go to operating theatres, assist in minor surgical procedures, work with neurologists as well as Ophthalmologists as part of medical teams, work in the rehabilitation of stroke survivors, and assist people afflicted with brain injury and developmental delay. An Orthoptist is a clinician who specialises in the assessment, diagnosis and non-surgical treatment, management, and rehabilitation of patients with eye disorders. Orthoptists apply evidence-based practice in the treatment of patients requiring specialist care to restore sight and maximise ocular comfort. While Orthoptists can prescribe glasses, they primarily do this for therapeutic purposes and use non-surgical approaches for management of eye conditions. An optometrist is a graduate in Bachelor of Optometry, licensed to practice optometry. Optometrists determine the need for glasses and contact lenses, prescribe optical correction, and screen for abnormalities of the eye. They primarily work in shopfront practices offering primary eye care. An ophthalmologist is a specialist medical doctor who is licensed to practice medicine and surgery. He or she diagnoses and treats all eye diseases, performs eye surgery, and prescribes ocular medications for the management of conditions such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Orthoptists can work as front line health care providers depending on the setting in which they operate. Orthoptists work in many areas including neonatal care, paediatrics, rehabilitation, geriatrics, neurological impairment, community services and ophthalmic technology. A day in the life of an orthoptist can be quite varied. Orthoptists can deliver front line health care in settings such as the NSW StEPS vision screening program for pre-school children. They can complete voluntary service overseas and work across the wide spectrum of eye health care, but can also specialise in one area of practice. 00:00 [Music] 00:05 hello everyone we'll get started 00:07 everyone settled I firstly just like to 00:11 ignore it meet on the land of the 00:12 gadigal people of the eora nation 00:13 tonight we acknowledge them as 00:16 traditional custodians of knowledge for 00:17 this place indigenous australians have 00:20 been on this land as we know for around 00:21 60,000 years and in that time they've 00:23 developed communities they've duel at 00:26 languages a deep culture and a 00:28 connection to country their work played 00:30 loved and parented they built family and 00:33 they nurtured this land and they remain 00:35 deeply connected to country I 00:36 acknowledge elders past present and 00:39 those emerging in the future and also in 00:42 the average from Transat Islander people 00:43 who happen to be here with us tonight 00:45 I welcome to you all it's wonderful to 00:48 see so many enthusiastic faces here with 00:50 us this evening you come from a broad 00:52 background and I think for many of you 00:54 you probably haven't decided which 00:55 discipline you may eventually journey 00:57 into with you're going to take that 00:59 journey at all but tonight it's a 01:00 wonderful opportunity to hear from 01:01 clinicians as they talk about what they 01:04 do every day in their work and it's 01:06 quite unique I think to have this 01:07 opportunity because sometimes you think 01:09 you might know for example what a speech 01:10 pathologist does I was certainly learned 01:12 since I've been in the Graduate School 01:14 of Health a lot more about these 01:15 disciplines than I thought and having 01:18 thought already knew a little bit anyhow 01:19 I come from a background as a nurse and 01:21 a midwife so I've worked in the hospital 01:23 setting and I thought yeah I've got a 01:24 pretty good idea but when they start 01:26 talking about their deep understanding 01:28 of their discipline and the passion they 01:30 have I really learned a lot more and I'm 01:32 sure that'll come out tonight as we 01:34 listen to each of our clinicians who are 01:36 here present so my name's Joanne gray 01:39 I'm the head of the Graduate School of 01:40 Health I've been in the school now for 01:42 about nine months and as I said I come 01:44 from a background of being a nurse and a 01:45 midwife from the Faculty of Health so 01:47 this has been a lovely change to work 01:49 with a different range of disciplines 01:50 which has been great as you know 01:52 tonight's the event is being filmed and 01:54 if later when you ask a question we will 01:56 come to you with a microphone and ask 01:57 please that you speak into the 01:59 microphone the reason we're filming it 02:01 is because there's many people who can't 02:02 be here tonight and we know this is a 02:04 unique opportunity we don't expect our 02:05 clinicians to come back every week and 02:07 be so generous in their time so we are 02:10 wanting to film it and that these videos 02:12 we put up on the website 02:13 so that other people who are interested 02:14 in the programs we offer here are able 02:16 to go on and find those there's those 02:20 films the other thing I'm going to do is 02:22 ask you we're going to go deuce what's 02:23 called slider you probably all know what 02:25 it is but if we can just go to that 02:27 slide and I will ask you to set this up 02:29 on your phone now so this is where if 02:31 you go into your web browser and type in 02:34 if you wish to that web address and Kian 02:38 hashtag UTS gsh what you can then do is 02:43 you can pose questions and then you can 02:45 vote those questions up so wonder if you 02:46 might ask a particular question you 02:48 think I've always wanted to know the 02:49 answer but you didn't think of asking it 02:51 you can then click on that and you can 02:53 then decide that you think that's the 02:54 best question out there and you can push 02:56 that up to the top of the queue that's 02:58 just another way of us sort of getting 02:59 an idea of what it is you want to ask 03:01 you people don't feel free to always ask 03:03 the question themselves but there will 03:05 be an opportunity just for the old 03:06 fashioned put your hand up and you'd 03:07 like to ask somebody a question so I 03:10 will now go through and introduce our 03:12 speakers and we're very fortunate that 03:14 they're sitting in front of the banner 03:15 that belongs to their name due to their 03:17 profession and I promise you there are 03:18 no tricks so you will hear from Mitch's 03:21 and/or Thopter there so it's all going 03:23 to work out like that but I thought I'd 03:24 just let you know but they look very I 03:25 think it's very attractive sort of look 03:27 it we've got going here which is 03:28 wonderful and again thank you so much to 03:30 all of you for coming tonight 03:32 so I'll start fairly first with Helen 03:34 Benson Helen is an accredited pharmacist 03:36 and a practitioner teacher at the UTS 03:38 Graduate School of Health and Health 03:40

is our 06:27 physiotherapist she's an accredited 06:29 physiotherapist currently working in the 06:30 southeastern Sydney Health District as a 06:32 rehabilitation physiotherapist Georgia 06:35 is also a PhD candidate at the Graduate 06:37 School of Health with a research focus 06:39 on physiotherapy 06:40 neurology and allied health science and 06:42 focus on unilateral neglect in stroke 06:45 patients so it's amazing array of work 06:48 that these clinicians doing just reading 06:50 out all of those bits and pieces you can 06:51 see that the work of an allied health 06:52 professional just covers whole range of 06:55 areas and certainly across the lifespan 06:56 so there are a few questions that I've 06:58 got that I'm going to put to the 06:59 clinicians and just to a variety of them 07:02 remembering of course if there's 07:03 anything you want to particularly ask 07:04 there will be the opportunities so I'm 07:06 just going to start off and if you think 07:08 of anything else you want to ask maybe 07:09 jot it down or of course you can put it 07:11 up on the slide oh so I'm probably going 07:14 to just go fairly orderly to start with 07:16 and we'll see how that works out for us 07:17 so firstly Linda what does someone in 07:20 your profession do and what are your 07:21 main job tasks and where do you work 07:23 okay so I can talk from my own clinical 07:28 perspective and then I might just talk 07:30 about broadly how the profession is 07:33 situated so I work in private practice 07:35 our private practice works with people 07:38 across the lifespan so from young babies 07:41 who might have difficulty feeding all 07:42 the way through to someone in an aged 07:44 care facility who may have some 07:47 difficulties with communication or with 07:49 some mealtime management 07:51 so as a profession we work with people 07:54 in all stages of their lives as I 07:57 mentioned from babies right through to 07:59 aged care and we often assume that we 08:03 focus purely on speech or stuttering or 08:06 voice but speech pathology actually 08:09 covers communication which is reading 08:11 writing speaking and listening from 08:14 infants right through to aged so and 08:18 those settings can vary from working in 08:20 the clinic working in preschools in 08:22 hospitals where the focus is more on 08:26 rehabilitation so it might be working 08:28 with someone who's rehabilitating from 08:31 cancer treatment they might we might 08:34 work with people who have had a 08:35 laryngectomy or who have had some 08:41 recovery from a traumatic brain injury 08:42 so in terms of where you might be 08:45 working it could have a medical focus 08:47 educational focus if you're working in a 08:49 school or working in private 08:52 so there's opportunities to to kind of 08:55 follow whichever pathways someone's 08:57 preference a lot of choices yes thank 09:00 you so much I put the same question to 09:02 you this yeah yeah so I work at a 09:05 private practice in Western Sydney and 09:08 but I've kind of worked all over Sydney 09:11 in different roles and really as a North 09:14 Optus kind of part of our profession is 09:17 very much in terms of diagnostics and 09:20 opthalmic disease so we do lots of 09:24 imaging using very niche pieces of 09:28 equipment to look at different aspects 09:30 of the eye vision and perception which 09:33 is really interesting on it in itself 09:35 and that kind of goes hand-in-hand with 09:38 those patients who are pre and post 09:40 operative eye surgery so we do a lot 09:43 with assessing for people for laser eye 09:46 surgery but then also we've got a strong 09:49 therapy focus of course where we do a 09:51 lot to do with people with eye turns 09:54 whether they're born with those they 09:57 develop from neurological disease 09:59 processes or trauma and injury and we do 10:02 a lot in terms of correcting double 10:05 vision realigning people's eyes eye 10:07 patching and that goes yeah right down 10:10 from children to the elderly so it's 10:13 really quite diverse interesting great 10:16 thank you 10:17 okay so genetic counselors we work 10:21 alongside medical specialists so common 10:24 settings for genetic counselors to work 10:25 alongside oncologists cardiologists in 10:29 my case obstetrician/gynecologist s-- 10:32 geneticists and we work in a variety of 10:34 settings so Pediatrics neurology I'm in 10:38 Crean Adel at the moment assisted 10:40 reproductive technology and what we 10:41 really do is our goal is to translate 10:44 the science which is often complex and 10:47 ambiguous into language that our 10:49 patients or clients can understand to 10:52 make that knowledge and information 10:53 accessible so that they can make values 10:57 based decisions on information they 11:00 understand so an example would be that 11:03 in my current role I work in a private 11:07 practice setting where we have patients 11:09 who come in for scans during their 11:11 pregnancy if we see an abnormality on 11:13 that ultrasound I need to speak to that 11:16 couple about that abnormality and what 11:18 it's likely chromosomal or genetic basis 11:20 is we then organize the relevant testing 11:23 and depending on what the test reveals 11:26 we support that couple through their 11:29 decision process in terms of whether 11:31 they want to continue that pregnancy so 11:32 it's quite a journey then we walk 11:34 alongside our patients in that journey 11:37 and it's extremely rewarding to see 11:40 people work through to reach a decision 11:43 that works best for them I think 11:49 everybody knows what pharmacists do but 11:52 in my career I've probably worked in 11:55 about ten different settings so I 11:57 started off as a hospital intern 12:00 pharmacist and then I worked as a 12:03 military pharmacist for five years I 12:05 then worked in the UK as a medication 12:09 review pharmacist I came back to 12:11 Australia and purchased a community 12:13 pharmacy and worked as a community 12:15 pharmacy owner and then I developed a 12:19 specialty practice in medication review 12:21 so going into little old ladies houses 12:23 and helping them with their tablets and 12:25 helping their doctors understand the 12:27 best medications for them to be on and 12:29 recently I've been working with 12:31 pharmacists who are integrated in 12:33 general practice so when you're going to 12:35 see the GP there's not just a nurse or a 12:37 physio there's also a pharmacist there 12:39 so I think there are a few areas I 12:43 haven't worked in so there's obviously 12:44 Industrial pharmacy as well you could 12:46 work for a pharmaceutical company a lot 12:48 of our graduates do that but I'd say 12:51 it's a it's a really good career I 12:52 recommend it it's a clinical 12:56 psychologist what we work with is the 12:59 treatment of mental disorders so we work 13:02 with clients and assess their concerns 13:05 we might make a diagnosis if that's 13:07 warranted 13:08 we formulate their concerns so we find 13:11 out what what are the factors that are 13:12 maintaining their symptoms and then we 13:14 provide psychological treatment and that 13:17 can range in in lots of ways okay it's 13:21 evidence-based treatment it can range 13:23 from very short-term skills focused 13:26 treatments like cognitive behavior 13:28 therapy to longer-term treatment options 13:31 that can last for over a year or so 13:33 things like schema therapy and 13:34 psychodynamic therapy and clinical 13:37 psychologists work in a range of 13:39 different areas it's very diverse so you 13:41 can work in private practice community 13:44 public health settings hospitals private 13:47 and public hospitals not non-government 13:51 organizations consultancy universities 13:53 research there's lots of different 13:56 possibilities so for me personally 13:58 working in private practice I'm sort of 14:01 seeing you know anyone really who comes 14:03 in who wants to see a psychologist and 14:05 we can work with people who across the 14:07 lifespan who have you know clinical 14:09 disorder like anxiety or depression or 14:11 who are sort of on in the normal healthy 14:14 range and just learning some emotional 14:16 support with something or wanting to 14:18 talk about anything so it's very diverse 14:23 so most people when they think of physio 14:26 you think of the classic sports physio 14:28 but that's actually the one area that 14:29 I've never worked in I've dabbled in 14:31 every other area which I started out in 14:33 acute care in the hospitals so people 14:36 who are post-surgery we have a lot of 14:39 work to do with people who are posted 14:40 orthopedic or post cardiac surgery 14:42 getting them back on their feet again I 14:45 then moved to a rehabilitation clinic 14:47 for people post big injuries or 14:51 illnesses so people who've had a stroke 14:52 or a car accident or perhaps of you know 14:56 become really deconditioned and they 14:57 need help getting home and then did some 14:59 work in dementia care for a couple of 15:02 months which was really interesting 15:03 because a lot of those patients have a 15:06 lot of fear around movement and they 15:07 tend to decline in their mobility so our 15:09 role in that space is to keep them 15:11 active and it's actually one of the most 15:13 rewarding areas to work in even though 15:15 it's quite difficult and it's 15:17 someplace that people usually think that 15:19 physios would work in but we can have 15:21 quite a big difference in that area I 15:24 then went to acute neurosurgery so 15:26 people who've had spinal surgeries and 15:28 are requiring help to start moving after 15:30 they've had their spine fused or cut up 15:33 a little bit which was very interesting 15:34 and then I currently work with the NDIS 15:37 so I service the community for people 15:40 who have a really wide range of 15:43 intellectual and physical and 15:45 neurological disabilities so I work with 15:47 people who have things like Parkinson's 15:49 and multiple sclerosis I also work with 15:52 people who have autism and Asperger's 15:54 who have movement difficulties or 15:56 difficulties accessing exercise and 16:00 other clients with other forms of 16:01 intellectual disability with the aim of 16:03 keeping them active and functional for 16:04 as long as possible so I've made 16:08 probably main message would be the 16:09 sports physio is definitely an aspect of 16:11 it but there's this whole other gamut of 16:13 possibilities with the profession that's 16:15 great thank you I'm gonna ask the panel 16:17 another set of questions before I do is 16:19 it has anybody got a burning question 16:20 they just want to get out there now 16:21 we're happy to keep listening okay great 16:25 so Chris I'm gonna put you now is about 16:28 when you think of how your everyday work 16:29 what are two of the skills or abilities 16:31 that you think it absolutely keys you 16:34 being successful in your profession I 16:37 think communication will always be 16:39 number one for speech pathology but 16:42 absolutely being an empathetic person 16:44 being able to understand somebody's 16:47 situation and being able to look at that 16:51 objectively and to utilize all the 16:53 clinical knowledge that you've learned 16:55 and apply that and I think when you're 16:57 dealing with complex families and people 16:58 with complex histories and complex lives 17:02 that's really important to be an 17:04 empathetic person via Rachel I think 17:08 just being really dynamic with eye and 17:11 vision problems they very rarely come 17:15 isolated and if someone is losing vision 17:18 or is 17:20 here'd they're not going to just have 17:22 the eye disease that they've got they're 17:24 going to have mobility issues lifestyle 17:27 issues where you might also need to do 17:30 low vision therapy with those people 17:32 while they're also receiving treatment 17:34 so that's really important and obviously 17:36 you know we always work as part of a 17:38 team so communications got to be up 17:40 there as well yeah I second the 17:45 empathetic nature not many people see a 17:48 genetic counselor because they 17:49 particularly want to it's generally 17:51 because something pretty Awful's 17:52 happened to make them sit in front of 17:54 you for example a family member might 17:55 have passed away and then the rest of 17:58 the family wants to understand the 17:59 implications of the risk to them and 18:01 their children so empathetic empathy 18:04 always and then the other aspect is with 18:09 genetic counseling it's really cutting 18:10 edge the science is out of date in six 18:12 months at the moment so the science is 18:14 moving so incredibly fast in genetics 18:17 that to stay up to date means really 18:20 being on top of things and not just 18:22 going to work and leaving you need to 18:23 read you need to understand and you need 18:25 to ask questions so I think that genuine 18:28 enthusiasm any interest in the science 18:30 is really helpful so I've forgotten what 18:35 the question was - the key skills and 18:38 abilities I think make a good pharmacist 18:41 so I think really people skills is the 18:44 number one being able to understand the 18:49 level of understanding somebody comes in 18:51 with because when we're talking to 18:52 people about their medications we can do 18:55 it on a range of different levels and 18:57 the main thing is making sure that your 18:59 communication is heard and understood so 19:01 that the person goes away after a 19:03 conversation with you with more skills 19:06 than they came to the conversation with 19:08 and I think also being open to anything 19:10 so on I still work in community pharmacy 19:13 every second Sunday and sometimes I'll 19:16 be removing ticks from people's backs 19:19 sometimes I'll be giving them flu 19:21 vaccinations and sometimes I'll be 19:24 explaining to them 19:26 how to take their blood pressure 19:28 medication so I think it's it's just 19:31 being open to whatever comes in the door 19:34 is is always a good thing I would 19:38 probably say the ability to be 19:40 self-reflective and look inwards because 19:43 as a clinical psychologist you're 19:46 dealing with emotional topics and 19:49 clients who have a variety of 19:51 personalities and life experiences that 19:54 might be very different to your own so 19:55 that might trigger some things in 19:59 yourself and you have to be able to be 20:02 aware of that and how that's influencing 20:03 your work and work through that and I'd 20:06 also say just being approachable so you 20:08 can have all the technical knowledge you 20:11 know that's possible but you have to be 20:13 able to make people feel open you know 20:15 comfortable enough to share their 20:17 vulnerabilities with you after not 20:20 knowing you for very long so you're just 20:21 being very warm and approachable and 20:23 sort of non-judgmental and all of those 20:26 type of qualities as well and I would 20:29 second to Adele because as physios 20:32 particularly in the hospital or the 20:33 disability sector we're dealing with 20:34 very vulnerable people who are quite 20:37 slow to trust for very good reason and 20:39 so you need to have excellent people 20:40 skills to gain that therapeutic 20:42 relationship because then you'll get the 20:43 best outcome so it's the whole gamut of 20:45 people skills that come along with that 20:47 but I also think you need to be really 20:49 flexible to be a good physio because 20:51 you're dealing with a human being at the 20:53 end of the day and you can have all the 20:54 theory in the world and it just won't 20:56 apply to that person so you need to be 20:58 able to change it up and think on your 20:59 feet 21:00 so it would be my - great thank you I 21:02 think probably all of your your things 21:04 you've identified - probably shared 21:05 across your each of it really yeah just 21:07 that I'm not gonna ask a question this 21:09 is my future focus so you often hear and 21:11 I suppose you hear as well is that you 21:13 know that the job we have today is going 21:15 to look entirely different in five years 21:16 time and I think that's one of the 21:17 challenges that we're aware of 21:18 here at the Graduate School of Health 21:20 how do we prepare you not only for when 21:22 you graduate and become a health 21:23 professional but how do we also prepare 21:25 you with the skills that you'll need in 21:26 five or 10 years time when you're having 21:28 to adapt to somewhere work 21:30 is entirely different from the one we 21:32 have now and I certainly again reflected 21:34 on that one I think about when I first 21:35 started nursing and I it was some time 21:37 ago but when I think about that now and 21:39 I actually did my nursing back at UM in 21:42 a rural hospital what about hospital and 21:44 I think about that possible laughter 21:45 when I got home and I looked at and I 21:47 remember my days there being a student 21:49 nurse and I reflect now how different it 21:51 is in hospital I go in a visa people and 21:53 when I was practicing as a midwife 21:55 things have changed so rapidly and how 21:57 do the skill you have to have as a 21:58 health professional and really that was 22:00 identified by me as well he's about the 22:02 reading and staying on top of it but 22:03 there's more to it than that so I'm 22:05 gonna ask each of you when you think 22:07 about your profession now and in five 22:08 maybe ten years time what do you think 22:10 the key things are gonna happen whatever 22:12 the big picture things that are going to 22:14 happen within your area and I'll go the 22:16 other way just to give you a bit of 22:17 change around so Georgia so I'm biased 22:20 to a neuro perspective and in terms of 22:22 the treatment that we currently have for 22:23 stroke which is my specialty 22:25 it's just advancing at a really rapid 22:27 rate so they've got this really cool 22:29 tech at the moment where they can put a 22:30 tiny wire into the brain grab the clot 22:32 and take it out and the person is so 22:34 much better on the end of it which means 22:35 that we're dealing with a completely 22:37 different patient when we go to 22:38 rehabilitate them and we're having to 22:40 expand our concept of rehabilitation so 22:42 I think that's really exciting for the 22:44 next five to ten years because the whole 22:45 paradigm is going to change in how we 22:47 think about stroke rehab but in terms of 22:50 a more general sense the aging 22:52 population in Australia is going to need 22:54 to stay mobile for as long as possible 22:56 and I think we're going to play a huge 22:58 role in that and it like some people 23:00 think our H Care that's boring but from 23:02 personal experience is one of the most 23:04 rewarding and fun jobs to have because 23:06 the possibilities are endless and these 23:08 people are just so grateful to have your 23:09 help with doing things they want to keep 23:11 doing so I think that's a big role that 23:13 we're going to play in the next five to 23:14 ten years as well I would say definitely 23:18 in psychology because of a range of 23:22 factors probably mostly technology is 23:24 that we're moving to more of a stepped 23:26 care model so clients with sort of more 23:29 general 23:30 concerns can be serviced through 23:34 you know apps and online therapies and 23:37 then the more complex presentations are 23:39 coming to the clinicians so that's 23:42 really exciting 23:43 particularly for therapy because 23:46 clinical psychologists would be the 23:50 professionals who are seeing those are 23:52 more of the complex and a presentation 23:55 so we're getting to sort of use our 23:57 skills you know the way that they were 23:59 designed to rather than sort of just 24:01 seeing more of the general kind of 24:02 everyday presentations and I'd also say 24:05 there's a lot of changes at the moment 24:08 going on with the way Medicare is 24:10 structured and and the training pathways 24:14 for psychologists so there if anyone is 24:17 interested in psychology there used to 24:19 be sort of a ability to go through as a 24:21 general psychologist and they're now 24:23 removing that one of those the four plus 24:26 two pathways so it's becoming and also 24:29 with the changes to medicare rebates 24:30 it's becoming increasingly important to 24:32 have the clinical specialty so if you do 24:35 have the opportunity to do that I think 24:36 that would be very important for the 24:38 future in this field so for pharmacy I 24:42 think there's been a big increase in 24:45 interesting quality use of medicines and 24:48 reducing medication misadventure 24:50 so pharmacists are being seen as key 24:55 players in team-based care a lot more 24:57 and I think having pharmacist says 25:00 medication experts is really the way the 25:04 profession is going in the future has 25:08 anyone seen the movie Gattaca or am I 25:09 too old for this audience yeah so I 25:12 think we're kind of heading there but I 25:15 want to take the negative away from that 25:17 and say that we're hopefully heading 25:18 into a more if you want to do genetic 25:21 counseling watch Gattaca because it's 25:22 almost compulsory but we're heading 25:26 towards the preventative model where 25:27 we're moving away from waiting until 25:30 something devastating happens 25:32 genetically and then assessing the 25:33 family - hopefully identifying the 25:36 incident 25:36 advance to avoid the devastation that 25:39 can surround that event so the good 25:41 thing about genetics and the optimistic 25:43 thing about genetics is if we know 25:44 there's a risk we can sometimes mitigate 25:47 the risk through management strategies 25:49 for example the best example is in 25:51 cancer where we if we identify a faulty 25:54 cancer gene in a person we can improve 25:58 improve the prognosis for their family 26:01 because we know what risks need to be 26:02 managed I've just gotten back actually 26:07 from Taiwan where they're launching a 26:10 trial into a new medication to prevent 26:13 macular degeneration and those sort of 26:17 clinical trials and developments in 26:20 medical therapy are just always coming 26:24 out I've got another staff member going 26:26 to Chicago next week so it's just 26:28 constantly moving forward I mean that's 26:31 in terms of AMD which is a huge burden 26:33 on the Australian society and aging 26:35 population but you know if you were to 26:37 go get laser eye surgery today we would 26:39 recommend a different procedure that you 26:41 would have gotten two years ago and the 26:44 advances in cataract surgery and lenses 26:46 and wear 26:47 the great thing about being a North 26:48 Optus is where the people that do all 26:50 the diagnostics and all the imaging and 26:54 all the assessment of these diseases and 26:59 these processes so we're really in the 27:01 thick of the progress that's happening 27:06 in the industry so yeah I think that 27:08 there'll be completely different 27:10 treatments in a few years time there's 27:15 probably a few drivers have changed so 27:17 technology being one so things like 27:19 using telehealth we're less focused on 27:22 our own neighborhood and looking more at 27:24 providing rural services global services 27:27 using robotics for children with autism 27:30 or augmented reality so some of that 27:33 technology is driving areas of change 27:36 with the changes to the NDIS which is 27:40 funding a lot of how our services are 27:42 provided we're moving more to functional 27:46 type services where we're out in the 27:48 community 27:48 with clients less of that traditional 27:51 sitting at the table with picture cards 27:53 doing therapy so while we still do a lot 27:56 of that early intervention work the the 27:59 way we practice is changing and some of 28:01 that that is driven by the funding 28:03 bodies where we you know we're sourcing 28:06 our funds from I guess the other there's 28:09 are quite a few other areas that are 28:11 emerging in practice so working speech 28:13 pathologists working as intermediaries 28:15 in the court system working in juvenile 28:18 justice and adult justice settings 28:20 because there's a huge proportion at 28:22 least 50% who have a communication 28:24 impairment so there are quite a number 28:28 of areas that are emerging for practice 28:30 and probably by that you know by the 28:32 time you finish your master's degree if 28:35 it's in speech pathology that haven't 28:36 even been identified yet so I think some 28:39 of the government changes are also 28:41 leading to new opportunities for ways to 28:44 work as a speech pathologist you know if 28:50 you've got any questions you want to put 28:51 to any of the clinicians you can put a 28:53 general question or can choose your 28:54 discipline of choice yes that's right 28:58 this is a microphone for you sorry thank 29:00 you 29:01 hello so how does NDIS change the is it 29:05 to change the field is it because 29:06 there's more access well I think it's 29:08 given access so looking at the the 29:11 clients who were able to access those 29:13 services so say for example adults with 29:15 disabilities previously were funded by 29:18 government services I guess there's a 29:21 whole group of people who weren't really 29:23 receiving lots of services we now have 29:25 choice and control as to how their 29:27 services are provided so those clients 29:31 previously would have been serviced by a 29:32 government organisation now they're 29:34 coming into the private sector and they 29:35 have direct control over to how their 29:38 services are delivered and you know 29:40 we're looking at more functional so you 29:42 know going with clients into the 29:44 community to provide their services 29:45 rather than working in a purely clinical 29:47 setting so you know looking at more 29:49 functional therapy I would say physio 29:52 echoes that sentiment that you know 29:54 we've got this whole population of 29:55 people that we 29:56 really didn't have access to you because 29:57 the government services were a little 29:59 bit limited for us particularly when 30:00 discharging from hospital and now they 30:02 are in like exactly as he said in 30:04 control of the services that they want 30:06 and they know what their goals are and 30:08 you can work in any context to help them 30:10 achieve the goals so a client I had last 30:13 week he really wanted to be able to use 30:14 the gym and he was a bit scared about it 30:16 because he has a mental illness and he 30:18 was worried about the environment and 30:20 we're just I basically go to the gym 30:21 with him every Saturday and work on just 30:24 you know becoming familiar with basic 30:26 equipment and I would never have had 30:27 that opportunity I think before the NDIS 30:29 came into can I just add to that it's 30:32 really revolutionized orthotics from a 30:34 low vision perspective so one of the 30:36 largest employers of the thoughtlessness 30:37 Vision Australia and guide dogs as well 30:41 and they go out into the community and 30:44 provide that therapy and visual aids and 30:49 visual assistance to patients in their 30:51 homes and in their communities you know 30:53 helping them to work out which bus 30:54 they're trying to catch when they can't 30:56 see and that's been a major injection 30:59 for orthotics on that Street 31:12 what's the difference between clinical 31:14 psychology and other types of psychology 31:16 yep so there so there are so psychology 31:22 is very broad term so it's sort of 31:23 looking at generally the scientific 31:26 study of brain and behavior and clinical 31:29 psychology is the specialty of that 31:30 which looks at the treatment of mental 31:32 disorders there's also a general 31:35 psychologist who has done the undergrad 31:38 degree and then done an internship and 31:41 become just a general psychologist and 31:44 so the difference between what they 31:47 would do practically to a clinical 31:49 psychologist is a clinical psychologist 31:52 has is more specialized they've done an 31:55 additional post-grad training in 31:57 psychopathology and evidence-based 32:00 treatment so it's just it's it's in 32:04 practically it can it can sort of 32:08 overlap a little bit but it's becoming 32:11 more of a requirement in in most sort of 32:15 fields to have the additional specialty 32:18 now 32:27 I've got a question for Mia you said 32:32 that you followed the people that you 32:33 see through their journey while you're 32:35 helping them with their diagnosis I was 32:36 wondering what point you traveled with 32:39 them on that journey and if you pass 32:41 over to a another type of psychologist 32:43 or um I guess that's a cage of the role 32:45 is knowing what your limitations are as 32:47 a practitioner and knowing whether the 32:49 person needs more support than you're 32:50 able to provide so an example of a 32:52 typical journey that a patient will take 32:54 with me is that I'll see them at about 32:55 ten weeks time to do a newly available 33:00 DNA based test for chromosome 33:02 abnormalities I'll deliver that result 33:04 in about a week following that so I'll 33:06 call them and let them know if there's 33:07 an increased chance that their baby is 33:09 affected with a chromosomal disorder 33:12 I will then bring them in and have a 33:13 lengthy chat with the couple about what 33:15 that means for them and potentially the 33:18 child I'll also do some risk sort of 33:21 calculations in terms of what the 33:22 predictive value of the test is and the 33:24 likelihood that the baby just truly 33:25 affected so there is kind of a 33:26 scientific and mathematical component to 33:29 all of that and then I will follow that 33:31 patient up until about until they finish 33:34 their testing until about 16 or 17 weeks 33:36 down like pregnancy so it's sometimes 33:39 about a month of ongoing checking in 33:41 phone calls if I identify that that 33:43 person has a history of mental illness 33:45 or that I mean pregnancy can make 33:48 everyone a bit on edge but if somebody 33:50 hasn't identified our risk factor or I 33:52 can see that they're not coping I will 33:55 then refer on to a psychologist in that 33:59 scenario otherwise if I feel that you 34:02 know we have some question is that we 34:03 can use to assess assess that but 34:06 otherwise I will be in contact with them 34:07 and often I'll be in contact with them 34:10 potentially for many years to come as 34:13 they come back with future pregnancies 34:14 so they bring the child in and we so we 34:17 have a really nice relationship at six 34:20 and that's what makes the job extremely 34:21 rewarding 34:27 yes really when I talk about genetics 34:34 counseling a lot of people don't know 34:35 what there's no explain so how do you 34:37 get referred by to like how do you get 34:41 referred by patients you know so their 34:43 referral pathway for me as a genetic 34:45 counselor it's an emerging profession 34:47 it's very new I didn't know what it was 34:49 myself until I read a newspaper article 34:50 about this fabulous new profession in 34:52 The Sydney Morning Herald one Sunday and 34:54 I read and I said that's exactly what I 34:56 want to do with my lives so it's very 34:58 new it's very exciting but explaining 35:01 its people's a nightmare I spend half 35:02 the time at social functions with my 35:04 family explaining what I do and no one 35:06 no one understands it still so what I do 35:10 say is that we get referrals from GPS 35:14 obstetricians and other health 35:16 professionals because for them genetics 35:18 is not a comfort for many of them 35:20 they're not comfortable with it so we're 35:22 very specialized in a very small area of 35:26 medicine and health and we get referrals 35:29 from other health practitioners to 35:31 organize that facet of the patient 35:34 journey and it's becoming genetic 35:37 counseling is becoming very heavily 35:38 embedded in medicine now so particularly 35:41 in oncology in obstetrics of prenatal 35:44 pediatrics we're kind of everywhere so 35:47 we're sort of forcing our way in and 35:49 people are starting to learn who we are 35:51 so I explained it as the science meets 35:55 the human side because you get to do for 35:58 me it's just the dream job because it's 35:59 the best of both worlds 36:04 there's a question at the top of the 36:06 list and because because mirrors I'll 36:09 think about and because it's a vu video 36:13 is that a week okay yeah I can go with 36:15 that 36:15 um okay again absolutely I work very 36:18 yeah I work very closely with clinical 36:20 geneticists um clinical geneticists are 36:23 doctors who've gone and done a medical 36:25 degree and have gone on and done a 36:29 specialization as a geneticist so they 36:32 will take you know the full extent of a 36:35 medical degree and done it and then 36:36 they've done a specialization in 36:38 genetics and then they'll usually 36:39 specialize in a field of genetics so 36:43 I'll work alongside geneticists but in 36:48 my current role I don't work on a daily 36:50 basis with a geneticist I handle what I 36:53 can handle as a genetic counselor and 36:55 when it gets to something that's very 36:58 requires a specialist in that particular 37:01 area like maybe neurology or something 37:05 like that then it will go we will refer 37:08 on to a clinical geneticist and there 37:12 was a question here's the job prospects 37:15 I think that's a really good one in 37:16 terms of you know what the future's 37:17 looking like for you and you can hear 37:19 from what the panel have already said 37:20 about the range of opportunities there 37:22 are within each of those professions but 37:24 I'm going to put the question to each of 37:25 them and just just a vacant you could 37:28 tell us please what do you think the job 37:29 prospects are for your career do you 37:32 have a sense that there are jobs out 37:33 there that it's changing that 37:35 availability would be well I think with 37:38 the NDIS there's been a huge kind of in 37:42 flux in terms of speech pathologists 37:46 looking for work and I'd say usually 37:48 every day at least five new positions 37:50 advertised online and I think that we've 37:53 probably have a bit of a skills shortage 37:55 so in depending on where you want to 37:59 work there's probably more limited jobs 38:01 in terms of working in the hospital 38:03 settings so if you wanted to work in 38:05 acute care with adults there probably 38:08 are more limited roles but in terms of 38:10 working in pediatrics or in the area of 38:13 disability 38:13 there's a huge range of choices and and 38:16 probably if you're willing to look at 38:18 rural positions then there's a lot more 38:21 range of options in the rural setting 38:26 well orthotics definitely has a skill 38:28 shortage there's heaps of jobs really 38:33 all over Australia those who want to get 38:36 a job in Sydney usually have jobs 38:38 lightened up before they even graduate 38:40 but also Australia is a main orthotics 38:45 teaching hub for the whole asia-pacific 38:48 region so I've got a number of friends 38:50 who are working in Malaysia Indonesia 38:53 I've got one friend who went over to 38:56 Sweden for a while so we definitely kind 39:00 of export our orthotics skills if you're 39:02 interested in doing some work overseas 39:06 yeah you shouldn't have no problems 39:08 getting a job in Australia the job 39:13 prospects are excellent there's a 39:16 shortage of genetic counselors I my last 39:19 jobs in genetic counseling have not been 39:21 advertised I've been approached there's 39:24 there's jobs that are advertised that 39:26 get no applicants at the moment so 39:28 that's the level of the whoops the 39:30 shortage that we're talking about 39:32 it's an international issue so I've been 39:36 approached for jobs in Singapore and 39:38 various other countries because they are 39:40 similarly short of genetic counselors so 39:44 excellent okay 39:47 Pharmacy I think it really depends where 39:50 you want to work so if you want to work 39:52 in industry or in hospital it's harder 39:55 to get those jobs but our graduates have 39:57 been really successful in getting those 39:59 positions if you want to work in 40:01 community pharmacy 40:02 it's know that they're everywhere 40:05 everyone I'm sure you know in most towns 40:07 is two or three community pharmacies so 40:10 I think there's 24,000 pharmacists 40:13 working in community pharmacy across 40:16 this Australia so if you want to work in 40:18 I work on Sundays five minutes from my 40:21 house and I do home medicines reviews 40:23 for people who live in the same street 40:25 as me 40:26 it is definitely a job where if you want 40:28 to work close to home you can and if you 40:31 want to travel anywhere in the country 40:32 you can get a job yes also very good for 40:37 clinical psychology so yeah that there's 40:43 you have the opportunity in there's a 40:46 range of different like we've said you 40:47 can work in a range of different roles 40:49 and also I've got friends who have 40:53 started to work for themselves only a 40:55 few years after graduating from the 40:57 program and start their own businesses 40:59 so there's that option as well there's a 41:00 lot of variety and flexibility to make 41:03 your own hours and as there's more 41:06 awareness about mental health and 41:08 there's reduce stigma more people are 41:09 open to seeing a clinical psychologist 41:12 so the there are much more job prospects 41:15 than previously I would say that physio 41:19 mimics the speech side of things in that 41:21 the hospital jobs are harder to come by 41:23 but that being said we've moved to a 41:25 merit-based system of new grad positions 41:27 so if you do well enough in your 41:29 university course and you interview well 41:31 then you will get a new graduate 41:33 position out of a major metro sydney 41:35 hospital then once you've got the foot 41:37 in the door in that manner it's been 41:38 easier to climb the hospital that up but 41:41 in every other aspect physio is 41:43 expanding rapidly and particularly as we 41:45 have already said with the NDIS and 41:46 other funding opportunities and there's 41:49 just such a broad range of areas in 41:51 which you can work from working to 41:53 someone from someone else to opening 41:54 your own practice to working overseas so 41:56 yeah I would say physio is also 41:58 excellent for jobs and many 42:01 opportunities to actually open your own 42:02 practices you're just saying Georgia so 42:04 I think each of you could do something 42:06 where you could actually sort of run 42:07 your own business in many ways yeah okay 42:10 thank you any more questions from the 42:13 floor before I've got one more question 42:14 I think it'd be great I'd down the bad 42:15 gifts thank you just microphone thank 42:18 you hey um this is for Adelle so with 42:22 with the Medicare like restructure and 42:25 getting rid of the four plus two pathway 42:27 is there anything that education 42:30 providers will do to kind of compensate 42:32 for that lack of 42:34 training and specialized training what 42:38 do you mean so by education providers 42:39 like UTSA and master's programs so 42:43 because if the if the if Medicare is 42:47 gonna be restructured then general 42:48 psychologists will be redundant in the 42:51 future so I don't think they'll be 42:53 redundant I think that they're just 42:55 slowly changing the training pathways to 42:59 encourage more people to do the the 43:00 post-grad qualification so there are a 43:03 lot more post-grad spots than there used 43:06 to be and a lot more programs like UTS 43:08 now offering clinical psychology and 43:11 yeah so it's just becoming becoming more 43:15 in line with what it is internationally 43:16 that you need that postgraduate 43:18 qualification thank you other questions 43:26 one more just to finish up I think on a 43:28 and a positive note even though it's a 43:30 difficult question but you know 43:32 obviously the work you do is with people 43:33 and so part of that of course is 43:35 managing as you say being empathetic 43:36 communicating well but there are 43:38 emotional impacts of the work you do so 43:40 can you please tell us again we'll start 43:42 without George Stanley into what's you 43:44 know one way that you might do with some 43:46 of the emotional impacts of the work 43:47 that you want to take it was hard to 43:51 learn because it was a big shock when I 43:52 first started working it took me about 43:54 six months to settle in but just having 43:56 friends who are in the same field as you 43:59 particularly if you are working in a 44:01 hospital because the things that you see 44:02 in a hospital of you know people that 44:04 the worst end of sicknesses and someone 44:06 who understands exactly what you've seen 44:08 at work today is really helpful to have 44:10 and being able to talk through that of 44:12 an evening yeah I would really recommend 44:15 you make sure you've got that structure 44:16 around you if you're gonna go into that 44:18 line of work I would say having very 44:22 good support around you particularly a 44:24 lot of the majority of our cohort went 44:28 into private practice and that's 44:29 notoriously not as good for support as 44:32 some of the other sort of public 44:35 settings so I got a peer supervision 44:39 group with some of 44:40 my colleagues set up and that's been 44:43 invaluable being able to talk about 44:45 cases and just vent and share your 44:48 experiences and have that commonality 44:50 you know that you're not alone because 44:51 when you first graduate you doubt 44:53 yourself so much and you think you know 44:55 you think you're really incompetent and 44:57 and everything's a challenge so it's 45:00 really helpful to have a peer 45:01 supervision group having really good 45:04 boundaries as well and not working not 45:05 taking on too much and having very good 45:08 self-care and just knowing what the 45:10 early warning signs are that you might 45:12 be a little bit burnt out or you might 45:13 have a bit of vicarious trauma and 45:15 getting support for that yourself as 45:17 well I think as a pharmacist you're very 45:22 rarely working alone when I do 45:25 medication review I I do go out to 45:28 patients homes by myself but you're 45:30 usually part of a team and I think 45:32 that's definitely in community pharmacy 45:36 we quite often have a chuckle after 45:38 people leave but obviously not well 45:41 anyone else is in the shop it is it's it 45:45 is interesting to see what walks in the 45:47 door sometimes and I think you do get 45:49 really to see the full gamut of life and 45:53 people's experiences and it is it's very 45:56 it's very eye-opening when you're a 45:58 junior pharmacist and you're you're 46:00 getting but now I don't think there's 46:02 too much that could faze me I think I've 46:04 been held up at least four times I've 46:08 been you know I've managed to perform 46:13 CPR I've had someone have a heart attack 46:16 in the pharmacy I've had amazing things 46:20 happen so I think over 20 years you kind 46:22 of get all these experiences and then 46:24 there's not much that can faze me these 46:26 days usually it's its water off a duck's 46:29 back yes difficult at times to disengage 46:36 but I'd second are what Adele said about 46:39 self-care and talking with colleagues 46:42 and we as genetic counselors have our 46:45 supervision meetings with people so that 46:47 we can discuss what's what's going on so 46:51 you don't feel like you're alone and 46:54 we reflect a lot on how we've done 46:56 things and and not just to beat up on 46:58 ourselves but just for for learning ah 47:00 future our reference and to learn how to 47:04 do things better yeah thank you yeah I 47:07 think it is difficult and often often 47:12 because we are very much involved in 47:14 Diagnostics and very we very involved 47:17 with children we do we are often the 47:20 first people to pick some of the these 47:22 stuff up and I think the best thing is 47:27 just working as a team and having not 47:30 working in isolation journeying with the 47:33 patient as they go through the process 47:35 and you present them with the news and 47:38 following up on that patient and just 47:40 making sure you've got a healthy work 47:43 pace with good colleagues by your side 47:45 and you know I think following the 47:48 patient through also it makes a big 47:49 difference and just journeying with them 47:51 and seeing the progress we're very lucky 47:54 in ophthalmology that the vast majority 47:56 of our treatments are very effective I 47:59 think it's okay to be emotionally 48:02 invested in your clients because that's 48:04 really what drives you to want better 48:06 outcomes it's not you know there's not a 48:08 lecturer there that's checking your 48:10 academic performance but having you know 48:13 when you're really emotionally invested 48:15 in your clients you're driven to find 48:18 out what the new research is look for 48:19 better outcomes and it's okay to be 48:21 human I think that's what makes you a 48:23 good health professional that you relate 48:25 to somebody and you can see them where 48:29 they are at any given time when they 48:30 come in we do spend a lot of time doing 48:32 social stuff in our clinic as well as 48:35 having clinical case conferencing 48:37 sometimes we'll have social events where 48:39 staff have a chance to talk to each 48:41 other and support each other outside the 48:44 clinical setting and I think it's okay 48:46 to recognize that everybody deals with 48:48 things in different ways so 48:50 understanding your reflective style 48:52 some people might need to talk about 48:54 something straight away other people 48:56 like to reflect on it for a little while 48:58 and I recognize that sometimes when I 49:01 carry everyone else's burden that I also 49:03 need to look after myself 49:05 so that you know I have a Venusian jizz 49:10 and having supports at many different 49:13 levels whether it's from academic input 49:15 or having some professional emotional 49:18 support I think that's really important 49:19 great thank you 49:20 key message isn't it it's about you know 49:22 communication as a health professional 49:23 but also ensuring that you can then 49:25 communicate with others afterwards and 49:27 to share your experiences and that's a 49:28 great some great lessons there thank you 49:31 so much Dracula's really appreciate you 49:33 coming along this evening wet and cold 49:34 and giving us your time it's been really 49:36 interesting to hear about what each of 49:38 you do and for you to share your 49:39 personal experiences with us so thank 49:41 you very much and thank you all for 49:43 coming along tonight I really appreciate 49:44 your attendance and best wishes “I get to interact with patients every day, we get to follow them up and see how they’re going. It’s good to be able to see them improving and following your advice. The parents are happy. The kids are happy and I’m happy. That’s probably my favourite thing.” Georgia Shaw In Australia, there are very few Bachelor’s degrees that provide in-depth education in ocular neuro-anatomy and physiology to a level at which UTS could consider them to be a pre-requisite for the Master of Orthoptics. Our intensive postgraduate course is designed for skilled learners, using scaffolded learning to reinforce theory that is directly applied in simulated clinical teaching and in clinical placements across a wide range of Orthoptic practice. Our Orthoptics graduates are highly regarded both nationally and internationally, working in the UK, USA, Europe and Asia as well as across Australia. Despite there having been Orthoptists in Australia since the 1950s, they were initially a very small and niche profession, and therefore are not as well known in the community as physiotherapists or other health professionals. As such, universities were hesitant to begin schools of Orthoptics as awareness of and demand for courses was relatively low. However, with the aging of the population and the rapid increase in Ophthalmic technology, Orthoptists have vastly expanded their expertise and are highly sought after in both Australia and internationally. The Orthoptic school moved to UTS in 2015 in response to the increased demand (amongst other reasons), to grow the size of our student cohort. Vision Science subjects are taught at an undergraduate level, while the subjects in the Master of Orthoptics are taught at postgraduate level. Orthoptics subjects therefore have higher intellectual and academic requirements. As such no undergraduate subject can be awarded credit towards a Master level course. Aida Zeric – “I am currently working full-time over two clinics: one clinic in the private sector, and one in the public/community health sector. Both clinics are predominantly paediatric, and what I like most about my job is the challenge that comes with assessing the vision and binocular function of children of a variety of ages. I also enjoy a seeing a child’s vision improve as they undergo treatment, and hearing all the cute and funny things they have to say throughout the consultation.” Genevieve Mooney – “I’m working in a variety of orthoptic disciplines including pediatrics, neuro, refractive and general ophthalmology. Every day is a little bit different and the patients definitely keep me on my toes.” Dantong Xie – ​“I am currently working as a full-time orthoptist at Lions Eye Institute in both the clinic and the clinical trials department. Working in both research and the clinic gives me a variety of duties, including seeing patients and trials admin work.” Prem Gunasekaran – “I currently work in clinical applications for a large optical company, ZEISS. My role involves presenting lectures, teaching clinical and medical staff how to use our technology, and most importantly, supporting clinics all across NSW and ACT in any way I can. The aspect I enjoy the most in my job is that every day is completely different and I get to meet many different people who share the same passion for eye health as I do.” Zoe Deuxberry - ""I am currently working full-time at The Singapore National Eye Centre as an Orthoptist. It’s the largest eye centre in Singapore where I get to work with a variety of different patients across pediatrics, strabismus and neuro-ophthalmology."" The Australian Government’s Department of Employment predicts a 3.26% expected growth in orthoptist jobs between May 2017 and May 2022. Due to the international aging population and the rapid increase in Ophthalmic technology, Orthoptists have vastly expanded their expertise and are highly sought after in both Australia and internationally. Over 13 million Australians had one or more chronic eye conditions in 2017-18, with 93% of people aged 65 and over being affected by long-term vision disorders. See more: https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/eye-health/eye-health/contents/how-common-is-visual-impairment Orthoptists can open their own private practices, however due to the nature of their work, it is recommended that they first build a network of potential referrers. The minimum annual salary for an orthoptist in Australia is $72,461, specified by the award as of July 2021. In private practices, most orthoptists negotiate a higher wage and there is scope for advanced career progression through leadership roles. Orthoptists are included in the NSW Health Award, putting them on the same award as an Audiologist, Counsellor, Dietitian, Exercise Physiologist, Genetic Counsellor, Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist, Podiatrist, Social Worker, Speech Pathologist or Welfare Officer.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/business-courses/undergraduate-programs/faq-videos-new-undergraduate-students,"Starting your bachelor degree with us soon? Award-winning Accounting academic, Dr Amanda White, and fourth-year Bachelor of Business/Bachelor of Arts in International Studies student and President of the UTS Business Society, Caster Calma, discuss the answers to our most frequently asked questions from commencing students in our Bachelor programs. This series of videos covers everything from whether you need a Mac or Windows computer, to how our exams work, how you go about getting a student card, and even the big issues like where the best coffee is on campus. - So we have two student centres located in Building 10 and Building Five, but you can find that all online if you literally just type in UTS Student Centre into Google, come up. You can email them, you can call them, or you can visit them in person. - Yep, and that's the place for everything to do with student admin. So subject enrollments, results-- - Changing majors. - Changing majors, changing degrees, all of that happens through the Student Centre. So there are two main sorts of fees that you'll end up paying at university. You'll pay your fees for the individual subjects-- - So your tuition fees, yeah. - Tuition, which, depending on whether you're a domestic student or an international student, there may or may not be loans available for those. So some students will be paying up front, and some people will be paying in a deferred manner. The other area where you have fees is a student services and facilities fee, which everybody has to pay at the start of semester. Casta, what is that fee for? - So, that fee is mainly to, I guess, fund all the extra services that UTS provides you. So a lot of students don't realise that we have legal services, we have a counsellor, we have a doctor. - We have lots of counsellors and psychologists, yep, lots of medical staff. - Yeah. Well, I think it's roughly 100 or so dollars. It depends on every semester. But that's what that fund contributes to. You can defer it, but most people just pay it off. - So it's a good thing to pay up front, because all of the things like cafes on campus, those medical services and student support, a lot of that gets funded through those programmes. There are other things where you may choose to pay a fee for. So if you decide to join the UTS Activate Gym, for example, or you join any of our clubs and societies, they'll all have small fees attached. But you don't have to join any of those, none of that's compulsory. That student services fee is the only one that you really need to make sure that you pay before you start university. When it comes to the cost of tuition, check out the UTS website for fees, because fees vary depending on the type of course and the subjects that you're studying. There are some subjects that are charged a higher tuition fee than others, so it's always best to check those out. And they change from year to year as well. Mac or Windows, ooh, that is such a good question. What do you use? - I personally use an Apple, a Mac, just because it's idiot-proof software. It's easy to use, and it's just simple, and I understand the keyboard shortcuts, which are very handy. - It doesn't really matter, I think. - Yeah, it doesn't matter. - I'm a Mac user as well, 'cause I have an iPhone, I have an iPad. What I see is really popular is the Microsoft Surface. - Yes, yeah. - And that's a really great tool. - I've also started to see a lot of iPad Pros, with the keyboard and pen. I've started to see those as well. - So whatever you've got, in terms of technology. UTS is not device specific. So you don't need to have a specific device. And if you don't have a device, make sure you talk to UTS Student Services, because there are ways that you can actually borrow a device for the entire semester. - And all of the software that UTS has is compatible on Windows and Mac. - Yes. - So, doesn't really matter. - And you'll never have to buy software to complete assessments, we'll always have it available on UTS computers, or the ability for you to download a student licence onto your application. - And then just log in with your student credentials. - Absolutely. If you're sick or something happens, I don't usually expect students to write to me if they're missing a lecture, especially if there's a recording. But it's always nice to give your tutor a heads up if you're going to be away, you know, beforehand, or if you know you're going to be sick. Just in case there's something that you miss. Sometimes it's good to talk to your academics about if there's any chance to catch up on work. Ooh, eating in class. I guess while I'm teaching, I'm not eating, 'cause I don't know if you'd really like the sound of me talking and eating at the same time. I don't mind if students eat. So, there are some rooms where it'll say no food or drink outside the door. But most of the time, I would expect that, as long as we're being mature about it, we're not leaving our rubbish behind, you can eat and drink in class, I don't have an issue. Unless it's something stinky! - Yes, yes. I definitely eat in class, because I always eat. But little things like chips or biscuits, that you can easily put in your mouth. Obviously I don't bring in a whole dish with rice or noodles , because I also have to be considerate of other people, and the smell. - Please, don't open a durian. - Yeah, and don't open tuna in the classroom as well. - No, no tuna-- - That is a big no. - No durian. - No durian or tuna. - Yeah. Most students will bring a coffee into the class, that's pretty common. - Yeah. - And yeah, we don't mind if you're, you know, if you're a few minutes late to the tut, or something else, or you have to leave a few minutes early because you've gone out to get food or whatever it might be, leaving the classroom is not an issue. This is not high school where you need to ask permission or anything like that. - It's the same thing with using the bathroom as well. If you need to go to the bathroom, you just go. The tutor doesn't-- - You don't have to get a pass. - Yeah, the tutor won't sign your diary, or anything like that, like high school. You can just walk up and leave. I call my academics, or the teachers, or the tutors, by their first names. - And that's normally what most people are happy with. - Yeah, it's actually kind of weird if you actually call them miss or sir, or Mrs. and their last name as you would in high school, because no one does that. - No, don't do that. - So please call them by their first names. 'Cause I have been in some third year classes with first years, and they actually say Miss or Mrs., and it's really awkward, 'cause I'm like-- - Yeah, I don't like it when people call me Dr. White, it's just a bit weird, so. If somebody does want you to call them by their title, so Dr., Assistant Professor, Professor, then they will say that. But otherwise, you can assume we're average, normal, everyday people, just like you. And calling us by our first names is fine. So not very many students actually drive to university. Because we're in such a centralised location, most people catch public transport. If you can afford to drive, then expect to pay a lot for parking. We do have some student parking facilities at different parking lots around, but it is essentially like a retail rate for the day. So it's anywhere between 17 and 20 dollars a day for parking, and you're not guaranteed of a spot either. If you want to drive and you want a definite spot, then looking on places like Gumtree is useful to maybe hire or lease a spot off somebody in a nearby apartment building. But otherwise, I really wouldn't recommend driving. And traffic around UTS, at peak hour-- - With the small lanes and everything. - Small lanes, one way, it's just really really busy. As a staff member, I catch public transport. And I would only drive if I absolutely needed to. Even when I'm here late at night, so I have classes that run 'til 9:00. Sometimes we have events at university that run 'til late. If I have driven and I don't feel safe walking to my car, I can actually call UTS security, and someone can come and escort me from wherever I am on campus to wherever I've parked my vehicle, within a reasonable distance. UTS actually now is really a sticky campus. So once we hit 9:00, which is when classes officially end, you'll still see, when semester's on, people everywhere. So, it's pretty safe to walk to Central Station or to the bus stops at 9:00 at night. Once it gets quite late, access to university is via your staff card. So you'll need that to swipe in and out to make sure that there's not just randoms walking around uni. You know, if you do get tired and you need a nap during the day, the library has sleep pods. - The library, yeah. - And we're here in Building Two, and we've seen people just sort of lay down on a bench napping. Always lie on your bag. So put your valuables in your bag, and then lie on top of it. - Or if you wanna nap, maybe be with your group of friends. Because obviously they'll make sure that none of your belongings are stolen. Unless-- - Hopefully. - They're the ones that are stealing your belongings. But if you really are scared about getting your stuff stolen, try and be with a group of your friends, so you can sleep then. - Absolutely, absolutely. If you feel like you're unwell, as well, on campus, just head straight to Building One, on Level Six. There's the medical facility there. Usually it's by appointment. But if you're really just urgently unwell, they will see you, walk-in, straightaway. It's a little bit different from high school in that there's no bell. So there's not an hourly bell, or a bell between classes, because classes run anywhere from one hour, one and half hours, two hours, three hours, four hours. And they start and stop at all different times. So we're not all moving at the same time. What your subject teacher, whether that's the lecturer or the tutor, should do, is they should finish the class 10 minutes before it's official end time. So a one hour 30 minute class should actually go for one hour 20. And then they should wrap up. And then you've got between five to seven minutes to walk to your next room. And then it should start on time. Now, in terms of distance between campus, if you are up here in Building Two and then you have to go down all the way to a lecture theatre on another side, then obviously your lecturers and your tutors will take that into account. But don't dawdle. - Yeah. - So, you know, don't stop for, like, a kabob on the way. Or if you do, nominate one person to get the food and send everybody else on to class. Because quite often, it's your teachers also walking between those rooms. - Because UTS's buildings are all over the place, make sure you're wearing comfortable attire. - Yeah. - Don't wear heels, like-- - If you're good at walking in heels, then go for it. - Yeah, then go for it. But, you know, just wear your runners. People have literally turned up to class in their trackies in winter. - There's no dress code-- - Be comfortable. - For coming to uni. - There's no uniform. Just be comfortable. - It's not a fashion state. So there is a UTS fashion Instagram account that captures great fashion on campus. But it is really relaxed. Now, if you come straight from work and you're in a business suit and tie-- - That's fine. - Then that's fine. In summer, if it's really stinkin' hot, and you wanna wear t-shirts and shorts, that's fine. - And thongs, yeah, that's fine. - Now if you do ever lose anything on campus, a jumper, a laptop, a phone, obviously if you've got your name on something, that's good. But if you do lose something, staff are trained to hand everything that we find into UTS security. Now what security will do if stuff is left in classrooms is that they'll leave it there until the end of the day, so that you can go back to it. So if you think, oh crap, I've left my jumper behind, go back to the room that you lost it in. If it's not there, then check with the security office that's closest to you. The main security office is in Building One. There are probably 15 to 20,000 students on campus everyday here, so we have a lot of people on campus. And IT tells me that there are more than 40,000 devices connected to the Wi-Fi every day. So if you need to connect more than one device, I will have my phone, my tablet, and my laptop often all connected to the Wi-Fi. It's the same login that you use to access your student one stop admin, your UTS Online, your student email. I would recommend checking it at least once every couple of days. Don't leave it to once a week, because it's the official communication channel. Content includes: - Now, at university, you're adults. So, we don't keep track of attendance in lectures, sometimes we do in tutorials. We'd like you to come to everything. The lectures are where we give you, often, a broad overview and are really talking about key major concepts, and our tutorials are where you're going to try and apply those concepts in active learning situations. But there's lots of different forms of learning at UTS in lectures, in tutorials, and workshops. Caster, from a student's perspective, do you always turn up to class? - Yes, actually, I do. Occasionally, there are some times, like if I have a doctor's appointment, or I've got some work stuff, I just can't come to class 'cause I can't make it 'cause it overlaps, but for the most part, I always try to come to class with lectures, which is where you learn content. Some of my subjects are recorded so it's easy for me to just open my computer at night and actually watch lectures. Tutorials, which is more of a classroom setting where you don't necessarily learn content but the tutor or the teacher reinforces the knowledge, and I try to go to those because attendance, sometimes it's marked, sometimes it's not, just depends on the subject, but also things like homework might be due. Assessments, tests might be due. - Yeah, if you've got questions about assignments and stuff, - Yeah, questions. Yeah, questions as well. - that's always the place to go 'cause your tutor is probably more able to help you, and it's really important to remember that this is your opportunity for learning. You don't have to come to anything. You could really sit in the bar, or do anything else that you want. With lecture recordings, please make sure you check with your different subject coordinators because some rooms aren't recorded, and tutorials definitely don't have any recordings associated with them. In the lectures and the tutorials, Caster, how do you actually go about learning? What are the things you do? - So, in lectures, the subject coordinator or your teacher usually has a PowerPoint presentation, and they usually have a few dot points or paragraphs explaining the content and what the day's about, and personally, for me, I still type notes, just cause it's really fast, and sometimes it's hard to keep up in the classroom when your teacher is talking really fast and you're trying to understand the concepts and ideas, so I just type 'cause it's easy, and it's-- - Depends, I guess, whether you're faster at writing. - Yeah, exactly. - Or at typing. I'm a bit of a fast typer but slow writer. - Yeah, and in tutorials, I usually handwrite notes because it's more, I guess, a rough kind of learning experience because you're trying. The tutor will kind of take main points out the lectures so I kind of just, to break it up, mind maps, that's I was getting at. Mind maps and just rough notes where I can scribble and cross out stuff, so it's a bit more informal for me in a tutorial. - Cool. And one other thing is that as a UTS student, you'll get access to Office 365, and if you haven't tried it, check out OneNote. It's actually an ability for you to have online notes. You can handwrite, and you can type. You can import your lecture notes in there, and I find that to be a really cool little tool, and there's even a little app where when you take a photo of a PowerPoint slide side on, it'll actually straighten it for you and import it into the document. So there's lots of cool technology as well if you're a tech person, or if you're old school. I still handwrite sometimes. - Yeah, just to to add onto that, even if you miss an idea or miss a slide in your lecture, don't be too concerned because you actually get them before or after the lecture anyway, and you can have time in your own time to go over the notes. - Assessments is a question students always ask about, and assessments are really the key points in which we are checking, as academics, that you're learning the material. So there'll be assessments during the semester, and there'll usually be a larger assessment at the end of semester. What sort of assessments have you had throughout your uni career? - So, most of the time, during the semesters, sorry, during the weeks, the assessment could be like a group report or an individual essay. That's the main two months, and then the subject usually ends with a big final exam, which is, generally speaking, weighted more, and that's where you have to, in those kind of exams, really consolidate what you've learned and apply it to our cases or scenarios. - Yeah. And there's lots of different types of assessments. So Caster mentioned group assignments and reports. You might have quizzes that you do in class or online. There could be presentations. At UTS, we're really about trying to create real-world, authentic assessments, tasks that would be similar to what you would be doing in the workplace associated with that subject, so you get a real feel for what it's like. Learning is about putting in the right type of effort as well, so how we design our assessments at UTS is not usually around memorising. So I know that sometimes, high school exams are about remembering facts-- - And the syllabus. - And the syllabus. Really, here, we want you to demonstrate that you can apply what you know in real-life situations or similar to real-life situations. So memorising doesn't normally play a large part in passing our assessments and our tasks. It's being authentic and engaging with the material deeply that's going to help you get there. - Now, when it comes time to exams, you said that we have lots of exams that are high-stakes. So in a lot of cases, they're 40 or 50 or 60%. Where do you go to sit exams? Are they just in the class? - A majority of my exams are in a place called Mount Worth Park, which is a five-minute walk from the light rail stop. Most, I would assume, most of your exams would be there, 'cause it's such a large venue; however, the subjects that have smaller classes are usually just held on UTS campus. - Yeah, so your one-stop Student Admin will be your portal for everything administration. - And please make sure you check that as well because your seats change, your location change, and you don't want to rock up to the wrong venue-- - Yes. - Or wrong classroom and then be late for your-- - So some subjects, don't always rely on your friends, because sometimes, some really large subjects are actually split over two or three venues. You will get be given a specific seat number, and most of those exams, they'll be different formats as well. So some will be open-book, where you can take in everything. Some will be restricted open-book, where you might get one page double-sided. - One textbook, yeah. - Or one textbook. And then some will be closed-book where you don't-- - Where there's nothing at all. - Don't have anything, but your subject coordinator will give you all of that information within the subject outline and reinforce that. So it's really important that you understand these rules because if you bring material into a closed-book exam and you don't realise, or you get it out, and you think you're going to use it, then that's in breach of the university's rules, and the university will charge you with attempting to cheat within an exam. And that's a really serious thing. - And exam supervisors are actually quite strict because the final exams for your subjects are centrally conducted, which means your tutors or your subject coordinator, who, you're probably familiar with their face, they're not going to be there on the exam, so the exam supervisors are quite strict, and sometimes they actually do go through your textbook to see if you've written anything. They check your formula sheets, so make sure your-- - Or look inside pencil cases or on calculators. - So make sure you're just following the rules, and it'll be an easy-- - Follow the rules that your subject coordinator sets and you'll be absolutely fine with that. Now, what happens if you miss an exam? Because you might get sick. Do you know what to do? - I personally have never missed an exam, so I don't actually know what to do. - Well, I can tell you exactly what you need to do. If you are sick and you miss the exam, you need to apply for a missed exam. There's a special form through your online student portal. It'll give you a piece of paper to print out. You have to get that filled in by your doctor within 48 hours of the exam, so don't leave it too long. Now, if you think, ""Oh, I'm little bit sick, ""but I can still go to the exam,"" then still go, but you can apply for something called special consideration, which means that in the days leading up to the exam, you're affected by something. So at the moment, I've got a bit of a cold. If I was sitting an exam, I might lodge that application. Again, you have to get a doctor to fill it out or another medical professional. - And is that still within the 48 hours as well? - It's still within the 48 hours, as well as those guidelines, but that means that you're making your tutor or your lecturer aware that you've been unwell, especially for myself as an academic, if I see a student that performs really, really poorly in the final exam, even though I know that they've engaged really well in class, and they've done really well in the class assessments, unless I have something that says they were sick or something else happened, I wonder what happened to that student. Is there any way that we can help them? Because as an academic, I want the best out of all of my students, and I want to be able to help you no matter what the situation is. So if you are sick during semester, not just for exams or sick in the lead-up to an assessment, consider lodging an application for special consideration and talking to your subject coordinators, 'cause we're real people just like you are. One thing that always comes up is that in week 10 of session, when the exam timetable is released, inevitably, I will get students that come to me and say, ""Amanda, I've booked a holiday ""for when the exam is."" Do you think we can change your exam if you've booked a holiday? - No, they won't care. - No, we won't care. - They won't care. - Unless it's something really serious, if it's something that you can control, like booking a holiday, and we have a three-week exam period, if you book that in the last week, and you're gonna be away, that's tough luck. You need to shift your holiday. Always look on the university calendar for dates for things so that you know when you can book a holiday and when you can't because we will not shift exam dates for that sort of activity. Now, there are some circumstances where we will shift exams. So, if you need to have an operation for something, and you can't come to the exam, then we can arrange to have that at an early day. If you are working full-time and coming to university part-time, and your work requires you to be in another country, in another state, in another city, then definitely, you can lodge a request to change that, but for things like holidays or birthday celebrations overseas, that's not something that we make changes for. We also try and make sure that you don't get overloaded with exams, so there are processes in place to make sure that you don't have four exams on a day or more than three exams within a 24-hour period. We'll spread those out if that's the case. - But all of this information you can see well before your exams, so there is time to, I guess, approach your academic or subject coordinator if you have any problems, so make sure you give yourself enough time. - Week 10 is usually when it comes out, and you'll get all the details in your one-stop Student Admin, but you can look at the university calendar two years in advance, so there's no excuses for saying, ""I didn't know exams were on,"" because the university calendar is published two years in advance, so don't make that mistake. - When it comes to how much time you should spend on a subject, according to our calculations, we expect that for a single subject, including going to class, doing homework, doing assignments, studying for the final, it's somewhere between 120 to 140 hours for that subject over the 12 to 13 weeks of the period. When it comes to students, and for us, four subjects is like being in a full-time job. That's 40 hours a week, 40 to 45 hours a week. Caster, what's the reality? - The reality is, I know in my experience, is you really could not find that time to do all that study. It really just comes down to, I guess, what kind of mark you're aiming for, or, I guess, your level of interest in a particular subject. - Really, the more effort that you put in-- - Obviously, you're going to do well. - Yeah, that's going to pay off in terms of better grades, and be careful about thinking, ""I just want to do enough to pass,"" because I see a lot of students who think, ""I just want to do enough to pass,"" and then they end up just falling short and just failing. That's something to be really careful of. - And just on that, that's such a good point because particularly when you're doing a group assignment, for example, while you might just want to pass, maybe some other people in your group actually wanna get a High Distinction or Distinction, so you have to really come top-tip in a group report or group assignment. Actually have a grade in mind you want to get because that's gonna set the benchmark of-- - And communicate that to everyone. - And communicate that to everyone, because if everyone your group wants to get a High Distinction and you want to get a pass, communicate to that, because maybe they might, I guess, compromise on a grade they want. - University is meant to be difficult. It's not meant to be easy in any sense of the word. We're stretching you academically. We're stretching you as a person to help you grow and move outside that comfort zone, so it shouldn't be surprising if you do find stuff hard, and you do struggle because we provide a lot of support for you. So, Caster, tell me about, are there any subjects where you struggled? - Yes, so one of the eight core subjects you do in a Bachelor of Business is called Business Statistics, which is focused on probability, regression analysis, and I know for me, I had the worst time trying to understand the concepts and trying to understand all this terminology, so I actually enrolled in a thing called U:PASS, which stands for-- - So ""U"" is university, and ""PASS"" stands for peer assisted study schemes. - Yeah, so basically, you don't learn new content. Rather, past students who have done really well in that particular subject actually reinforce the knowledge. You get the content. It's retaught to you, and it's really just a great way, it's a free service, by the way, it's a really great way of understanding the content from, I guess, a student perspective because the tutor, or the student, has actually done that subject before, and it's very colloquial, very casual, ask as many questions as you want, and, generally speaking, not many people apply to do them anyway. I think, when I did mine, it was only ten students, so you could really easily just ask the past student a question or a subject. - Yep. And U:PASS leaders are all trained, as well, so we just don't pick students and throw them into a room with other students who are struggling. We train them through a programme of learning how to not exactly say, ""This is the answer,"" but we train them to ask the right questions of students and structure the right activities so that you can figure it out for yourself with them guiding you, and that's really important because uni isn't just about learning the right answers to things, it's about learning the processes on how you get there. Because in a lot of subjects, there's a lot of judgement that needs to be made, and it's not always that ""A"" is the right answer. Sometimes ""A"" or ""B"" or ""C"" could be the right answer depending on how you explain it and justify your choices. So coming to uni is not just about learning ""A"" is the right answer or ""B"" is the right answer, it's about learning that process-- - And then there's multiple ways of doing things as well. - Absolutely, we want to teach you about different ways of thinking so that you can go out into the workplace and apply different ways of thinking and coming at things with diverse perspectives. So coming to university and having a degree in itself is not going to be enough to get you a job after graduation. Many years ago, that might have been the case, but now employers are looking for a lot more. They're looking for well-rounded candidates that have different sorts of experiences, and that can come from your part-time job, whether that's at McDonald's or working retail somewhere, or babysitting or teaching swimming, but the other thing they're looking for is real-life work experience. How do you get that as a student? - So at UTS, we have a free service called UTS Careers, and they actually help you find any job experience you're looking for whether it's an internship in the specialisation you're studying or if it's just something random you want to do. You can literally turn up to the door, say, ""I want this,"" and they will help you find it. They'll help you fix your resume, cover letter-- - They can even help you figure out what career you wanna go into. - Yeah, exactly, and then they'll just guide you through that process, and it's really, really great to have, I guess, someone else there to help you through that process 'cause it is quite overwhelming to write a cover letter about yourself know when you don't know what to write. So, it is a free service, and a lot of students don't know that we have that. - Yeah, so UTS Careers are also on Facebook and Instagram, so it's worth following them on there. There's also opportunities in some of our majors within our courses to do internships. So, internships can be anywhere from six to 12 weeks. They're usually 12-week programmes. In accounting, they're mainly over the summer period, but if you're doing an internship as part of a subject, typically, it will be in line with a regular semester, and quite often you'll have to find your own internship. They can help you a little bit in doing that through those different subjects. - Again, you can go through UTS Careers-- - You can go through Careers. - To help find an internship, or do something external. - Yep. And whether they're paid or unpaid will depend on the particular area. So in accounting, our summer vacation internships are all paid opportunities, but in other instances, they may be unpaid. It's always important to check that, whether your internship opportunity is a paid one or is an unpaid one. Now, you never should have to pay someone else to do an internship. So if someone says, ""I'll give you an internship ""if you pay me,"" if you have to pay, that's definitely worth talking with the Careers team at UTS about, just to make sure that that's not a scam because that's not something that is really common, that you'd have to pay to do an internship. - I think what makes UTS unique in terms of internships and our career services is that some of our courses you can actually, you touched upon it before about a subject, you can actually do your internship as part of your course, so if you do a Bachelor of Management, it's compulsory to do an internship, so I guess being forced to actually get experience and getting exposure in your relevant major is quite helpful, but in the Bachelor of Business, it depends if it's an elective. - Yeah, the UTS Careers runs Careers Fairs, so that's one where lots of employers will come specifically for business students or engineering students or IT students or nursing students, and then we'll also have the vacation and internships fair which runs a little bit later in the year, but if you're up-to-date with your social media, with UTS Careers, and UTS Business, then you'll get all of the information about that. Content includes: - The other thing to think about while you're at university is also the social side, because university isn't just about study, study, study. We want you to grow personally as well and develop new skills in leadership and empathy and understanding what it is to be part of a team. - And just to add to that, when you're applying for jobs, employers are actually gonna look at what you've done at university as well. Because wherever you graduate in Australia you're gonna get a good degree but how are you going to stand out from someone who's done a bachelor of business elsewhere in the country? - Yeah, and in my recent talks with a lot of graduate recruiters they've said, ""We're looking at academics, ""we're looking for leadership ""within some sort of university club or society, ""for some sort of relevant work experience, ""and then some other types of experiences."" And so that could be leading a sporting group or at a church or with a charity. So clubs and societies at UTS is a really great way to get to meet people. Caster happens to be president of one of our biggest societies, which is the UTS Business Society. Tell us what it's about. - So UTS Business Society, or you'll probably hear on campus, it's called BSoc. It's mainly a society run by business students for business students where we run-- - Not run by academics. - Not run by academics. - We have nothing to do with BSoc. - So a lot of the activities or the events we run are a lot of social events where we do give alcohol, we do give food, and it's a great opportunity to meet new people that do a bachelor of management, accounting, economics, business, or whatever. And it's just a really great way to just unwind from class, because a lot of our events are on the weekends or after class. And you can really socialise with people. - It's a good way to make friends. - Exactly. - I came to UTS not knowing anybody else at the uni. So BSoc is one of those great things. And they run events all throughout the year. And it's not just parties. - Yeah, we also do provide students a lot of academic help as well. Towards the end of our semester, or sessions I should say, we run exam workshops where we give questions that might help you, exam review notes, and things like that as well. - And I've also seen workshops on some key skills that often as academics we will assume students have. Like, knowing how to use Excel or knowing how to use Xero, which is an accounting software package. So there's a lot of great free education that comes with being part of a club. Now, there's the Business Society but there's also things like Quidditch, diving, Frisbee. - Food society. - There's a Food Society? - There's a society. There's like-- - There's a Dog Society. - We have also-- - The Photographic Society. - Language societies as well. So we have, I guess, we have our faculty-specific societies but then we also have these little random ones as well. - Yes, I've never actually seen the Quidditch Society playing Quidditch. I don't know how that actually works. But I've seen them at Clubs Day. That's a really important part of coming to Orientation. That whole week is about getting to learn how to navigate the university but also, Clubs Day is one of the best days where you can see all of the clubs, check them all out. Don't sign up to all of them. Pick, I would suggest two or three really key things that you think you'd be interested in. So do the lap around the clubs and societies first before you choose to sign up so that you can figure out where you're gonna spend your money and then get involved. It's really about becoming involved. When you're involved in a club it's not just, oh, I attend the things that the club sets up, but, how could you give back to your club and to other students? - The good thing about joining a club or a society, you don't actually know where you might end up. I signed up for BSoc way back in 2017 when I was a first year as well. I went to O'Day or Clubs Day and then I applied to come on the team then I progressed my role into president. So that's three years later. So you don't know what's gonna happen when you join things like that. - Absolutely. And it's really about meeting different people as well. - Yep, exactly. - So if you're interested in joining BSoc, you can go to their Facebook page, UTS Business Society, you can join at Clubs Day, and there's also a camp. So a camp is the event specifically for first year students. Does the camp cost money? - Yes, it does. Usually what we do is at Clubs Day or O'Day we actually have a deal where if you sign up with us, sorry, if you buy a camp ticket, you get a discounted membership as well. - Fantastic, and how much is the camp usually? - So usually it's a little over $200, but that's inclusive of food, your accommodation, alcohol, and yeah. - And it's not run by academics. - Yeah, it's not. - So there are no teachers coming along to the camp. I don't think I wanna come along to the camp. Now, there are no academics that go along to the camp. It's all run by the students. There are no academics talking about study or anything like that. My understanding, from what I see in the pictures, is it's just students having a good time. - Yeah, it really is. This year we went to Broken Bay, which is up north. There was actually no mobile reception at all so we basically forced everyone to talk to each other. But it was actually kind of helpful because a lot of people are still friends now. So it's just a really great way to, I guess, it's usually held in the second or third week of uni, which is quite overwhelming for some students, so it's a really great weekend getaway to get away from the city, get away from UTS, get away from your assessments and your computer, and just really make friends. - Cool. - Yeah. - So there's clubs, there's events like the Peer Networkers. We even have something on Fridays where the university supplies the pizza for something called TalkFest. So if English is not your first language and you think, I'd like to develop my English language skill a lot more, you can be a volunteer to be a conversation starter at TalkFest or you can attend as well as a student. So it's students and staff developing those skills and building those bonds of friendship. That's really, really important. You're gonna have a huge learning curve at university and that becomes a lot easier if you make friends. And I know it's really scary 'cause I'm not one of these people that on the first day was like, hi, I'm Amanda! But it's an important skill to learn to go out there into the business world and if you can start and take that very first step at your very first event and to the person next to you, say hi, I'm so and so, and strike up that conversation then that's a skill that's going to be really beneficial for the rest of your university degree and the rest of your business career. Where do you go for coffee on campus? - I actually go to a place called Chambers Coffee, which is down on Haymarket near the old library, just because they do 10% discounts. But I'm sure most cafes on campus do that, if you're a UTS student. And I'm usually based down in Building 5 'cause that's where most of my classes are, so it's just convenient for me. And they just know me. - I think all coffee, there's heaps of different coffee places on campus. We're here in Building 2 and we can see a coffee hub just down there. There's great coffee at the Universal Cafeteria. It's not really a cafeteria, it's just a cafe, in Building 6. - Cafe 80 in Building 8 is quite good as well. - Cafe 80 in Building 8. We have a cafe down here in Building 2. So you're not short on options for coffee. If you're after a cheap coffee, you can't beat the $1 coffee from 7-Eleven. - 7-Eleven, yep. - It's not fabulous coffee but it's cheap and it has lots of-- - It does the job. It does the job. - It does the job if you're after caffeine. If you're after artisanal coffee then it's not for you. Where do you get a drink on campus? We do have a bar on campus. - Yeah, it's called The Underground. They do do happy hour, I think it's like to four to six, or three to six. My go-to G&T, gin and tonic, I go to Underground. And it's just a great way to, again, make new friends, because-- - It's a student hangout. - It's a student hangout area. - Not a staff hangout. - Yeah, so you won't see any academics there, you won't see any teaching staff there. That would be weird if you did. - We go to The Loft. - The Loft is quite good - The Loft is a different sort of, - as well. - it's more like a little cocktail bar on campus. - And it's outside as well, so yeah. - From where I'm sitting I can see like three different bars. So I used to go to, as a student, Bar Broadway, which is just down on Broadway. There's The Old Clare, which is owned by the family of a former UTS student. - Something that's trending at the moment is Fratelli Fresh. - Fratelli Fresh. This is Caster's favourite. - I am literally at Fratelli Fresh every week because-- - I don't have my little chip but if you become a member there's like $10 pasta on, - I have one in my bag as well. - there's $10 pastas on Mondays. - Happy hour's three to six. If you wanna make new friends, if you see me, come up to me at Fratelli Fresh 'cause I'll say hi. - We're not short on places to drink. - Yeah, and the thing-- - Cafe 80 serves drinks too. - Yeah, I think that's the good thing about UTS is you're gonna find a lot of places to eat, a lot of places to unwind. So that's our advantage. - In terms of eating, at some universities you'll be stuck with whatever the options are on campus. We have fantastic options here on campus. So downstairs in Building 2, or UTS Central, we have a brand new food court that is plastic-free. You'll see things that look like plastic. That's actually PLA, which is compostable. What have you tried downstairs in Building, in the new food court? - I actually haven't tried anything at Building 2 food court. - God. - But I do wanna-- - Kebabs are good. - But I do wanna recommend something else. - Oh, ooh. - You have to try any dumpling place in Chinatown, which, I see it-- - There are lots of dumpling places in Chinatown. - It's cheap as well, and they fill you up. You might feel gross at the end, maybe, a little bit. - I don't think this is never anything I've had. - But they are really good and must-do. - It's a must. - Must-do. - If you leave your UTS experience without ever having had dumplings, - You didn't go to UTS. - you haven't been to UTS. - You haven't gone to UTS. - So that's a key thing. Downstairs in the food court on level whatever it is downstairs, I've tried PappaRich, which is great. There's Chatime for your bubble tea, which is great to have bubble tea on campus. The kebab place is great. - Uni Bros. - Uni Bros is the kebab place. - Sorry, so I have tried something at UTS Central. - Mad Mex downstairs. I think there's Japanese as well. So we have a whole lot right within the building. Across the street from us is a huge shopping centre called Central Park where there's Din Tai Fung and a whole lot of other food places. Just down near Haymarket we have Market City. There's all of Chinatown. The cheapest lunch, I believe an economist told me, is the $2 sandwich at 7-Eleven. But there's also plenty of supermarkets nearby. So if you're on a high protein diet, I have a colleague who goes and she buys an entire roast chicken and a salad and that will be like her lunch for the week. - My go-to snack is the chicken chippies at Woollies or cheese and bacon rolls 'cause they're just easy to put in your bag and eat walking to and from class and they're quite cheap-ish, enough, to buy. - Now, if you're super concientious and you're bringing your lunch from home, unfortunately there are no fridge facilities on campus but there are microwaves on campus and there is hot water as well. So if you bring one of those cup of noodle things - Two minute noodles. - then those are always really great to have. Now, you can actually hire a locker at uni. So when I was a student I hired a locker and I stashed in there some muesli bars, a few noodle cups, and some other things, like a spare jumper, that sort of stuff. That's always good and handy to have on hand. That was before we had supermarkets. Now you can just go across to the supermarket and buy something. If you run out of places to eat at UTS then there's something really wrong because I don't think I've eaten at all the places and I studied here for four years and now I've been working here for 18 years so-- - And you're still finding new places to eat. - I'm still finding new places to eat. And we have great facilities. There's no swimming pool at UTS but there is an aquatic centre just down the road if you're into swimming. But the UTS gym is really great and there are reasonable rates for students as well. It's not just free weights and open gym, there's also lots of different classes that you can get involved in. Caster, have you been to the gym? - No, but you sometimes in orientation packs, you might get like a free two-week trial or two-day trial. - Oh, cool. Take advantage of that. - I've gotten that before. If you wanted to test the gym, that's a good way of doing it. - Awesome. Content includes: - I think one thing that confuses everybody is the word session. - Yes. - What exactly is a session? Session is our word for semester, or term. So Uni's have different names for them, but we call them sessions. We have our autumn session, our spring session, which is semester two, and our summer session, which sorta goes over the summer period-- - And that's optional. - Summer is optional, it's not compulsory, unless you're in the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation-- - Yes, yeah. - Which there is some summer classes. GPAs and WAMs, what's a GPA? - It means grade point average. - Cha-ching! 10 points. - Which basically is, I guess it's just a mark when you get some results back from your semester. - Yes. So when you get your results back, you'll get numbers, which are the results and the score for that subject. You'll also get a grade. So our grading system, from the top, is high distinction, distinction, credit, pass-- - And fail. - Fail. Then there are withhelds. For some reason you don't get a grade, you get a withheld. And then there are things called X Grades, where you don't meet one requirement of that particular subject. GPAs are calculated by taking a score for your grade, high distinction, distinction, credit, pass, and then you get, you know, if you get a whole lot of distinctions, your grade point average will be based on that particular grade, not on the actual mark. So the WAM, which you may see in some places, is your weighted average mark. So that basically takes all of your marks, and then it averages them, and then you get a number score. But the GPA is a number, but it's really based on your grade. It's a little bit complicated, but there's some information on the UTS website, where you can figure that out. - A major is something that you decide to specialise in. So in the Bachelor of Business, which I think has, what, 10 majors? 10 majors, so things like accounting, economics, finance, management, they're the ones that you decide you want to specialise in, or your area of expertise. - Yep. And a sub-major? - Is basically the same, but you do half the subjects you want to. - So sub-majors are half a major. - Of a major. - Yep. And in most of our degrees in the undergraduate programme, Bachelor of Business you can do two majors. That's pretty similar in the Bachelor of Economics and other degrees, where you're gonna get lots of choices. Now don't worry about making any of your choices straightaway when you start Uni, because everybody does the core. What's the core? - So, in a Bachelor of Business, you do a eight core subjects. So you do a mixture of accounting, finance, management, economics, and then really just a taste test of subjects to help you decide what area of expertise you want to specialise in. And then probably around October, I think, when you do your enrollments for the following year, that's when you actually decide your major that you wanna do. - So don't worry if you're not sure what your major is. We do lots to support students in helping them figure out what their career path options are, and what their major is, and picking the right subjects about that. So don't think about being concerned about that straightaway. Content includes: - Now you're probably thinking, I'm coming up to week one, what on earth do I need to do to get prepared? Carston, what's the first thing students should do? - Enrol in your subjects. - Yes, please enrol. - Because a lot of us students, they think that you enrol in your subjects, that's it. But you actually have to put your timetable in your classes as well. And they fill up extremely fast. - So you go into your One Stop Student Admin, you'll be able to see the subjects that you're enrolled in, you need to pick your lecture time, and your tutorial times. Now what happens if the tutorial time that you want to go to is full? You just keep checking. The system will show live vacancies, so if Carston drops out of a subject, that's what will free up immediately and you can jump on. - A pro tip, a lot of people jump out of like a week or two before semester starts, session starts. So that's a prime time to check the timetable. - Or even in that first week. 'Cause you can sort of chop and change around tutorials for the first few weeks. We sort of expect that as academics, as students realise the subject is not for them or it doesn't work with their timetable. So it's really important to make sure that you know exactly which tutorials you're in, especially the number. Because there might be more than one tutorial at the same time. So don't say to a friend, ""Oh let's enrol in the four o'clock one,"" because you might be in different rooms at four o'clock. Check that actual number. When you're looking at your timetable, it'll give you room numbers. How exactly do you read room numbers? - So the way UTS structures their room locations is first by building number, level in that building, and then the room number. But there's, honestly, a lot of signage at UTS. What I actually did my first year was, because you do the eight core subjects, you actually just see a herd of people go to that classroom and you know, you just know, that it's that subject. So that's just a big way of knowing that you're going to the right classroom. - That's how you end up in the wrong room. - No, I actually think it's the opposite. And also, at the entrance of most UTS lectures or tutorials, there's actually a TV screen that says what the subject is, the activity number, and you can actually just see if you're in the right classroom. - Yeah, I was a real nerd. And I actually went and I found all of my rooms in Orientation, so that I knew where to go. - I did the same thing as well I did the same thing as well - So that's always a good thing that you can do if you're feeling really UTS nerdy. There's also an app. So if you go to WayFinding.UTS.edu.au, you can actually type in the room number, and it'll show you exactly where it is. Because UTS isn't exactly a building that's full of straight hallways where rooms are just down one long line. We've got lots of curves, lots of weird angles. So you might think, ""Oh this is the end of this hallway,"" but it might turn at some point. So you need to check that at sometimes if you're a bit stuck for rooms. So UTS Online is where all of your learning materials are stored for your different subjects. You'll be able to go in ahead of time and look at what you need to do for week one. There might be a video to watch from your coordinator. That'll give you some hints and tips. - Make sure you're familiar with the document called your Subject Outline. This is very important. This is basically like your bible for the subjects. So you get one for each of your subjects. And it literally goes through the staff contacts, the teaching staff. The 12 or 13 weeks, and what content you'll actually learn, and get taught, and then also details about your assessments. And the good thing about Subject Outlines is they already have the due dates for your assessments on there. So if you really are nerdy, and if you really do want to get a move on your assessments, - it's not just nerds! I reckon everybody should write out on their calendar when stuff is due. - Yeah, I do the same thing. And also information about your textbook, and maybe where you might be able to find that as well. So it's only what, 10 or 12 pages? It's not that long. - It's not that long. It's definitely worth reading. It's your contract with the academic, and it sets out everything they intend to do, and it also sets out your responsibility. So, how often you need to turn up to class, what you need to do to prepare. Because in some classes it might be to hand in something each week. - Some classes there might be nothing at all. - Some classes there might be nothing at all. Sometimes there's homework. Sometimes that homework has to be hand written depending on the individual coordinator. So it's important to check all of that. They will talk about that also in your first weeks of class. - But it's good to have read it before you go to that week one. - Now textbooks is going to be an interesting one, because previously we always went to the co-op bookshop to buy our textbooks. We no longer have a co-op bookshop on campus. Check your individual subject outlines because that will say, and have the information on the best place to buy the book. Most of the time you can purchase from the co-op bookshop online, and they will ship books straight to you. You can also go to the individual publishers and often each subject coordinator will have a special discount code where you can get extra discounts on the the textbooks. You can also try Book Depository, Fishpond, Textbook Exchange. - Just on that actually, Facebook has a lot of groups for second-hand textbooks, and that's a really great way of getting your books cheap. - Saving some money. - Because textbooks are very expensive. - And they go out of date really quickly. - So being able to just literally go on Facebook, type in textbook exchange, first one that comes up, and just add yourself to it. It's a great way of saving a lot of money. - Check the edition number. Because a common one is that a textbook might change over the break, and if you buy the wrong edition, then you won't actually get the right homework questions. Sometimes the content in the book might be pretty similar, but the homework questions might be different. And if you have to hand those in, you might not be handing in the right stuff. - And also, in the case your subject is an open book exam, or a research book exam where you're allowed to bring a textbook in and you have a wrong edition, the exam supervisor is just gonna take it away from you. - One key thing that you'll need everywhere you go at UTS. Whether that's to class, into the library, into the exams, is what? - Your student card, student ID card. - And so it is your lifeline. It's the way that you prove yourself, who you are at university to gain access to the library, so make sure that ahead of time you've uploaded your photo. Now there are lots of instructions online on how to do that. It needs to be - Passport requirements. - Similar to your passport. So I think you have to take your glasses off, minimal makeup. You can smile but there's no teeth? - Or just any neutral expression, I think. - Neutral expression. So do a neutral expression. - No, I can't! - Yeah, so he can't do it, right? So practise doing your neutral expressions. Nobody looks glamorous in their student or staff ID photo. - Everyone looks ugly. - We all look a bit, yes, dangerous. I think it looks a bit like a mugshot. So make sure that you bring that with you because in some places you won't be able to gain access, and after hours, security staff will actually ask to see your ID. And you'll have to bring it to exams as well to prove that it's really you sitting in the exam. - You also need to take your ID every time you have your concession, which is the grey, oh, so your concession Opal card which is the grey coloured one. And you need to take that with you everywhere that you use it, because the transit offices actually check and ask for your ID. - You definitely don't want to get one of those $200 fines. - Yeah, $200 fines. - Yeah, absolutely. Now how do you get a concession card? - So you actually have to apply for that after you've done all your enrollments, and there's a tab, I think it calls up government forms through one stop admin. Form is pretty self-explanatory. And then it comes within two weeks, I think. So make sure you enrol as soon as you can to get that concession benefits if you want to, because I think the adult Opal is very expensive. - Yeah, otherwise you'll have to pay adult fares to come to uni. The sooner you apply for it the better, and make sure that you have it with you at all times. It's your passport to study at University as well. We recommend attending from week one. So don't think, ""Oh, nothing happens in week one."" In week one, my students start learning content and skills from that very first week. So if you turn up a little bit late, then you're missing out on forming groups, getting to know people in the class, learning the basics. So it's really important that you turn up those first few weeks. How much stuff do you need to bring to uni? What do you bring? - So I usually just have maybe my computer, my MacBook, a pen and a paper, because you never know when you might need to rip something out. And make sure you bring a jumper, because the lecture rooms and corridors are always cold for some reason, even if it's hot outside, or even if it's winter they're just always cold. So just having some sort of like a thin jumper, and also make sure you bring water as well. Because your mouth just gets dry with all the air and talking with other people. - Bring a water bottle. - Make sure it's plastic free, make sure it's a plastic free water bottle. - Oh yeah, there are, I have a plastic one, but-- - UTS has a few, well actually a lot of water refill stations as well. - Water refill stations and as well, if you've got a keep cup for coffee, you can always rinse it out in one of the kitchens, that's always a good plan. - And of course, carry your student ID card everywhere you go. - Carry your student ID card. I do have some students that come without a pen. It's always a good idea to bring one pen, and at least a little bit of paper. - You might not think you might write something, but you never know when you just need to rip something out or whatever happens and you just have a pen handy. - Share details with group members or something like that, that's always a good thing to have. But I wouldn't necessarily always bring my textbooks to uni. - No, no, no. - So sometimes they can be really heavy, and we want to have good occupational health and safety. You might choose to buy electronic textbooks, because sometimes you can buy a physical book that might also give you an electronic book. There are also services out there that allow you to rent an electronic textbook if you don't have an exam that requires you to bring a book. - Which is also another great way of saving money if you want to rent textbooks. - Is rentals, yeah, cool. One thing that you need to have is your tax file number. Now your tax file number is needed so that if you're not paying your fees up front, - So you're deferring them. - And you're deferring your fees until you get a job and then you'll start paying them later, then you must have a tax file number. How do you go about applying for one? - I actually had, back in I actually applied my tax file number through my careers advisor. But I'm sure if, you know, use your common sense. I'm sure if you do apply TFN or tax file number on Google it's gonna come up with a form. - Yeah, so you go to the ATO, so ato.gov.au which is the Australian Tax Office, and there will be information there on how to apply for your tax file number. If you've had a part time job before, then it will be the same number. If you've not had a job before, then you'll need to apply for one. And then submit that with your documentation for your hex fees. - Yeah, so you need to have your tax file number when you submit the hex debt form, because that's how they identify that that's who you are. - Yes, and you might also need your tax file number if you're going for an internship as well, so it's important to have that handy. And if you don't remember, I memorised my tax file number. It's a good thing that as an adult you memorise your tax file number as well. - I just have mine written in notes somewhere, but yeah, you can memorise it if you want. - Why wouldn't you memorise your tax file, it's important numbers! I remember important phone numbers, my kid's birthday, my tax file number. Maybe that's just accountant, I don't know. - Yeah, maybe it's an accountant thing. Just be open to any changes or opportunities that come to UTS. I know a lot of first years when they come to UTS or any university they think, ""Oh, three years, ""it's over and done, we do nothing."" but once you start university you actually realise that there's a lot of things that you can do. So, just keep that in mind and just be open and embrace change and all that. - My tip would be something similar. I think this is such an exciting time to be at university with changes in technology and amazing new things that we're doing here at UTS and across all of higher education in Australia. So my tip to students would be open to saying, ""Yes."" Someone comes up to you with an opportunity just think about saying yes, because you never know where that yes might take you in terms of where your career might end up. So, we hope this has been useful. If there are any further questions that we haven't managed to answer, then definitely get in contact with one of our UTS Student Centres. You can contact them online, by the website, fire email, in person, over the phone. But otherwise we will see you at one of our UTS Welcomes as part of orientation.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/transdisciplinary-innovation/undergraduate-courses/creative-intelligence-and-innovation/combining-bcii-your-core-degree,"Interested in studying Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation (BCII), but not sure how it will combine with your core degree at UTS? We’ve asked seven UTS students from different disciplines and backgrounds to provide their experience on how the BCII has added value to their core degrees. You can check them out below. Interested in combining your Business degree with the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation (BCII)? Hear from recent graduate Sophie Phillips on how the BCII has added value to her Business degree at UTS. 0:00:10.050,0:00:12.120 Unknown Speaker 0:09 I went to Abbotsleigh school. 0:00:12.120,0:00:15.050 I graduated back in 2014. 0:00:15.050,0:00:19.640 And then I studied a Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of BCII at UTS. 0:00:19.640,0:00:25.930 I wrapped up at UTS about a year and a half ago. 0:00:25.930,0:00:34.220 And now I'm working full time as an analyst at Accenture in the financial services industry. 0:00:34.220,0:00:40.300 Unknown Speaker 0:36 So I decided to study BCII with business because 0:00:40.300,0:00:44.440 I guess I always had a bit of an interest in entrepreneurship. 0:00:44.440,0:00:52.219 And studying regular business degree obviously gives you a great foundation for kind of all 0:00:52.219,0:00:57.359 those different areas, but I think BCII was really where it kind of got exciting for me. 0:00:57.359,0:01:05.110 I'm actually quite curious about other areas, obviously working in a transdisciplinary degree. 0:01:05.110,0:01:10.440 And I definitely say that when I was in high school, I obviously had areas I was interested 0:01:10.440,0:01:13.170 in, but I wasn't necessarily particularly good at one thing. 0:01:13.170,0:01:17.940 I kind of liked to have a bit of my foot in a lot of different areas. 0:01:17.940,0:01:24.391 So something like BCII was going to keep me interested and really, I guess in tune with 0:01:24.391,0:01:32.840 a lot of different other areas by studying a transdisciplinary degree, so there you go. 0:01:32.840,0:01:41.090 Unknown Speaker 1:35 Life Changing, mind blowing, and uplifting, 0:01:41.090,0:01:43.110 or inspiring. 0:01:43.110,0:01:49.360 I'd have to say those three words because it's definitely one of the most incredible 0:01:49.360,0:01:57.591 experiences that I have kind of run with since leaving school, and I came away from it with 0:01:57.591,0:02:03.131 a really inspiring network of people, that I studied with, and they continue to inspire 0:02:03.131,0:02:12.849 me since leaving UTS, so I'd have to say, those are the three words that I'd use. 0:02:12.849,0:02:18.310 Unknown Speaker 2:15 Now that I'm out, kind of working full time 0:02:18.310,0:02:24.100 in the real world, I have to say, it has never really it didn't really resonate with me until 0:02:24.100,0:02:29.330 I got out and kind of started working full time. 0:02:29.330,0:02:34.420 The nature of like real world problem solving, I suppose they tell you that in BCII, and 0:02:34.420,0:02:38.230 you do get to like interact with real life clients and things like that. 0:02:38.230,0:02:41.410 But now that I guess I'm kind of out on my own. 0:02:41.410,0:02:46.930 It makes me super grateful for those experiences that I did have in BCII. 0:02:46.930,0:02:53.319 Unknown Speaker 2:50 BCII really made me think quite differently 0:02:53.319,0:02:59.310 about my business degree particularly because I chose a marketing major now the marketing 0:02:59.310,0:03:06.200 major at UTS does have quite a very strong groupwork component to it, which, to many 0:03:06.200,0:03:08.480 other business students was quite intimidating. 0:03:08.480,0:03:16.230 But for a lot of the BCII business students, group work was not overwhelming, it was not 0:03:16.230,0:03:21.220 something that was kind of something that people will look forward to rather than dreading. 0:03:21.220,0:03:27.110 I think once you learn some really effective collaboration styles and different methods 0:03:27.110,0:03:34.200 that are taught and you put into practice in BCII, it makes group work that much easier. 0:03:34.200,0:03:39.860 And like I said, it's something you look forward to so yeah, definitely really took me to the 0:03:39.860,0:03:42.470 next level in business. 0:03:42.470,0:03:49.050 Unknown Speaker 3:46 My favourite memory from BCII would have to 0:03:49.050,0:03:52.870 be in my final fourth year industry innovation projects. 0:03:52.870,0:04:00.870 This was something that I feel I was so lucky to experience that particular time I was lucky 0:04:00.870,0:04:07.459 enough to work with Merivale - transforming nightlife for 18 to 25 year olds. 0:04:07.459,0:04:12.410 And at that particular point in time it was there were quite contentious issues being 0:04:12.410,0:04:18.609 discussed around the lockout laws and how I guess Sydney nightlife had taken a bit of 0:04:18.609,0:04:19.609 a blow. 0:04:19.609,0:04:23.190 And so there were a lot of kind of complexities behind the problem that we were trying to 0:04:23.190,0:04:25.710 uncover. 0:04:25.710,0:04:31.169 And I suppose from Merivale's perspective, I understand what that particular demographic 0:04:31.169,0:04:37.819 was looking for when they were going out on a night out and I guess I did fall into that 0:04:37.819,0:04:39.190 particular target segment. 0:04:39.190,0:04:45.120 So there was a lot of research involved but it was honestly so much fun. 0:04:45.120,0:04:51.389 Got to really kind of cement ourselves in the Merivale team. 0:04:51.389,0:04:58.900 And funnily enough, this was quite a good stepping stone in my final year of uni before 0:04:58.900,0:05:06.939 moving into consulting the following year because it was really a great lesson in client 0:05:06.939,0:05:12.819 relationship management and, you know, building expectations, try to take the client on a 0:05:12.819,0:05:14.999 journey and co create something. 0:05:14.999,0:05:23.060 So at the end, it's really an outcome that everyone is after, and obviously solves the 0:05:23.060,0:05:25.940 problem at the crux of it. 0:05:25.940,0:05:29.529 So, yeah, that was definitely my most memorable experience. 0:05:29.529,0:05:36.650 And I still catch up very regularly with that group of people that I did that project with. 0:05:36.650,0:05:44.600 Unknown Speaker 5:41 Definitely been, obviously the incredible 0:05:44.600,0:05:50.479 lessons and methodologies and practices that I've taken away from the degree but it would 0:05:50.479,0:05:57.069 also have to be the incredible network that I've kind of developed over the course of 0:05:57.069,0:06:02.229 the four year degree, the BCII degree at UTS. 0:06:02.229,0:06:07.370 BCII is quite a unique course, I guess, in that you're working with all these different 0:06:07.370,0:06:13.030 transdisciplinary people on completely different problems spaces all the time, you get to understand 0:06:13.030,0:06:22.539 the nuances of how each person works and really understand their skill sets and where they 0:06:22.539,0:06:27.849 kind of shine in different areas, very different areas necessarily to what you might be interested 0:06:27.849,0:06:29.780 in or you excel at. 0:06:29.780,0:06:36.139 But just being able to kind of work alongside these people, you learn the kind of intrinsics 0:06:36.139,0:06:38.439 of how they actually work. 0:06:38.439,0:06:43.669 And I must say now, having worked with those people, and still kind of remaining quite 0:06:43.669,0:06:47.360 close with that network once I've left. 0:06:47.360,0:06:53.279 It's awesome to follow the progress that they've made since graduating and being able to collaborate 0:06:53.279,0:06:58.189 on many different things as well once leaving uni. 0:06:58.189,0:07:05.229 Unknown Speaker 7:02 I'd have to say, studying combined degree 0:07:05.229,0:07:11.800 was extremely useful for me as I was seeking jobs towards the end of uni. 0:07:11.800,0:07:15.360 BCII is absolutely something that stands out on the resume. 0:07:15.360,0:07:23.360 And you'll often find that a lot of people who I guess, do kind of work at these really 0:07:23.360,0:07:27.189 interesting jobs that you might be trying to seek. 0:07:27.189,0:07:32.370 They're working at the intersection of knowledge, they're working in somewhat of a transdisciplinary 0:07:32.370,0:07:33.370 nature. 0:07:33.370,0:07:38.789 They might have studied, maybe not BCII, but they have these two kind of different areas 0:07:38.789,0:07:45.039 of knowledge or maybe multiple that come together and have an interesting way of bringing new 0:07:45.039,0:07:46.699 things to the table. 0:07:46.699,0:07:52.839 So BCII in itself, once I kind of explained it to people as I was throughout the recruitment 0:07:52.839,0:07:57.759 process, they found that extremely, extremely useful. 0:07:57.759,0:08:03.649 In a mindset, it's more of a mindset, really then a skill set, as doesn't matter what your 0:08:03.649,0:08:09.179 core foundation of knowledge is, as long as you are open and you know how to kind of collaborate 0:08:09.179,0:08:17.699 across different disciplines that in itself is an extremely valuable and useful skill 0:08:17.699,0:08:20.409 once you have left uni. 0:08:20.409,0:08:27.679 Unknown Speaker 8:25 To other students who might be thinking about 0:08:27.679,0:08:32.979 studying BCII with business, it's an extremely useful combination. 0:08:32.979,0:08:38.099 I have to say I was really interested in entrepreneurship before starting uni. 0:08:38.099,0:08:43.709 However, once I actually got into BCII, I came across this term intrapreneurship where 0:08:43.709,0:08:47.780 people might be doing, you know, some really game changing innovative things but within 0:08:47.780,0:08:50.550 a huge organisation. 0:08:50.550,0:08:55.410 And so I'd have to say that if that's something that interests you, or even just entrepreneurship 0:08:55.410,0:09:01.490 in general, it absolutely is a great combination, and you'll take a lot from the experience. Interested in combining your Communications degree with the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation (BCII)? Hear from recent graduate Julia McNamara on how the BCII has added value to her Communications degree at UTS. 0:00:10.320,0:00:11.580 Hey, my name is Julia. 0:00:11.580,0:00:15.340 I've always really loved English and drama growing up. 0:00:15.340,0:00:20.320 So when I went to university, I really wanted to both have the opportunity to explore that 0:00:20.320,0:00:23.750 further, but I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do. 0:00:23.750,0:00:28.510 So I wanted to do as much as possible, which is why I decided to do a communications degree 0:00:28.510,0:00:32.470 with a double major in PR and Media Arts Production. 0:00:32.470,0:00:42.050 And then also do the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation as well. 0:00:42.050,0:00:46.329 I decided to study the BCII and combine it with my communications degree because I really 0:00:46.329,0:00:50.680 wanted to add and enrich to what I was going to learn in communications plus, like having 0:00:50.680,0:00:53.740 a degree in innovation sounded pretty snazzy. 0:00:53.740,0:00:57.461 And also, it was a relatively new degree, when I first started it. 0:00:57.461,0:01:01.350 I think they just had their first graduates cohort. 0:01:01.350,0:01:05.840 And the news that was coming out of it was really cool. 0:01:05.840,0:01:11.070 Like I remember my careers advisor just absolutely raving about what it could mean and the opportunities 0:01:11.070,0:01:16.360 that it could give me as somebody just starting out their career. 0:01:16.360,0:01:26.210 If I had to describe BCII in three words, it would be driven, relevant and absolutely 0:01:26.210,0:01:32.970 life changing. 0:01:32.970,0:01:38.850 It's funny, even studying BCII actually helped directly with my ability to succeed in my 0:01:38.850,0:01:40.799 core degree and my communications degree. 0:01:40.799,0:01:46.890 I know in particular, when we were doing group assignments, and when we were having those 0:01:46.890,0:01:50.850 more intricate kind of strategy and pitching presentations. 0:01:50.850,0:01:55.360 Having that, again, that knowledge, that ability to think creatively, to explore that problem 0:01:55.360,0:02:02.229 space and to work collaboratively in transdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary team's totally changed 0:02:02.229,0:02:06.869 the way I approached those assignments and meant that I was able to deliver a product 0:02:06.869,0:02:15.760 that was above standard. 0:02:15.760,0:02:20.389 Something that really struck home for me over these past four years with BCII is that in 0:02:20.389,0:02:25.800 the future, I'm not only ever going to be working with communications professionals, 0:02:25.800,0:02:28.040 it's going to be transdisciplinary. 0:02:28.040,0:02:32.199 We're going to have to work with people from other disciplines who think in different ways, 0:02:32.199,0:02:36.420 and to be able to bring that knowledge together, create something new and then move forward 0:02:36.420,0:02:37.420 with that. 0:02:37.420,0:02:44.419 So I think without having the understanding of transdisciplinary skills, that skill set 0:02:44.419,0:02:50.770 and having learned that through BCII, it just be another blocker to success. 0:02:50.770,0:02:55.799 That's why learning transdisciplinary skills I think is so important. 0:02:55.799,0:03:04.660 I was lucky enough to be part of the first honours cohort, so doing my honours in creative 0:03:04.660,0:03:09.970 intelligence and innovation, which, to be very honest, is as cool as it sounds. 0:03:09.970,0:03:12.220 If you think it sounds cool I do. 0:03:12.220,0:03:17.940 But I was able to take my passion for theatre in the arts, and then completely explore that 0:03:17.940,0:03:24.079 in this crazy cool way, with the help of the faculty, my peers, and all this transdisciplinary 0:03:24.079,0:03:29.220 skill set that I just built over the past three, three and a half years. 0:03:29.220,0:03:35.139 So I took that love, like brought in a bit of resilience theory, got to travel to Geelong, 0:03:35.139,0:03:41.840 made a verbatim script, wrote a little thesis and then had this again, what I think was 0:03:41.840,0:03:47.430 really fun, really cool and super interesting, like something that I was super passionate 0:03:47.430,0:03:55.540 about body of work at the end of it, that you know, put a little bow on their's my honours, 0:03:55.540,0:04:02.010 it's really fun. 0:04:02.010,0:04:06.400 Most interesting project that I was involved in was the industry innovation project we 0:04:06.400,0:04:11.380 did in our fourth year, we were able to work with an industry partner, again, like we do 0:04:11.380,0:04:13.660 for most of the schools. 0:04:13.660,0:04:17.470 But instead of it being within that two week time frame, we actually were able to stretch 0:04:17.470,0:04:22.820 it out for a few months, I found that really cool to be able to dive in and explore their 0:04:22.820,0:04:28.310 innovation strategies, how they thought, and then how we could support that. 0:04:28.310,0:04:35.600 Yeah, it was super interesting like working with my fellow BCII team, getting to completely 0:04:35.600,0:04:43.230 change both our mindset and theirs and then to have this product at the end of it. 0:04:43.230,0:04:53.970 Which would then help them promote and increase innovation into the future. 0:04:53.970,0:05:00.630 I'm working as a business designer for the Australian arm of a global innovation consultancy. 0:05:00.630,0:05:04.160 Which is really cool, to be honest, I didn't think this would ever be something within 0:05:04.160,0:05:05.160 my career trajectory. 0:05:05.160,0:05:11.020 Like especially I was working in marketing for the past three years throughout University. 0:05:11.020,0:05:15.190 But the way it came about was actually through BCII. 0:05:15.190,0:05:21.210 Like the company I'm working at Business Models Inc. did a workshop in class, I got a coffee 0:05:21.210,0:05:27.430 with one of the facilitators because I was just really intrigued towards what they do. 0:05:27.430,0:05:33.150 And yeah, kind of all flowed on from there. 0:05:33.150,0:05:39.360 But it's crazy to think about because without BCII without that innovation skill set and 0:05:39.360,0:05:46.920 without that transdisciplinary understanding, where I've gone would be completely different. 0:05:46.920,0:05:51.400 And I'm really fortunate that I did have that, and that i am on the path I'm on today 0:05:51.400,0:06:02.900 If you're thinking of combining BCII with comms, you should definitely do it. 0:06:02.900,0:06:05.940 Our future is changing so rapidly. 0:06:05.940,0:06:13.000 And communications itself is in a constant state of evolution like having the opportunities, 0:06:13.000,0:06:17.610 the skill sets the chance to connect industry partners and the peer group that you have 0:06:17.610,0:06:23.960 in BCII will only ever enrich your understanding of communications and the possibilities that 0:06:23.960,0:06:25.450 you'll have in the future. 0:06:25.450,0:06:27.710 So yeah, definitely do it would be my advice. 0:06:27.710,0:06:29.830 I'm a bit biased though. Interested in combining your Design degree with the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation (BCII)? Hear from UTS student Joel Meredith on how the BCII has added value to his Product Design degree at UTS. 0:00:10.710,0:00:13.150 Joel Meredith 0:10 So Hello, my name is Joel Meredith and I do 0:00:13.150,0:00:17.300 a double degree in integrated product design and creative intelligence and innovation. 0:00:17.300,0:00:21.170 Joel Meredith 0:17 When I came out of high school in 2015, I 0:00:21.170,0:00:27.620 graduated from the Scotts college I was definitely focusing a lot around design technology. a 0:00:27.620,0:00:32.160 I enjoyed the whole major work I had so much fun kind of developing that product over the 0:00:32.160,0:00:36.440 course of 12 months that I thought I would take it into my Educational Studies, which 0:00:36.440,0:00:41.930 is why I elected to do the product design and BCII double degree. 0:00:41.930,0:00:49.399 Joel Meredith 0:46 So I decided to take on BCII as a double degree 0:00:49.399,0:00:53.989 because I wanted to gain the additional skills required to both understand these different 0:00:53.989,0:00:59.399 kind of parts of the industry and more importantly to be able to collaborate with different stakeholders 0:00:59.399,0:01:01.359 in these projects moving forward as well. 0:01:01.359,0:01:08.180 So I thought BCII would give me the communication problem solving skills to be able to facilitate 0:01:08.180,0:01:09.180 that. 0:01:09.180,0:01:12.740 Joel Meredith 1:11 I feel like okay, if I was going to describe 0:01:12.740,0:01:15.420 BCII in three words, definitely collaborative. 0:01:15.420,0:01:21.130 That's it for me, like the biggest, biggest like vain in BCII. 0:01:21.130,0:01:24.430 Second most would be, I think, forward thinking. 0:01:24.430,0:01:28.060 I don't know if that's gonna be allowed as one word or two. 0:01:28.060,0:01:32.869 But basically, I think all the ideas that I see my peers coming up with always feel 0:01:32.869,0:01:35.060 like they're ahead of the time, like, what's it going to be in the future? 0:01:35.060,0:01:38.299 Like, how are we going to innovate here or iterate on this. 0:01:38.299,0:01:42.770 So forward thinking is a big thing and definitely the pedagogical on serendipitous, which is 0:01:42.770,0:01:47.079 a term used throughout BCII and I think there are like a lot of lovely little opportunities 0:01:47.079,0:01:49.570 that you run into throughout the degree. 0:01:49.570,0:01:55.159 So for me, collaborative, forward thinking and serendipitous. 0:01:55.159,0:02:03.680 I absolutely found BCII complimented my core degree, even after the first, the very first 0:02:03.680,0:02:06.680 winter school that I partook in. 0:02:06.680,0:02:11.790 So I found, I guess like mapping the course of my two degrees, I really found like I would 0:02:11.790,0:02:16.770 learn these technical skill sets in product design, which was fantastic, can't speak highly 0:02:16.770,0:02:18.110 enough for that degree as well. 0:02:18.110,0:02:21.620 But then I would kind of go and partake in the BCII school. 0:02:21.620,0:02:23.680 And I would come back with these kind of like new perspectives. 0:02:23.680,0:02:27.810 And I really found that as I was going through projects, particularly in the later years 0:02:27.810,0:02:32.580 of product design, I was able to apply these different perspectives, these different worldviews 0:02:32.580,0:02:36.050 and these different kind of workflows and ways of approaching problems just through 0:02:36.050,0:02:41.130 like the sheer of osmosis of hanging out with all these other super switched on kids that 0:02:41.130,0:02:44.110 were doing their own things in BCII and being able to bring back some of those learnings 0:02:44.110,0:02:45.900 and workflows into product design. 0:02:45.900,0:02:46.900 I thought that was really nice. 0:02:46.900,0:02:48.140 Joel Meredith 2:47 kind of elevated. 0:02:48.140,0:02:50.470 I think it elevates like your technical skill set. 0:02:50.470,0:02:54.810 Because Product Design gives you the skills to build things, and then BCII helped you 0:02:54.810,0:02:57.100 apply those products to the real world. 0:02:57.100,0:03:01.160 So I think for me, BCII was like the biggest bridge between what I technically learned 0:03:01.160,0:03:06.310 in product design and the real world, I think if I hadn't have partaken in BCII, I might 0:03:06.310,0:03:11.460 have, you know, still gotten like the technical skillsets to get a design job, but I might 0:03:11.460,0:03:15.350 not have necessarily understood as clearly like, the role I was playing as a designer 0:03:15.350,0:03:20.550 in the real world, and how my products, like influence the things around me and I think 0:03:20.550,0:03:25.890 that's a really fundamental shift that I can definitely attribute towards BCII. 0:03:25.890,0:03:32.670 Joel Meredith 3:30 Particularly for product design, it's important 0:03:32.670,0:03:36.970 to learn transdisciplinary skills, because so often we find product designers playing 0:03:36.970,0:03:39.230 the role of stakeholder manager. 0:03:39.230,0:03:43.480 So for me transdisciplinary skills at their core are being able to communicate with people 0:03:43.480,0:03:48.030 from different backgrounds, different mindsets and different worldviews and bring them together 0:03:48.030,0:03:52.760 and organise them in a way which promotes like the maximum innovation and output or 0:03:52.760,0:03:54.450 whatever that project might be. 0:03:54.450,0:04:00.180 And my belief is that I think, like true innovation and real innovation, this gets generated from 0:04:00.180,0:04:04.940 The relationship between two people, I think you can come up with X amount of innovation 0:04:04.940,0:04:06.000 by yourself. 0:04:06.000,0:04:09.710 And then, you know, just by adding one more person to the team, you can come up with 10 0:04:09.710,0:04:10.710 x innovation. 0:04:10.710,0:04:15.660 And we'll always get generated from the blurred lines between those two people in that relationship. 0:04:15.660,0:04:19.150 So I think the better you are at communicating with other people understanding where people 0:04:19.150,0:04:24.710 are coming from, and having a grasp on these transdisciplinary style skills, I think you 0:04:24.710,0:04:28.069 can generate more innovation in your team. 0:04:28.069,0:04:35.681 Joel Meredith 4:33 I think the most rewarding project that I 0:04:35.681,0:04:40.900 worked on was, most recently we did our industry innovation project, which is where you and 0:04:40.900,0:04:45.949 a team of students partner up with a real company and they kind of bring a challenge 0:04:45.949,0:04:50.469 or issue that they're working on real time and you help collaborate and iterate that 0:04:50.469,0:04:51.469 with them. 0:04:51.469,0:04:56.389 So we're working with a company called Live education, who are responsible for you know, 0:04:56.389,0:04:58.180 a bunch of life education in Australia. 0:04:58.180,0:05:02.000 And you know, we developed something Initiative's for them and then to see them, you know, kind 0:05:02.000,0:05:07.020 of like, respond positively to those initiatives and try and take them forward in the real 0:05:07.020,0:05:10.810 world I think was positive because I felt like in my core degree, at least while you 0:05:10.810,0:05:15.490 design a lot of things, and make a lot of products, often it kind of ends there at the 0:05:15.490,0:05:20.300 end of the subject, which is, you know, normal and expected but to actually take a BCII subject, 0:05:20.300,0:05:24.650 perform work with a bunch of students, put it out into the world and then see it kind 0:05:24.650,0:05:29.479 of play out in real time and actually see a real company benefit from it. 0:05:29.479,0:05:33.610 I think that was like really rewarding and a really nice stepping stone into like the 0:05:33.610,0:05:35.889 workforce afterwards. 0:05:35.889,0:05:43.180 Joel Meredith 5:41 So now I'm completing I'm halfway through 0:05:43.180,0:05:46.080 my final year of BCII. 0:05:46.080,0:05:53.980 I'm also working in my spare time so I work for a company doing it's kind of like, it's 0:05:53.980,0:05:55.949 half way between product design and BCII. 0:05:55.949,0:05:59.969 So developing design systems and try to collaborate between different stakeholders, giving them 0:05:59.969,0:06:02.919 the design tools that they need to prototype faster. 0:06:02.919,0:06:08.849 And I'm also working for a startup as we're working out of UTS startups as well. 0:06:08.849,0:06:12.310 So it's been really nice seeing kind of like the corporate and startup side, and how BCII 0:06:12.310,0:06:15.909 can relate to both of those. 0:06:15.909,0:06:22.120 Joel Meredith 6:19 In my opinion,BCII, like definitely provided 0:06:22.120,0:06:25.360 me with skill sets that increase employability a lot. 0:06:25.360,0:06:30.189 I noticed like in all the internships I worked across my degree, and then the roles that 0:06:30.189,0:06:35.729 I'm in now, I think, in like, particularly in the interview process, people will try 0:06:35.729,0:06:40.860 and ask you questions to test like, how you think and how you approach problems is a really 0:06:40.860,0:06:46.090 common in you know, like, most roles, but particularly product design ones, as well. 0:06:46.090,0:06:50.249 And, I think I always felt like very comfortable answering those questions, because in BCII 0:06:50.249,0:06:51.990 I am so used to trying to think about things outside the box. 0:06:51.990,0:06:56.289 You're trying to think about how you can solve things in a variety of different ways and 0:06:56.289,0:07:00.680 you think about how you can leverage stakeholders or other team members and I think when an 0:07:00.680,0:07:04.889 employer sees that you are like a more employable person, I think it's like a really important 0:07:04.889,0:07:09.949 soft skill that you know comes straight out of BCII and luckily applies to a tonne of 0:07:09.949,0:07:12.110 different industries. 0:07:12.110,0:07:19.449 Joel Meredith 7:16 I would recommend anybody looking, for me, 0:07:19.449,0:07:24.731 maybe most likely got a bias that I found product designers just like crushed it in 0:07:24.731,0:07:29.779 BCII like excelled really well, because you know, the basis of product design at UTS is 0:07:29.779,0:07:32.160 like design thinking design methodologies. 0:07:32.160,0:07:35.729 And the basis of BCII is like design thinking and a lot of design methodologies. 0:07:35.729,0:07:38.379 So I found like product designers happened to do really well in BCII. 0:07:38.379,0:07:43.160 And most importantly, product designers always came back into product design with a bunch 0:07:43.160,0:07:48.469 of really applicable skills that they could use like very tangibly on their products with 0:07:48.469,0:07:49.469 their teams. 0:07:49.469,0:07:54.759 So not only do you get the kind of like technical like design thinking skills, like how to approach 0:07:54.759,0:07:57.919 problems, how to organise teams, like agile methodologies, lean startup methodologies, 0:07:57.919,0:08:02.689 you also get this kind of like more conceptual world view on how product designers play a 0:08:02.689,0:08:05.430 role in teams and how product designers play a role in the real world. 0:08:05.430,0:08:12.129 And I found looking at my peers and colleagues that took the double degree path and didn't 0:08:12.129,0:08:18.530 I did find on average, the students doing the double degree appeared to do better in 0:08:18.530,0:08:21.540 their final years of their product design, because of these views and technical skill 0:08:21.540,0:08:22.919 sets they could bring to the table as well. Interested in combining your Science degree with the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation (BCII)? Hear from UTS student Clancy Beckers on how the BCII has added value to his Science degree at UTS. 0:00:10.050,0:00:16.360 My name is Clancy, I do a Bachelor of Science majoring in chemistry combined with Bachelor 0:00:16.360,0:00:18.790 of creative intelligence and innovation. 0:00:18.790,0:00:22.450 I have grown up my whole life on the Central Coast. 0:00:22.450,0:00:27.910 So I commute to uni by the train, which is kind of exciting sometimes. 0:00:27.910,0:00:36.550 I decided to pursue creative intelligence and science. 0:00:36.550,0:00:44.610 Mainly, when I was in high school, I would speak to my career's advisor, and I would 0:00:44.610,0:00:49.690 say, I like science, but I don't really want to be a scientist. 0:00:49.690,0:00:51.960 I don't know what I want to do. 0:00:51.960,0:00:57.030 Whether I go to uni or whether I go to tafe, or whether I work. 0:00:57.030,0:01:02.220 And I said that I liked doing art, I love listening to music and I love just doing lots 0:01:02.220,0:01:03.590 of different stuff. 0:01:03.590,0:01:08.550 So my careers advisor basically just said, if you don't really know exactly what you 0:01:08.550,0:01:16.110 want to do, then combine something that you enjoy doing with this degree - BCII. 0:01:16.110,0:01:17.410 And I was like, what is BCII? 0:01:17.410,0:01:20.310 And she was like, honestly, I'm not sure. 0:01:20.310,0:01:21.830 But previous students have liked it. 0:01:21.830,0:01:23.970 So maybe you'll like it to. 0:01:23.970,0:01:25.770 And I gave it a shot. 0:01:25.770,0:01:27.470 I was very nervous going in. 0:01:27.470,0:01:32.470 But in the first school on the first day, I fell in love practically straightaway. 0:01:32.470,0:01:41.180 Well, first off, I tell people, I'm studying chemistry at university and they are like 0:01:41.180,0:01:42.180 - oh yeh chemistry. 0:01:42.180,0:01:47.070 And then I say I'm also studying BCII, creative intelligence and innovation. 0:01:47.070,0:01:51.380 And immediately people say, what, what is the b? 0:01:51.380,0:01:52.380 b? 0:01:52.380,0:01:53.380 What? 0:01:53.380,0:01:54.380 What is creative intelligence and innovation. 0:01:54.380,0:01:57.170 People think maybe it's about AI or robots or something. 0:01:57.170,0:01:59.970 But I say it's about creative problem solving. 0:01:59.970,0:02:07.230 It's about finding your inner creativity, I suppose. 0:02:07.230,0:02:16.610 So BCII for me, is very much about developing myself into a person who can be fluid in any 0:02:16.610,0:02:20.030 sort of environment and not just a work environment. 0:02:20.030,0:02:24.530 It's teaching me how to be fluid in everyday life as well. 0:02:24.530,0:02:31.530 So how I can overcome challenges in a creative way, and use those challenges to create something 0:02:31.530,0:02:39.320 new and innovate it into a learning opportunity. 0:02:39.320,0:02:46.480 The Bachelor of creative intelligence in innovation complements my chemistry degree, mainly by 0:02:46.480,0:02:51.650 letting me see chemistry and other aspects of science in a different light. 0:02:51.650,0:02:58.520 Not just from the perspective of research and not just from the perspective of exploring 0:02:58.520,0:03:00.540 the world around you. 0:03:00.540,0:03:10.790 But it allows me to kind of bring in different fields of education and imagination as well, 0:03:10.790,0:03:12.130 when it comes to my studies. 0:03:12.130,0:03:16.740 So, when I'm learning about organic chemistry, for example, I'm not just thinking about all 0:03:16.740,0:03:21.180 the processes that you have to learn and all the synthesis that you have to learn. 0:03:21.180,0:03:26.450 But I'm thinking about how can I use these and what other aspects of my life and other 0:03:26.450,0:03:38.350 people's lives will this impact with using the knowledge that I've learned. 0:03:38.350,0:03:49.599 In the laboratory, when doing synthesis of drugs, for example, and different compounds, 0:03:49.599,0:03:55.500 you have to be very efficient, and you have to work really, really well with the equipment 0:03:55.500,0:03:58.850 and also with your team partner as well. 0:03:58.850,0:04:03.670 And we figured out a way to kind of streamline the processes. 0:04:03.670,0:04:12.720 And it was a bit like just making a recipe I suppose, but seeing it from a different 0:04:12.720,0:04:18.620 light, so instead of seeing it as doing an organic synthesis, we saw it as kind of a 0:04:18.620,0:04:20.180 game I suppose. 0:04:20.180,0:04:25.820 So we turned it into like, how fast can we do this using this different technique? 0:04:25.820,0:04:32.499 And we figured out that we could do the synthesis in a slightly different way to make it faster 0:04:32.499,0:04:40.460 and we could use less materials and we got to leave the lab an hour earlier I suppose. 0:04:40.460,0:04:48.439 And plus we got to really enjoy, yeah. 0:04:48.439,0:04:58.110 My favourite project in BCII would have to be, there is a subject called past, present 0:04:58.110,0:05:00.759 and future of innovation. 0:05:00.759,0:05:10.050 And you learn about the conditions involved, which facilitate creativity and innovation 0:05:10.050,0:05:12.919 in individuals, but in groups as well. 0:05:12.919,0:05:19.469 And we had to look into a specific creative intelligence hero that we had. 0:05:19.469,0:05:22.969 And I realised I didn't really have a creative intelligence hero. 0:05:22.969,0:05:23.969 And they had to be from our own discipline. 0:05:23.969,0:05:30.360 And I was thinking, creative scientists who innovate, immediately, I was like, oh, Elon 0:05:30.360,0:05:31.360 Musk. 0:05:31.360,0:05:32.960 And I was like, oh, but everyone does Elon Musk. 0:05:32.960,0:05:40.089 So it got me to really, really explore the path that I want to follow after university 0:05:40.089,0:05:46.419 and look at the leaders in that field and how they use creativity. 0:05:46.419,0:05:52.749 And I started to realise that practically all people who are leaders in the scientific 0:05:52.749,0:05:57.120 field are relatively creative and innovative as well. 0:05:57.120,0:06:00.440 And it made me very optimistic for the future, I suppose. 0:06:00.440,0:06:06.400 So that school was very transformative for me because during the school, I kind of had 0:06:06.400,0:06:14.009 this uplifting experience of like, I can be very creative in science, very innovative 0:06:14.009,0:06:20.300 in science. 0:06:20.300,0:06:24.919 In the name BCII, its creative intelligence and innovation. 0:06:24.919,0:06:28.909 So people are immediately drawn towards it. 0:06:28.909,0:06:35.250 One because it has a pretty fancy name, but because they see the word, creative, or innovation, 0:06:35.250,0:06:37.710 and they think, I'm a creative person. 0:06:37.710,0:06:41.559 I would like to follow some sort of creative future. 0:06:41.559,0:06:45.669 I'd be a creative person or be a innovator. 0:06:45.669,0:06:50.270 And there's other people that see it, and they see the word creative and they think 0:06:50.270,0:06:52.339 I'm not a creative person. 0:06:52.339,0:06:53.669 I don't do art. 0:06:53.669,0:06:55.309 I don't like music. 0:06:55.309,0:07:01.940 I don't have really existential thoughts or something. 0:07:01.940,0:07:06.469 But BCII isn't necessarily for creative people. 0:07:06.469,0:07:09.550 And it's not for innovators as well. 0:07:09.550,0:07:11.330 It is for everybody. 0:07:11.330,0:07:20.740 And it doesn't require a predisposition to being creative, but it does require effort, 0:07:20.740,0:07:22.860 I suppose. 0:07:22.860,0:07:30.089 And it has to require some sort of motive to be able to create and also to create change 0:07:30.089,0:07:34.669 as well and to grow. 0:07:34.669,0:07:44.879 You walk into the first day of BCII school, no matter what school it is, and immediately 0:07:44.879,0:07:51.240 you're immersed in this environment, which just uplifts you and allows you to kind of 0:07:51.240,0:07:54.520 explore your own inner potential. 0:07:54.520,0:08:05.259 And make you realise that the path that you may be expected to go on isn't the path that 0:08:05.259,0:08:06.509 you have to take. 0:08:06.509,0:08:10.839 And you get to create your own future, really. 0:08:10.839,0:08:17.099 So it's allowed me to create my own future in science. 0:08:17.099,0:08:21.740 Instead of thinking about just research or just working in industry, it's allowed me 0:08:21.740,0:08:28.809 to think about how I can explore different opportunities, maybe create a startup, explore 0:08:28.809,0:08:33.310 completely different fields of science or fields of science that don't necessarily really 0:08:33.310,0:08:41.780 exist yet because they will exist in the future, but we're not quite there yet. 0:08:41.780,0:08:47.670 And maybe I can get a heads up on it and become a leader in the field before the field even 0:08:47.670,0:08:48.399 exists, I suppose. Interested in combining your Law degree with the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation (BCII)? Hear from UTS student Megha Kapoor on how the BCII has added value to her Law degree at UTS. 0:00:10.050,0:00:11.950 My name is Megha. 0:00:11.950,0:00:17.770 I'm in my third year of studying a combined Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of creative 0:00:17.770,0:00:25.480 intelligence and innovation. 0:00:25.480,0:00:31.170 My background and sort of what school I went to like based in Western Sydney, so I was 0:00:31.170,0:00:32.940 like born and raised there. 0:00:32.940,0:00:39.060 I went to Penrith selective High School, in terms of what subjects I enjoyed and what 0:00:39.060,0:00:40.239 I liked. 0:00:40.239,0:00:43.690 I personally wasn't a big fan of science and maths. 0:00:43.690,0:00:45.890 I was really interested in the humanity side. 0:00:45.890,0:00:51.160 So I studied a lot of history, I did both ancient and modern history, I did society 0:00:51.160,0:00:53.949 and culture and legal studies. 0:00:53.949,0:01:07.490 Personally, I really enjoyed Legal Studies and that's what led me to pursue law in University. 0:01:07.490,0:01:12.270 To be completely honest, I actually hadn't decided what I was going to study with my 0:01:12.270,0:01:15.390 law degree up until the really last minute. 0:01:15.390,0:01:17.830 So that was like options day. 0:01:17.830,0:01:24.410 And I was going around to the different booths at the stalls. 0:01:24.410,0:01:31.270 And I had received a really convincing elevator pitch from the BCII stall. 0:01:31.270,0:01:37.600 And as I was going through the pitch, and I was as I was listening, I realised that 0:01:37.600,0:01:40.320 this degree is so different. 0:01:40.320,0:01:46.890 And looking back I thought to myself, I was like, it's so wonderfully wacky that I'd be 0:01:46.890,0:01:51.390 doing myself a disadvantage for not choosing it. 0:01:51.390,0:01:56.140 And at the end of the day, the driving factor for me to choose it was the fact that I wanted 0:01:56.140,0:01:57.380 to stand out. 0:01:57.380,0:02:02.730 I wanted to be different from all the 10s of Thousands of law students that are graduating 0:02:02.730,0:02:05.020 across the state. 0:02:05.020,0:02:10.610 And I knew the technical skills would make me ready to enter the workforce. 0:02:10.610,0:02:14.670 I would get that from my law degree, but it was the soft skills that I wanted to improve 0:02:14.670,0:02:16.700 on, I wanted to develop. 0:02:16.700,0:02:23.750 And BCII really would make that happen for me, like its entire degree based in collaboration, 0:02:23.750,0:02:32.600 problem solving, and BCII in itself really embodied that for me. 0:02:32.600,0:02:45.110 Words I would describe BCII with are - re-imaginative, transformative and one specific BCII word 0:02:45.110,0:02:53.640 is - chaordic. 0:02:53.640,0:02:55.430 It's improved my confidence. 0:02:55.430,0:03:03.100 So that constant collaboration, teamwork and liaising with a bunch of people from different 0:03:03.100,0:03:09.350 disciplines, has really given me the ability to voice my opinions and engage in feedback. 0:03:09.350,0:03:15.150 And I've been able to take that same confidence and apply it in a law degree setting. 0:03:15.150,0:03:21.040 So that would be, you know, feeling confident to articulate my ideas and class discussions, 0:03:21.040,0:03:29.350 participating in law competitions from mooting to client interview and negotiation. 0:03:29.350,0:03:41.860 BCII has really given me those soft skills to really believe in myself and my self confidence. 0:03:41.860,0:03:47.959 BCII has made me think differently about my core degree is especially relevant in terms 0:03:47.959,0:03:51.840 of the extra curricula I do throughout my law degree. 0:03:51.840,0:03:58.380 So that would be the various competitions such as mooting, witness examination, and 0:03:58.380,0:04:05.360 in those situations, it's really integral to think different to think in a way that 0:04:05.360,0:04:10.810 your opponent wouldn't think about, you know, have a range of different arguments that take 0:04:10.810,0:04:13.170 different perspectives. 0:04:13.170,0:04:20.239 And what BCII taught me is those skills essentially, you know, we're not thinking inside the box, 0:04:20.239,0:04:25.170 it's really taking all your assumptions that you know about that specific problem or your 0:04:25.170,0:04:30.620 client, putting a little box stepping outside of it, and just viewing it from that perspective. 0:04:30.620,0:04:35.879 And it really gives you an advantage when you know your opponent is really is only doing 0:04:35.879,0:04:38.539 a law degree and they've really been trained in a specific way. 0:04:38.539,0:04:48.430 And this BCII allows me to provide a different perspective to you know, I guess client briefs. 0:04:48.430,0:04:58.740 Why I think it's important to learn transdisciplinary skills in my area. 0:04:58.740,0:05:05.039 So essentially transdisciplinary is actually referring to a different range of disciplines 0:05:05.039,0:05:11.039 or faculties all working together in one group or in one faculty. 0:05:11.039,0:05:16.680 So I had, for example, in a group assignment for BCII, I'd be working with students from 0:05:16.680,0:05:24.689 IT, from business, from health, from engineering, and you know, it's a whole range of different 0:05:24.689,0:05:29.409 perspectives in one group and you're working on an assignment together. 0:05:29.409,0:05:36.479 And so the skills that I've learnt from that area and applying it into my law degree, has 0:05:36.479,0:05:43.300 been really, really important for making me future ready for when I enter the workforce. 0:05:43.300,0:05:49.020 So, lawyers don't always work with lawyers and you know, you'll be liaising with a bunch 0:05:49.020,0:05:53.580 of clients with a bunch of different people from different perspectives from different 0:05:53.580,0:06:01.809 backgrounds and to be able to articulate what you want in a way that they will understand 0:06:01.809,0:06:07.849 is like important and it's so needed in the industry at the moment. 0:06:07.849,0:06:13.479 Even perspectives of innovation, legal, the legal industry is constantly evolving, constantly 0:06:13.479,0:06:20.409 changing and legal tech is an example of something that's new, newly emerging and the perspectives 0:06:20.409,0:06:25.279 and the things that we learned throughout BCII especially in terms of creating change 0:06:25.279,0:06:31.370 and driving innovation is something that really gives you an advantage when you're going out 0:06:31.370,0:06:37.059 there and looking for a job and, you know, attending interviews, you have something different, 0:06:37.059,0:06:46.479 something to talk about that other students don't. 0:06:46.479,0:06:53.189 The most rewarding aspects of my studies overall, specifically in relation to BCII has been 0:06:53.189,0:06:57.249 able to work consistently with industry partners. 0:06:57.249,0:07:05.460 So throughout each school or most schools actually, we've always had an assignment briefed 0:07:05.460,0:07:07.430 by an industry partner. 0:07:07.430,0:07:13.710 So for example, in my first year, first subject, it was, City of Sydney, they gave us a problem 0:07:13.710,0:07:19.219 and in our second week, we had to work together in groups and find a solution. 0:07:19.219,0:07:21.240 In my second year, it was MasterCard. 0:07:21.240,0:07:23.139 In my third year, it's PwC. 0:07:23.139,0:07:32.099 So, like such high profile industry partners and really providing solutions to their problems 0:07:32.099,0:07:33.240 is really cool. 0:07:33.240,0:07:35.339 And it's super fun. 0:07:35.339,0:07:41.340 And I guess it really sets you apart from different from other students. 0:07:41.340,0:07:49.430 And the fact that it's all done through like a think tank simulation or a hackathon. 0:07:49.430,0:07:53.990 I find it rewarding that it's quite different from traditional forms of learning. 0:07:53.990,0:07:59.429 So I'm really excited every time I come into BCII school because I've just been doing lectures 0:07:59.429,0:08:04.960 and tutorials in my law degree, and I get to try something new and immerse myself in 0:08:04.960,0:08:15.789 a new style of learning and I find that really really fun and really rewarding. 0:08:15.789,0:08:21.499 So doing a combined degree with Law and BCII is in itself already giving me a competitive 0:08:21.499,0:08:22.749 edge. 0:08:22.749,0:08:30.499 BCII is such an invaluable degree in itself, because of things that you learn about, already 0:08:30.499,0:08:36.550 make you different, it already makes you stand out from the thousands of other graduates 0:08:36.550,0:08:41.349 who you know are just doing normal things like business or comms or, you know, this 0:08:41.349,0:08:51.310 traditional forms of learning and with law to combine this innovative, this really creative 0:08:51.310,0:08:54.279 form of learning, it really sets you apart. 0:08:54.279,0:09:02.509 It gives you a competitive edge in your, you know, interviews or in your recruitment process. 0:09:02.509,0:09:08.960 Specifically the industry partners that you're constantly working with, the hackathon simulation 0:09:08.960,0:09:10.470 style learning. 0:09:10.470,0:09:16.430 It's super, super practical, super future focused and it really makes you like adaptive, 0:09:16.430,0:09:22.579 it makes you agile for the workplace of the future, which is, especially in law constantly 0:09:22.579,0:09:27.560 evolving, constantly changing, especially with things like automation and AI coming 0:09:27.560,0:09:35.649 into the field as well. 0:09:35.649,0:09:40.300 It's definitely challenging, it really stretches you and pushes you to your limits. 0:09:40.300,0:09:45.130 And sometimes I think, gosh, I really want a break right now, like I could do with a 0:09:45.130,0:09:46.130 month long break. 0:09:46.130,0:09:51.990 But, you know, at the end of the day, I look back and I think, Wow, I've grown so much 0:09:51.990,0:09:55.769 in the past, like two and a half years. 0:09:55.769,0:09:58.259 And it's not even just as a person but as a student. 0:09:58.259,0:10:04.940 My learning has changed and grown so much and I honestly couldn't have done that without 0:10:04.940,0:10:05.690 BCII. Interested in combining your Health degree with the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation (BCII)? Hear from recent graduate Chelsea Baker on how the BCII has added value to her Midwifery degree at UTS. 0:00:10.130,0:00:15.130 So I took some time away from uni to have a good think about what I actually wanted 0:00:15.130,0:00:22.820 to get out of studying at University and within about six months I settled on midwifery, I 0:00:22.820,0:00:30.700 expected that it would be a really nice balance of challenge, but also something that I could 0:00:30.700,0:00:35.510 really become invested in and care about day to day. 0:00:35.510,0:00:40.180 And so I looked at studying midwifery at UTS. 0:00:40.180,0:00:49.110 I applied for BCII, as well as Midwifery is fairly simple. 0:00:49.110,0:00:50.960 It was the name that grabbed me. 0:00:50.960,0:00:56.830 So I'd always been really creative and innovation interested me a lot. 0:00:56.830,0:01:02.670 So when I saw that it was offered as a course at UTS, I thought, why not apply? 0:01:02.670,0:01:05.070 And I didn't know that much about it. 0:01:05.070,0:01:07.409 It was a really new course at the time. 0:01:07.409,0:01:12.890 I think my year group was only the third year to be offered the course. 0:01:12.890,0:01:19.780 And so I didn't really know what to expect but I was interested in enough in it to give 0:01:19.780,0:01:26.890 it a go. 0:01:26.890,0:01:33.679 So during my BCII studies, we learned about a concept called T shaped knowledge, which 0:01:33.679,0:01:41.630 is essentially like a capital T. And that's the way that I can best describe how BCII 0:01:41.630,0:01:43.829 and my midwifery studies linked together. 0:01:43.829,0:01:49.340 So studying midwifery taught me how to become an expert in a really specific area. 0:01:49.340,0:01:56.399 So that really deep vertical part of the T type of knowledge and in BCII, I learned a 0:01:56.399,0:02:03.810 lot more of that broad, less expert but wider ranging knowledge. 0:02:03.810,0:02:13.450 And through BCII, I learned that you have the ability and the licence to apply knowledge 0:02:13.450,0:02:22.340 that you may not be an expert in your area of expertise. 0:02:22.340,0:02:30.460 I guess like if I'm talking about like a design domain, so learning about principles of systems 0:02:30.460,0:02:39.000 design and being able to see the health system through that lens has given me a really different 0:02:39.000,0:02:43.350 perspective of what it means to be a midwife within that system. 0:02:43.350,0:02:46.330 And the part that I play in the bigger picture. 0:02:46.330,0:02:54.040 I think, for me, that has been the biggest value that I've gained from BCII. 0:02:54.040,0:03:03.080 It's not so much that it impacts my clinical practice on a day to day level, but it's changed 0:03:03.080,0:03:13.900 my perspective of what my role is and the potential that I have in that greater system 0:03:13.900,0:03:21.540 as I move through my career. 0:03:21.540,0:03:29.540 So if I'm thinking about my favourite experiences, in doing BCII, I would definitely have to 0:03:29.540,0:03:36.370 highlight my honours project, my honours research project that I did in fourth year. 0:03:36.370,0:03:43.090 I always had in mind to go into research, it was something that I really wanted to do 0:03:43.090,0:03:45.150 in midwifery. 0:03:45.150,0:03:53.040 And when I learned that BCII was offering a research honours project, in my final year, 0:03:53.040,0:03:55.570 I jumped on it straight away. 0:03:55.570,0:04:03.210 I think the biggest difference in doing my project under the Faculty of Transdisciplinary 0:04:03.210,0:04:11.950 Innovation as opposed to under the midwifery faculty is that it allowed me to explore areas 0:04:11.950,0:04:17.430 that I wouldn't have necessarily had the ability to explore in midwifery. 0:04:17.430,0:04:25.880 So my project looked at, and i guess compared in a way, women's experience in labour and 0:04:25.880,0:04:33.000 birth with peak mystical experiences that people experience outside of that context. 0:04:33.000,0:04:41.660 And it's, I guess quite a creative and left of field piece of research that I don't think 0:04:41.660,0:04:52.620 that I would have had the ability to look at under a health specific faculty. 0:04:52.620,0:05:01.150 I think it's really important to learn transdisciplinary skills in relation to health because I think 0:05:01.150,0:05:04.139 health is kind of like our foundation. 0:05:04.139,0:05:08.980 It underpins almost everything else that we do in life, whether that's on an individual 0:05:08.980,0:05:17.320 level or as a community, if our health is off our life and our society really struggles. 0:05:17.320,0:05:25.260 So I think it's important to have an understanding of the relationship that health has to all 0:05:25.260,0:05:31.810 these other sectors in our society, and on an individual level as well. 0:05:31.810,0:05:38.900 And I think that having the opportunity to actually work with people who are becoming 0:05:38.900,0:05:44.040 experts in these different sectors as you do when you do collaborative projects with 0:05:44.040,0:05:52.730 your peers in BCII gives you a different appreciation for the value that those sectors bring individually 0:05:52.730,0:06:00.050 and also how they can bring value to your profession and vice versa, that you develop 0:06:00.050,0:06:05.699 this appreciation for information and knowledge exchange and sharing. 0:06:05.699,0:06:13.220 And it helps you to develop an understanding of the interconnectedness between all the 0:06:13.220,0:06:17.419 different domains. 0:06:17.419,0:06:25.010 Studying midwifery you have a really clear idea of the direction that you're going to 0:06:25.010,0:06:30.060 go, you know that you're going to complete your studies, get a job and work as a midwife. 0:06:30.060,0:06:37.200 Whereas studying midwifery and BCII, I know that that is there for me as a pathway. 0:06:37.200,0:06:45.290 But I can be a midwife, and also be a researcher and work on projects that aren't necessarily 0:06:45.290,0:06:52.150 midwifery specific, and go and also articulate the value of midwifery practice to people 0:06:52.150,0:06:59.020 who work completely in totally different sectors that may have not necessarily encountered 0:06:59.020,0:07:04.490 the concepts that we learn about in midwifery and make them valuable and relevant to a really 0:07:04.490,0:07:06.680 different context. 0:07:06.680,0:07:13.870 And those are skills that I would never have learnt or have in my toolkit if I hadn't done 0:07:13.870,0:07:20.090 the dual degree. 0:07:20.090,0:07:24.580 I can say from experience that although the workload is heavy and it is demanding of your 0:07:24.580,0:07:27.580 time, you do still have time to have a life. 0:07:27.580,0:07:33.570 You can see friends, I went on holidays, almost every semester, even though they were shorter 0:07:33.570,0:07:39.080 than what, you know, someone doing just a core degree would have. 0:07:39.080,0:07:42.620 And I also got opportunities to do things like global studio. 0:07:42.620,0:07:49.610 So at the end of my second year, I went to India with BCII and spent three weeks doing 0:07:49.610,0:07:52.260 a community project there. 0:07:52.260,0:07:57.150 And although it was technically uni work, it allowed me to see a part of the world that 0:07:57.150,0:08:01.919 I wouldn't have had the opportunity to necessarily see otherwise. 0:08:01.919,0:08:07.040 So when you're, you know, considering how you're going to fit it all in, just know that 0:08:07.040,0:08:09.540 there is time to make it work. 0:08:09.540,0:08:21.930 You just have to be clever and committed to your time management. 0:08:21.930,0:08:29.430 The impact that BCII had on me, it changed completely the way that I see the world. 0:08:29.430,0:08:36.520 And it made me evolve as a person in a professional and personal sense. 0:08:36.520,0:08:42.919 The people that you come across, the concepts that you come across, the experiences that 0:08:42.919,0:08:51.390 you have, are, unreal and they they will change you and for the better. Interested in combining your Engineering degree with the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation (BCII)? Hear from UTS student Juliet Hodgson on how the BCII has added value to her Engineering degree at UTS. 0:00:08.740,0:00:10.000 Hi I am Juliet. 0:00:10.000,0:00:13.500 I'm a second year engineering and BCII student. 0:00:13.500,0:00:19.369 I was born in Sydney but I grew up in England. 0:00:19.369,0:00:26.650 Honestly, the reason I took it in the first place was it sounded kind of cool. 0:00:26.650,0:00:28.670 And with engineering doing BCII takes no extra time. 0:00:28.670,0:00:32.250 So it seemed like I was getting two for one, which was a pretty good deal. 0:00:32.250,0:00:35.490 The reason I stayed was so much more. 0:00:35.490,0:00:40.050 I love the social aspects of the degree and the range of the people you meet, the industry 0:00:40.050,0:00:43.860 exposure, but mainly I love solving problems. 0:00:43.860,0:00:48.500 As an engineer, it is our role to create a better world, for the future generations, 0:00:48.500,0:00:57.039 and I think the BCII is really going to help me do that. 0:00:57.039,0:01:03.850 Sometimes the ideas in BCII are quite abstract, and I think it really complements the often 0:01:03.850,0:01:07.790 quite logical thinking that is needed in my engineering degree. 0:01:07.790,0:01:14.600 It's always important to have more than one way to think. 0:01:14.600,0:01:23.719 BCII has given me the ability to think logically, abstractly and critically all at the same 0:01:23.719,0:01:24.719 time. 0:01:24.719,0:01:27.520 And it's been really helpful, especially in group design projects. 0:01:27.520,0:01:33.679 In one of my engineering subjects this year, we had to design something that would help 0:01:33.679,0:01:34.789 with the bushfires. 0:01:34.789,0:01:41.310 And I think BCII allowed me to bring a really different perspective to my group. 0:01:41.310,0:01:47.100 The engineering process is often very linear. 0:01:47.100,0:01:52.630 And while this simplifies a lot of the more complicated work, it can miss out key aspects. 0:01:52.630,0:01:56.249 Curing the symptoms but not the disease, so to speak. 0:01:56.249,0:02:02.380 Transdisciplinary skills help you dig a little deeper and consider all the aspects of the 0:02:02.380,0:02:03.380 problem. 0:02:03.380,0:02:08.850 As the world gets more complicated, so does its problems and it's very hard to actually 0:02:08.850,0:02:11.860 solve them with a linear mindset. 0:02:11.860,0:02:22.690 So there's so many favourite experiences to choose from, from lunches with friends on 0:02:22.690,0:02:28.220 the alumni green to getting to do some work with International Conference Centre Sydney 0:02:28.220,0:02:33.750 based off my first project in Winter School, to satisfaction and group celebration when 0:02:33.750,0:02:38.570 you finally hit that submit button at 11:58pm. 0:02:38.570,0:02:43.690 With that being said, my favourite moment has to come from the experience of being on 0:02:43.690,0:02:48.940 the executive committee with BCII connect, which is our social society. 0:02:48.940,0:02:55.760 Every year during O'week without giving too much away, the first year of BCII students 0:02:55.760,0:02:59.710 do a scavenger hunt and this year, I was tasked with creating it. 0:02:59.710,0:03:07.010 A few weeks ago, someone posted in one of our social Facebook groups that about how 0:03:07.010,0:03:12.440 they felt that doing the scavenger hunt had been so beneficial because despite lockdown, 0:03:12.440,0:03:14.190 they felt like they had friends at Uni. 0:03:14.190,0:03:17.340 And they've been having zoom drinks ever since. 0:03:17.340,0:03:24.430 I don't mean to be dramatic, but it honestly brought a bit of a tear to my eye. 0:03:24.430,0:03:33.230 The most rewarding element of my studies so far hasn't been a single moment. 0:03:33.230,0:03:40.590 It's been, being able to create solutions to real world problems in two days, and just 0:03:40.590,0:03:46.940 the knowledge and affirmation, if I can do that, I definitely have the power to make 0:03:46.940,0:03:51.300 the world a better place. 0:03:51.300,0:03:55.790 Ask yourself what's holding you back? 0:03:55.790,0:04:03.120 Is the reason the lack of holidays because I guarantee you there are still plenty. 0:04:03.120,0:04:08.900 Then you know if all these reasons are just fear, ignore it and jump right in. 0:04:08.900,0:04:19.959 Without being too cheesy, my way of describing the BCII in three words, would be just do 0:04:19.959,0:04:20.220 it!

Thank you so much for joining us for this evening’s webinar, where we will be going through UTS Business School's Bachelor of Accounting coop scholarship program. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation upon whose ancestral lands our city campus now stands. I would also like to pay respect to the elders both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land. I'm also conscious that as a webinar, we're zooming in from all different areas. So I would also like to extend that acknowledgement to the traditional owners of the land that you're zooming in from as well. Now, before we get started, I'd just like to bring to your attention that this session will be recorded. So we won't be using anyone's names when we do q&a. So there's still anonymity there, but just letting you know that it will be recorded. Oops, just jumping ahead there. So this is a very interactive session, we know that you've probably got a lot of questions. If you do have any, we really strongly encourage you to hit the q&a button just at the bottom of your Zoom taskbar. And we will be responding to certain questions during the session. And we will also be chatting through some of them at the end as well. Now, my name is Rachel and I have the pleasure of working in the student recruitment team at UTS. Joining me this evening is Michelle Cook, who's the director of The Bachelor of Accounting program, as well as Bianca Buckman, who is a partner at PwC, who is one of our fantastic sponsor organizations. We're also joined by first-year BAcc students, Bianca and John, third-year student, Ethan, who's currently completing his second internship, and also Georgia who finished the course last year and is now working as a grad at KPMG. In the background is Carin who works with Michelle on the BAcc program, and she'll be answering any questions that come through during the session. And as I mentioned, we'll also be answering questions at the end of the session two. So any questions that you do see come through, you can upvote them. So you know, if there's a question you don't need to ask again, you can just upvote it. And we will respond to that as well. Being a webinar, I know we're in year three of a lot of virtual events. So you're probably well-versed in troubleshooting. But please bear with us. If there are any technical issues, we'll work to resolve them as quickly as possible. If you find you're not able to access the webinar, at any point, usually the old logging out and logging back in again, excuse me, usually resolves such issues. So tonight, we're going to be presenting on the following topics, what the Bachelor of Accounting actually is, what the core structure is, our sponsors, how the internships work, the career options available, the application process, as well as q&a. So, Michelle, thank you so much for joining us. One of the questions we get asked all the time is, what exactly is the Bachelor of Accounting? How is it different to the Bachelor of Business with a major in accounting? Can you give us a bit of an overview on that? Oh, I think you're on mute Michelle. Michelle Cook 03:46 Oh, my gosh, after all this time zoom ever I think I've learned as the words came, I was on mute. So I do apologize. But I just welcome you to this webinar. And I hope that we can answer some of the questions that you might have about the Bachelor of Accounting programZoom. So how is it different from the Bachelor of Business? Well, I started called back as we call it, a Bachelor of Business on steroids, because we do it so much faster than the normal Bachelor of Business. And within the Bachelor of Accounting program, you are required to do an accounting major. And we'll go more into the structure of those things a little bit later. Nothing that really sets it apart from the Bachelor of Business is that you do get to six-month internships, which is full-time with one of our sponsor organizations. And you also get a scholarship of up to about $56,000 Over the three years. So the other major differentiators about the program and also the tight-knit sort of cohort, because there's usually only about 30 to 35 students in the actual intake itself. It says that sort of answer your question, Rachel. Rachel - UTS Business School 04:54 Absolutely. Brianna, I might also throw to you as well because obviously you were sitting where a lot of our attendees were sitting this time last year. So what did you kind of think accounting was when you were wondering what course to choose and what you thought it was turned out to be the reality. 05:15 Look, before I went through the rabbit hole that was researching BAcc, I thought accounting was, you know, the old number crunching, you know, debits, credits and all that. But I've come into the course it's not that at all. You know, you do so much business. So my subjects right now are so far outside of business as well. There's like economics. There's statistics as this sudden other and it's just so broad and saturated. I don't think I could have imagined what it was before actually joined. Rachel - UTS Business School 05:46 When and Georgia, obviously, you're even further on the other side of things as a graduate. Do you want to add anything to what Brianna said as an alum and from you know, your based on your work experience and internships? Georgia - BAcc Student 06:01 Yeah, I can basically echo what Brianna said, I thought accounting would basically be all numbers number crunching, as mentioned by Brianna, really complex mathematics, and truly be super boring as there's a common perception that accounting is very, very boring, sitting at your desk all day, no social life, as well as the people too. But my experiences have been like the polar opposite. The math is very straightforward. Even if you have a basic do basic math, at scope, I was gonna say University, oh my gosh, I'm way past that now. School are more than capable of completing the BAcc. As well as the people I've met within studying accounting. They're not boring people at all. They're very insightful and passionate, such as my lecture as people out in the workforce when I've undertaken my internships. And that's something I really value and have, like, come to learn. It's an amazing career to have. But all in all, I guess, through studying accounting, through studying back at university, I've learned the importance of accounting in business, which really plays to the fact that accounting is the Language of Business. And yeah, it differentiates you from any other business student, which is amazing. Rachel - UTS Business School 07:17 Excellent. Thank you so much, Georgia. Now, the Bachelor of Accounting is a very competitive course. Michelle, we do expect a lot from our backs. What are you looking for from our current students? Oh, I think you're on mute again, Michelle. Michelle Cook 07:41 I'm sorry, we have new systems. And so my webcams Oh, sorry to everyone. So I've been trying to place it so you can see me properly. So I apologize profusely, but we'll get it right. But we do we look for and expect of our students, we expect them to be nice people. We want them to have curiosity, humility. It's not only about taking a position in this program, it's also understanding the privilege you're given to have a life changing moment, and how do we contribute that back into our society. So part of our mission statement is to create future business leaders using accounting as a foundation. But I sort of add on to that, and also with the humility and respect to give back to society, because that's what we sort of stand for at UTS as well. So we do expect a lot, but we give a lot to in order to develop students in so many ways, so that they can become I suppose the best of themselves and the best person they can be. Rachel - UTS Business School 08:37 Absolutely. Now, Jahn, obviously, you know, you're in first year, you've just come off the back of the HSC. How do you find the workload in the program? 08:50 At the moment, look, the workload is it's pretty good, fast track period, which all the students will go through that is lengthy. We're not lengthy at all. It's actually really brief. But there is a big workload in that. And I think it depends how much you sort of do outside of University. I'm myself, I'm at college where there are a lot of other responsibilities. So I do I often find myself having instances where I got I've got a lot to do right now. But as I always say to people, being busy is not a bad thing. I definitely prefer being busy than being bored. So it's definitely manageable to say have a job. I know Brianna works a job outside of uni at the moment. So let's definitely do one first semester, but you probably wouldn't be able to do in second semester as you already be working a full time job, but it's definitely manageable, I'd say. Rachel - UTS Business School 09:39 Excellent. And Michelle, Jahn just mentioned fast track, which a lot of our viewers might be wondering what exactly is fast track. Michelle Cook 09:50 So we start very early in the year. We have to let you know, we start early to allow you to have that six months period in your first day to do internships. So we come straight from the fireworks of Christmas, straight into the third of January. And we start. And they do a thing as a dimension called Fast Track. So first is we'll do two subjects in six weeks. So and you do it in block moto come to me for nine to five every day. And you do a tutorial and a lecture in one in one day itself. And then, of course, you do the various assessments that go with that. But that will then allows them so much time to do that six month internship. And that's why we actually do fast track. So we do fast track in first year, with two subjects and fast track in second year with one subject in that summer period. Rachel - UTS Business School 10:45 Excellent. And Georgia. How do you find looking back on you know, juggling Fast Track juggling internships juggling some semblance of a social life? Do you feel that that helped prepare you for full time work? Georgia - BAcc Student 11:00 Most definitely, I wouldn't trade it for anything. When you're in the moment, you definitely think it's a bit overwhelming, you have to learn what we call is like we've got buckets, we've got a social bucket, we've got like a study bucket, which is where your education goes into, then you have other buckets as well, you've got to learn how to manage your time and put as much water time into the buckets as you wish. And that definitely translates into the workforce. So as Michelle has mentioned, we get to six month internships where you have to study alongside it simultaneously. I would say this definitely helped prepare me for juggling commitments at KPMG. Because I'm also completing my Chartered Accountants. So that study alongside working exactly the same as what we did in Deac. As well as within beer, we're also encouraged to take place in clubs and societies as well. So not only on top of work, then University, then clubs, then you got clubs and societies, that also takes up another portion of your time. So now I look back on it, I definitely wouldn't trade it for anything. I've been able to prioritize my time coming into KPMG. I feel like I have a lot more time up my sleeves. Maybe it's just because studying is not as intense. But yeah, it's, it's great. Rachel - UTS Business School 12:15 Excellent, fantastic. And I love your analogy about the buckets and ensuring that they're all They're all adequately watered. I think that's great advice for a lot of our attendees who are probably feeling a little under the pump with their HSc year. Now, Michelle, obviously, you spoke a little bit about Fast Track and what that is, but would you be able to talk us through exactly how the course works, Michelle Cook 12:41 So as I said, you have to do a major in accounting. So what does a major mean at uni, it means eight subjects a specific to that. area. So in accounting, you would do caught you do eight subjects, you do come in in your first year, you do a general degree. So you touch on each bit, you do a bit of marketing a bit of economics, as Brianna was saying. And it gives you a wide range of interests that you might want to pursue besides the accounting degree, then you do your accounting majors are saying, which is eight subjects. And then what I love about UTS is the flexibility in the choice of what you do after that, you can either choose to do another major, for example, finance, or you can do that. So that's eight subjects, or you can do to specialist subjects in whatever you choose to do, which is amazing, which is four subjects and four subjects. A lot of students that are in their third year, will choose to do a sub major. So do four subjects. And then they finished the other four electives overseas. So we've had people go to I know in this year to Milan, to the US to Switzerland, and then finish their degree overseas. So there it is very broad in what you couldn't do, and also really broad in how you can develop yourself. Because for me, it's about learning. Like you should really try and explore all the different options that you can to become a really holistic and professional person. So that's sort of how we work our majors and sub majors. And as I said, it runs as per the business degree, but we just do have to do a major in accounting. Rachel - UTS Business School 14:23 Exactly. And I think it's important to note as well that you don't need to have a set idea of what you want to do. So there's a lot of options there. And the beauty is that you do get exposed to those different areas of business. So you could very well go in thinking economics is something I definitely want to specialize in and then you know, you might think oh actually marketing is more appealing or I want to pair finance with accounting. Brianna, which kind of boat were you in? Did you come into the course knowing exactly how you wanted to specialize or have you decided yet or whereabouts are you Look when 15:01 I entered the course, I mean, like, you always have some idea floating around, but I wasn't set on a path. And I'm still not set on our path yet. I'm in my first year. So I have a lot of time to decide that especially looking at this internships and getting to experience those, but currently, I'm leaning more towards funds management, sort of the investment area, I'm really excited to get into the internship just to see how you know, life and annuities goes, but ya know, still not sure you don't have to be sure. Michelle is not going to look at you and go she she doesn't know what she wants to do. We're not going to take you like, yeah, a lot of my friends and I we have no idea exactly what we're doing with the rest of our lives. Rachel - UTS Business School 15:45 Excellent. Excellent. And, Jahn, what about yourself? Do you know what you want to specialize in? 15:52 Um, yes, at the moment. So sort of similar to be honest, do very, keeping my options open, I think that's one of the great things about the program is you get exposed to so many different areas. And that will allow you to keep an open mind, you allow yourself to gain so many experiences. So as Briana sort of touched on, we've got our internships coming up. So that'd probably be a really good experience, we can see things that we like and see what we don't like. And then from that, we can sort of gauge as to where we might like to go. But at the moment, I'm in regards to selecting my second major, I've thought about maybe economics, or doing a sub major with something similar to economics and in any business law, because I just remembered in school in the HSC are, obviously business interests me, but also Legal Studies and Economics where I really enjoyed those. So that might be something I'd like to pursue in the future. But it's definitely good to keep an open mind. And if you already have an open mind, that's great, because you can just sort of gauge things as you go, and then decide where you want to go. And you've got a bit of experience. Rachel - UTS Business School 16:50 Excellent, fantastic. And really great advice as well. Georgia, obviously, you've been through the process, what did you choose to major in or do a sub major in? Georgia - BAcc Student 17:01 Yeah, of course. Um, so basically, as mentioned, we have to do a compulsory major in accounting to start off with so one of my majors was accounting. Then in the second half, I actually did a sub major in finance than I need for elective. So it's presented on the right hand, very right hand side of the screen. I chose a sub major in finance, as I've always been very mathematical. I came into the UK actually wanting to do finance. So yeah, I was set on it from the start. A lot of people aren't, though, as Bianna and John said, You got to keep open minded because you go through experiences that shape what you want to do at university. That yeah, I guess I was slightly different. But it's very, very common to be thinking that way. Um, I found in all the subjects within the accounting major and the finance sub major, to be very hands on and practical, which is what I loved on as you're constantly learning, we're constantly learning about huge corporations are learning how to read financial statements, and ultimately provide me with that experience. And that foundation to venture out into any aspect of the corporate world, which I found really important. Then I guess, to top off my degree, I chose some electives, which are the four little individual slots on the right hand side of the screen, just to diversify my knowledge and to really choose subjects I was interested in, but I couldn't encapsulate in one sub major. So I did subjects ranging from management to it. And I think there are a few marketing subjects in there as well. And every subject was super insightful and very, very relevant in the current world. And I can give a brief example, my it subject, I completed during the time that Optus had their massive data breach, and we were actually like security and data at that time. So yeah, it's, it's great having the flexibility of adding on to sub majors are some major and electives as you can really tailor your degree to suit what you want to pursue and what you want to learn. Rachel - UTS Business School 19:00 Excellent. And I think your point as well about the practicality, you know, you're studying financial statements, you were studying case study in real time with Optus, seeing how they responded, seeing how it happened, like yes, in the real time nature is is very apparent. Now, obviously, uni life goes beyond the classroom and, you know, the social component of uni generally, it's really important. Michelle, there's a lot of talk about the BAcc family. I think you might have actually mentioned that earlier as well. And how valuable is that for our students? Can you talk a little bit about the close knit nature of the course. Michelle Cook 19:45 Absolutely. I don't think people really believe me and I think Brianna and the other banks on the call will agree with me say you will your edge mates and the closest friends you've ever had. And and you really do but I think The beauty of it is that we do lots of things, we really try and look after each other. So we have, we've got your back to mentoring program. So we're people are mentored from the year above them. And you're above that. And so we have mentoring trees. And usually we get together once a session with each other, I think, I think the first year, we've had dinners and all sorts of things, and coffee cat jobs with their buddy. And we try and expand that right to the alumni. So that once a year, we get all get together in that tree. So we can try and help each other. And I think that's a really important part of the fabric of back is that we do look after each other. And there's nothing that you need to worry about, because you'll have so much support going through the program. And I think there's the BI Bowl coming up. On next Saturday, I think everyone's very stressed about what they're going to wear. And there's not only they don't only work hard and support each other in that, there's also a fantastic social element. And I think it's really been accentuated because we all found out what it's like not to be connected during COVID. So it's a real hunger, I think, for people to connect with each other, and have all those different as aspects of getting to know one another and have a supportive environment. Rachel - UTS Business School 21:28 Absolutely. Jahn, now, I believe that you're actually from Orange, is that correct? Um, yeah, 21:35 I am. So I had moved to Sydney in fast track. But um, yeah, so did you have like a follow up on that? Perfect. Rachel - UTS Business School 21:44 No, I did. So you know, obviously, did you know anyone, you know, coming into the course, I mean, because you obviously didn't just have a new course and a new university environment, you had a completely new city as well. 21:58 Yeah. So um, fortunately, I have like a lot of family in Sydney, and my brother lived in Sydney. So I moved to one of the Sydney Uni colleges. So they were really great. But, um, it was somewhat of a daunting experience. At first, I knew no one that was in the cohort. I did know some other people that have done the program. That's actually how I heard about it. But within my ego, I didn't know anyone but um, it's quite a daunting experience going on the first day sort of going in, but um, as Michelle and everyone's talked about this, they have family and having great friendships, the any of the like, berries or whatever, everything was broken instantly. And as first year students, you have your first orientation day, then you go into camp, on a farm out near Mittagong through the barrel area. And that is just the biggest icebreaker in itself. That's where a lot of the friendships are made. And it's just a great experience. And then from then on, after the camp, you start the Fast Track period, which is obviously academic stuff, it's really nice to have that period of just getting to know each other. So I'd say yeah, for me, the whole move itself, it's honestly been a breeze, making friends has been a breeze. And it's just been a great time so far. Yeah. Rachel - UTS Business School 23:08 Excellent, fantastic. And Brianna, sometimes we hear that in your 12. You know, obviously, you've got your friendships, you've gone through high school with them. But sometimes it can be quite competitive people keen to get first in advanced English or whatever. Whereas at university, and especially in the Bachelor of Accounting, everyone's quite collegial. Do you find that there's a lot of assistance in the program? You can bounce ideas off each other? 23:38 Yeah, look, it's definitely a lot different from high school. Even in high school, I wasn't very stingy about sharing my notes. But here, it's a whole new level like you wouldn't believe, to a point where like, we might get a bit of disapproval for it. Because we will sit next to each other and do quizzes together, weekly quizzes that come out every Tuesday, there are three of them. And we all just sit together and do them. There's no sort of competition between who will do the best. I mean, there's friendly competition, you know, there's a little bit going on about between two of our BX about who's going to do better, but it's all friendly competition, none of us are gonna go back and give you the wrong answers or stab each other in the backs because we want to do better. It's all very uplifting environment, you're always gonna get help. So for us, we have this big, big group chat with all three of 36 of us. And you can send questions in there any point in the day and someone will help you out. And it's just a very, very welcoming, welcoming environment that just allows you to do really well academically as well. Rachel - UTS Business School 24:44 Excellent, fantastic. And Georgia you mentioned clubs and societies as well. Do you want to chat to us a little bit about some of the clubs and societies you were part of and, and also as an alum, like, do you still keep in touch with A lot of your back cohort. So a bit of a two fold question for you. Yeah, Georgia - BAcc Student 25:05 I'll read the former first. So um, some clubs and societies I was involved in is women in business or they're amazing at like empowering females towards leadership opportunities. And anything in the corporate environment, it's a great space. I was also highly involved, there's probably one extra one that I would say I was most involved in, which was case team case team is a massive thing, especially with BX on there are a lot of bx tend to be involved in case 10, there's an opportunity to travel overseas with the funded by the university, and it's basically a competition where it's a competition, and companies provide a stimulus, and you have to try and solve real life business problems for them. In a short period of time, some of them, you may only have three hours to find the solution for the problem. Some of them can be six hours, some of them could be 24 hours, it completely depends. But that's an amazing, I guess, you'd say it's both a club and a society, because you get to travel with it. Um, but yeah, highly recommend engaging yourself in case team or any other even any other club or society, you're more than welcome to join, and everyone will take you in. And there's such great opportunities. There are also cultural societies, you can join through clubs, dog society, cat society, on the range is so diverse, and it's tailored to every single person. Next part of the question, do I maintain social connections? Yes, I definitely did. And our cohort definitely did. So Brianna mentioned their cohort was is 36 students, we only had 27 in our cohort. So we were very, very closely knit and has still remained in contact, whether I'm texting them, whether we're creating social events together, or even run into them in the city. And that connection never gets lost, which I think is an amazing benefit of the B app program. The fact that the connections don't just exist at university, that beyond University too. And just to add one small thing is that it's not only within your cohort, either, you become really close to the cohorts above the cohorts below you, which I think is also really important, because like I said, I run into people in the city, I'm not just running into people in my cohort, you're running into people who are two years above you or two years below, and you can see them really develop. And it's it's amazing to see. Rachel - UTS Business School 27:27 Excellent, fantastic, thank you for sharing your experience as well. Now, obviously, we wouldn't have the Bachelor of Accounting if it weren't for our sponsors. Now, obviously, a huge part of the way that the sponsors are involved is throughout internships, and we'll be speaking about those in just a little while. But Michelle, how else do our students network with our sponsors? Michelle Cook 27:59 We have so many events that we can form a relationship with both the students and also the sponsors. And the sponsors are just so generous in giving their time. And also trying to develop the next, I suppose future leaders and developing young talent. And so we do things like the first year guest lectures. Amazing. So students will be out of school, high school for a matter of months. And they'll be meeting partners like Bianca from PWC. They'll be meeting CEOs CFOs of some of these companies, which are actually some of the biggest companies in Australia, if not the world. So those are some of the things we also have events where they'll come and students get the opportunity to network right across the board and develop really good skills on relationship building. With the sponsors, we have create career expos, which is only for vx and the sponsors. So a multitude of events where students really get to be, I suppose, in the face of the C suite, which is unknown at a university in the university, even some people in industry or would not have those opportunities. So we are very, very lucky with the generosity as I was saying all have our sponsors and the time they give to develop our fantastic bx. Rachel - UTS Business School 29:16 Well, speaking of the generosity of the time of our sponsors, it's a great segue to throw to Bianca PwC has been such a great supporter of the program, and has been a sponsor for so many years now. What was it that made PwC decide to come on board as a sponsor. 29:39 Thanks, Rachel. And good evening, everyone. As Rachel said, I'm Bianca Buckman a partner at PwC in our Sydney office, working in our financial services assurance team. And you can see here I have my accounting CA certificate in the background as well. So a very great qualification that that I encourage you all to Do, Rachel To be honest, I actually don't know what year we became a sponsor. But it was well before I was involved, so I can't speak for back then. But I can speak for now as to why we continue to sponsor the program. That, I guess the way I think about it is, the quality of the students that come out of this program is in a league of its own, it's exceptional. I have seen a number of our interns and then people who come and come and work with us at as a graduate afterwards, and the quality and like their, their way they think they're very well rounded individuals. They've got the accounting qualification qualification in terms of their major, they've got work experience with them. They just stand out when we're going through graduate programs. So essentially, I've probably seen the majority that come through to PwC. As graduates, they ended up being our top rated performers for the time that they are with the firm. So I did, we just actually had one UTS Co Op alumni become a partner this year. So that was pretty exciting. And I've seen a number of them do other things with their careers as well, which is fantastic. But to me, it's the part of what I love is that Michelle and the team go through such a rigorous process. And it's so competitive in terms of who they accept into the program, that they've done all the hard work for me as a sponsor. So I know that anyone who's in this program is going to be an exceptionally high quality candidate to come into the firm as a graduate. And I love being able to, to know that and rely on that year after a year. Rachel - UTS Business School 32:07 Excellent, fantastic. And yeah, just knowing that you can bank on it is, as you say, a real relief, 32:13 you feel like a lot of the hard work is done for you. Exactly. Rachel - UTS Business School 32:18 So when we talk about internships, because obviously it's such a huge part of the program, both in terms of time experience, and and for the graduates as well actually coming out with that year. But sometimes we find that the word internship conjures images of photocopying, and making coffee and you know, going and fetching, you know, dry cleaning and things like that, which you know, isn't exactly the case. Bianca, would you be able to talk us through some of the kinds of kinds of work that our interns do do at PWC? 32:53 Yeah, absolutely. So when any of your students come and intern with us, we actually treat them, they start with a graduate and trainee cohort that all start at the same time. And frankly, they get treated exactly the same. So they come in, they're not treated like an intern, most people don't even realize that they're an intern, they'll just think they're one of the grads, or trainees starting with us at that time. So when they joined, they will have two weeks of pretty intense training with us to learn the basics around auditing and audit methodology. And then they'll be pretty much straight on client engagements. So straight out with the team, looking after particular areas of the audit. And so looking at, I guess what we sort of think is our foundation level areas of auditing parts of the financial statements of companies. And so they'll be on the job with their teams being coached by their team members to learn and understand how to do the work that they need to do. And then we'll be doing that, that involves talking directly with the client building relationships with the client, learning the technical aspects of audit methodology, learning about audit quality, how to document their work, so I definitely don't send my juniors on coffee runs. So that that doesn't happen. I don't think sometimes they might volunteer, but we all take turns. But it's really you get thrown straight into the thick of the the engagement work that that we all do. So it's some, it can sometimes be a little bit full on and probably overwhelming at the beginning. But you you see them from sort of day one through to six months. And it's amazing watching the journey they go on in terms of how capable they are by the end of the six months and how much they've really learned that's allowed them to put the things that they've been learning at university into practice on a day to day perspective, which is a huge plus for them when they're going out into the world to become a graduate, whether it's with PwC, another sponsor or elsewhere, they already have a year experience working in an accounting field under their belt, which again, sets them apart from the competition as they're working through graduate program recruit recruitment programs. Rachel - UTS Business School 35:25 Excellent, fantastic. And Georgia, obviously, as we've said, you're on the other side of things as a as an alumni now, how did you find the internship process? Especially how, you know, how did you find the tasks different in first year versus in third year? Georgia - BAcc Student 35:44 Yeah, I guess the process in general, just to make it clear, Michelle is very, very good at considering your preferences to where you want to be placed, but also knowing that organization that you'd fit best in. So that also plays Michelle strengths, she has done it for a very, very long time. She knows if you may put in a preference to where you want to get placed, and you may not get your preference. But guess what every single company that sponsors the program, as incredible from start to finish, and you have an amazing experience, based off my experiences, so my first internship was at Coca Cola Amatil, which is now Coco, your Pacific partners, oh, my gosh, that was four years ago, I have to retrace my memory. I was in a finance roles are chief reporting to the Chief Financial Controller. So I was doing accounting work, budgets, on what else SAP everything from that aspect, which is completely different to my second internship, which was with Bianca PWC. I was in order at PWC. So working on the complete opposite side of the accounting aspects rather than producing the numbers. This time, I was trying to verify the numbers. Yeah, which was actually a great experience, I really enjoyed the audit side of things, because I had to be analytical had to really search awareness states could pop up, had to understand the process from start to finish, it wasn't just looking at the financial statements being like, Hmm, that number seems large, let me investigate that, or that number is too small, I'm not going to investigate that. There's more of a procedure to that, which is what I really enjoy. And I'm doing audit at KPMG. Now, which is very, very similar to PwC. And it's definitely where I want to be audit is where I want to be. Yeah, I loved accounting, but I think what it stretches me that tiny bit more, which is something I've always looked for and want to push those boundaries. So yeah, they're incredible. Like I said, I'm not going to point out any sponsors, because they're all incredible. And any single company that you go to, you're going to have an amazing experience with. Rachel - UTS Business School 37:58 Excellent, thank you so much, Bianca. And, again, I just want to touch on as well, the fact that you mentioned that Michelle, actually tailors, you know, takes preferences into account, but also tailors your strengths and skills. So, Michelle, again, that's just evidence of how closely you do work with our students. You know, can you give us a couple of examples of, you know, how you how you're able to match them up, and you know, what you kind of look for? Michelle Cook 38:25 Yes, I will, people are different developmental stages in their lives. And we have to be very aware of that, we have to look at how we can develop them, but also make sure they have a great experience in the corporate world. So when I was sitting in, I was thinking about, thank you very much for the kind words, Georgia that I was thinking about, Oh my gosh, imagine I'm sitting there about to do my HSC. And oh, my gosh, I'll go into a six month internship. The world is actually a very commonplace, and we know how we develop your skills, you're never thrown into the deep end, you always have someone that will help you. And we just try and mimic that. So there are times when you will talk to me, you might you might know what all these companies do. But hopefully I do. I always say the backs you don't know what you don't know, that always open your mind to embracing so many different things. So we do get to know you quite well. Because we see each other a lot. And then we talk about you where you'd like to go where where you where we maybe can develop skills, where that skills in confidence, skills in people management, you know, the whole gamut of the professional world, that and I suppose attributes that we really like to say, and then we try and match that with companies. So some people will be better maybe in the first entrance at a smaller company. Others will be better at a bigger company. It's oh so many So many variables, it's amazing. But it really does all work out. And I think, from the internships you get, get a greater sense of self. And I love when you come to me after those six months, just your growth is just phenomenal, then that just an amazing sort of experience it I think, that is quite unique to back, then we track your growth. And really, we never let you go. So there's no such thing as a back alumni. So Georgia, you're always just to be Rachel - UTS Business School 40:34 fantastic. And just circling back to our sponsors, specifically PWC. I've, I've just been messaged by the lovely Kern who said that PwC have actually been a supporter since 1995. 40:49 Wow. 20 Rachel - UTS Business School 40:51 years. So obviously, well before your time. But again, that's really, really testament to the relationship that PwC has with UTS. And, and I know speaking on behalf of UTS, we are incredibly grateful for all of the experience and all of the support that we've had over those 28. Fantastic. 41:15 It's been a pleasure, we love getting the students. So it's, we always get excited when we have some coming through as graduates. So it's fabulous. Michelle Cook 41:26 And just to mention, too, that at the moment, Biak the Co Op program has the most sponsors in accounting, any company of any co op in Australia, which we're also very, very proud of. Rachel - UTS Business School 41:42 Absolutely. Hence why this year has been a bigger cohort than traditional year. So I know that we've had a question come through that said, for 2024, would we be looking for approximately 30? Students? Michelle, do you want to answer that one? Michelle Cook 41:59 Um, you know, I will? I won't know. I hate to make commitments like that, because you're not sure. But I would hope that, you know, we would be able to maintain the level we have and maybe go a little bit further. Rachel - UTS Business School 42:13 Excellent, fantastic. I'm sorry. Now, we've mentioned that, you know, the course can be diversified depending on your interest. We've mentioned that when you graduate with a Bachelor of Accounting, that doesn't mean that you're going to be changed to a calculator and a bean counter or anything like that. Michelle, what kind of roles can graduates expect to work in? Michelle Cook 42:41 Well, you know, we have a BAcc only LinkedIn page. And it's just amazing. The diversity of careers that you could explore through accounting is absolutely incredible. One of our alumni who's just finished in the role, but he was the CFO, Paramount Pictures in Los Angeles. And I love that, you know, when you watch the movies next time, everyone just have a little look, because he will say credits to accountants. Don't you love that? I love that. I do. I do. Yeah. And every every single organization that you can think of needs accountants, and quite desperately, and I'm sure Bianca will elaborate on that in a moment. But I look at accounting as Swiss, we always call it the Language of Business. But it's actually the Swiss Army knife of industry. Because, you know, there's a Swiss Army knives and all the different components of it as a component for every single business. And you can go from accounting into every other sector, whether that be marketing, etc. But you can't come the other way. Absolutely. And what we're finding more and more is that the skills that all our alumni say that they use every day, no matter what role they eventually take, is accounting skills. That's why That's why they're the CFOs the CEOs, because everyone has to know how money goes in and money comes out. It's such an important language and essential for, I suppose, the continuous running of a nation. Rachel - UTS Business School 44:09 Absolutely, yeah. Absolutely. And so, you Michelle Cook 44:12 know, so if so, it'll be interesting, you know, go on to places like LinkedIn, search accountants, and see what they actually do. It's quite amazing. What do you think, Bianca? 44:25 I completely agree, Michelle. So I actually think of people with accounting degrees as well rounded business people. So you know, I'm an audit partner at PWC. But when people say to me, what do you do? I say, you know, I work with clients to give society trust in their results in financial statements. I help them solve problems, and I work with them on whatever is priority for them. The number of my clients I regularly deal with see suite across ASX 50, through to much smaller clients, the majority of C suite clients have their ca qualifications in terms of their Chartered Accountants. And so to me, it's a ticket to being a well rounded business person, whatever you decide to do. And I think that's the really big selling point around doing an accounting degree and something like BIAC, where you combine that with practical experience. Rachel - UTS Business School 45:34 Excellent, fantastic. Thanks, Bianca. Um, now, obviously, we've spoken a lot about what the Course entails what it's like from, you know, our current students, prospective sponsors, alumni, but for our, you know, people currently tuning in a lot of them are year 12. Michel, how do they actually apply for the course? What are you looking for? Michelle Cook 45:59 Yeah. So how you apply first of all, as you put an online application in, but and the first round is 19th of May. And people say, Why do you have a first round and a second round. And really, some people are going to do a few things maybe before the October close date, which is the 13th of October, and they might want to have that on their CV. But what I say is if your CV and current current and I say if your CV is ready, and you put it in now, because you'll get it before you have the pressures of the HSE. From them, it gets cold. So I look for problem solving, leadership, volunteering experience, we weren't all around people. We're not just looking for, you know, the person who gets the highest scores, but can't speak to someone. Because when we just take a step backwards, when you look at what professional skills you need, it's things like communication, curiosity, problem solving. What is what are your What are your other interests, because we're not just an island of HSC? Thank heavens, we are more than that. And that's what we're looking for. We're looking for great all around people. And I always say, even in the interviews, when you get to interview, and I hope you do, I say I just look for nice people. Just nice people, don't worry about the ATAR. Don't worry, it's not about that. It's about who you are as a human and what you can contribute back to the program, and be what are one of our ambassadors really, because that's what you are beauty is when you go into all the different things you do. So from that period, we go into an interview interviews are from them, I always have to look at the you know, the old age brain, make sure about the right dates from the sixth or the 10th to November, you book him for a session, and then we give you yummy, yummy food. So very important. And you have a group assessment. So that means you have a group of four, we give you a problem to work on together. And we look at how you collaborate, how you work within the team. And then after that, you just go into a brief. And I'm not going to call it an interview, I'm going to call it a conversation. It's a conversation with some people about what you've done, what you're proud of. And where do you see yourself going. And from there, we then go into you might be shortlisted and hopefully get a call from me, after eight hours are released to offer you a position in the program, which is one of my happiest days. Rachel - UTS Business School 48:38 Absolutely. I have seen you on off a day it is one of your favorite days. So again, just we've had a question come through about how to prepare for the interview. But Michelle, I think you answered it, be yourself have that authenticity. Michelle Cook 48:55 Yeah. Absolutely. And, you know, never be scared of an opportunity. So be Act is an opportunity. But I always say to everyone who applies is a really big secret i i learned learned a long time ago, and that's no doesn't hurt. But if you don't give yourself the opportunity to get the chance, then that's when you're letting yourself down. So, you know, apply, try and come to the interviews I say and I think I've said that for a few years now. But it's like wanting to win lotto and not getting a ticket. Yes, like it did you use them again. It's never gonna happen. So apply, see where they get you. And I promise you if you connect with some BX or any BX all of them will say I never ever thought I'd get in. And there they are now having a life changing and very empowering experience because they put their hand up and gave themselves a chance. So put your applications in. I sound like wearing There's commercials for knives or something. I really am very passionate about the program. And I'd love to see you also have the chance to be part of it. Rachel - UTS Business School 50:08 Excellent. Thanks for showing fantastic advice as well. We've had a question come in about when it comes to your 12 HSC reports. Do we have a mandatory rank? And no, not the case at all? Now we're having a, as I said, we've got a little bit of time for questions as well. We've had some that come through. We'll give attendees a couple of minutes while they're getting this questions in. I'm going to throw to Georgia, Brianna. And then John in that order. As I said, you're on the other side of the HSA, obviously, with the benefit of your experience so far, what advice would you give your HSA self? Georgia - BAcc Student 50:56 Oh, this is difficult. Um, I think, in general, echoing what Michelle said that every opportunity you don't take is a missed opportunity. If you don't apply for the app, guess what you're not gonna get in because you haven't applied. It's as simple as that. So just apply even if you're a bit unsure as to what you want to do. If you don't apply, you're gonna miss out. And it's an incredible opportunity, incredible experience. And it's an amazing program that I would recommend every single person if I could, who wants to take business? Who wants to do accounting, everything like that? Just just apply? That's all I'd say. Justify. Rachel - UTS Business School 51:35 Excellent, Briana. 51:40 I'm gonna go with two actually. I have. The first one is I like to go into things with the mindset of what's the worst that can happen within reason. Within reason, obviously, you know, when I was applying for this course, I thought, Oh, look, it's a really, really competitive course. What are the chances I get in but I thought, you know, what's the worst that can happen? They can say no, and I can be on my way. But yeah, like George just said, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take so, you know, go into it thinking what's the worst that can happen? If the worst thing can happen is someone saying no to you, I really don't think it's that bad. Just have big crack at it. And the other thing is, if you do something, put 100% of your effort in. And so if you're going to do it fully commit, so whether or not you get into B Act, the course itself, put 100% of effort into whatever you're doing. If you're doing the HSC if you're there while you're there, put 100% of your energy in and once you walk out, it's over. It's done. But yeah, you don't want to have a walk out of somewhere thinking, Oh, maybe I could have put in a little bit more effort. You don't want to look back with that sort of regret. Rachel - UTS Business School 52:44 Excellent. Again, great advice. John, it's always hard going last. You got any other advice that you'd like to add? 52:53 No worries, probably the only thing I could say is sort of, as everyone's mentioned, there is no harm in a bind. The worst scenario sort of Briana said, the worst case scenario is you don't get in and you've written a great CV, you've written an application, and you've just had an interview experience that is both individual and networking sort of component and start when you meet people, and then group activities. And then presenting your idea, your resolution to the question. And then an individual interview, which mom was a chairman, we talked about dual labor for 10 minutes of all things. But yeah, the worst that can happen is you write a great CV, you have an interview experience, and you've just gained two great things, but just apply. So as HSC students, I know you've got a lot going on. I know I got on the application process early. As I thought, Look, I'm already tight for time. Now imagine how top of time I'm going to be in the future as we get close to exams. So I would recommend students to get on it now, as opposed to later I think it's, I always just felt more comfortable when I have gone through, I've got my internship secured, I can, sorry, not my internship at an interview secured, I can put that to his side for now and think about my studies. And we'll get to that later. So there is no problem in applying. It'll take a few hours to write a good reference or whatever good application. But yeah, so many benefits of just applying in itself. And by the chance you get in life changing experience. That's Rachel - UTS Business School 54:19 excellent, great advice. Thank you, John. will now be answering some of your questions. I know Karen has been furiously answering. So to give her fingers a little bit of a break. We'll answer some of them live. Now this is a really common one. Say someone submitted their application, the cutoff date comes and goes. Michelle, how soon do they usually find out whether they've been successful in securing an interview or not? Michelle Cook 54:45 In a week? Week? Fantastic. So closures that brighter than 90 the following Friday, they'll know whether they've secured an interview. Rachel - UTS Business School 54:53 Excellent, fantastic. Yes, exactly. Now, we've had another question come through that says, and again, I'm loving it because it's chronologically. So say they do make it to the interview stage. How long is the interview? Michelle Cook 55:09 Oh, well, it's about 40 minutes in, in the lab doing the group assessment, because we tried to get to know each other first time relax a little bit. And then they have time to solve the problem and present their solution, as John was saying, then they will have an interview. And that's roughly about 20 to 25 minutes per interview. Rachel - UTS Business School 55:34 Excellent, fantastic. Now, if someone applies for round one, but is unsuccessful, can they apply again for round two? Michelle Cook 55:46 I've forgotten is that dual? Applying for round one and then trying again, for round two. We don't generally allow that selection criteria remains. But the selection criteria alignment remains the same. And yeah, yeah. So they said that's. So that's why I'm saying if you think you are going to do a bit more for your CV, then maybe apply and happening by the 13th of October. Rachel - UTS Business School 56:18 Excellent. And someone is also asked, What do we need to submit for the second round of applications? It's exactly the same as the first round of application. Yes. Michelle Cook 56:25 The only reason we had that is it's terrible wording. I know, and I'm so sorry, we've been trying to find a better way to sort of explain it. So first round, is, in the past, there used to be a lot of Cadet ships. And there's they're still Cadet ships now. But at least it gives students the option of knowing that they might have an interview, and they can let the cadetship organization organizations No. And then the second round, of course, is only for those people who have not yet applied and want more time to write their application. Rachel - UTS Business School 57:00 Excellent, fantastic. So again, do we if we apply in October instead of May, are we at a disadvantage? Absolutely not. Briana, did you apply in round one or round two? 57:16 I believe that I did round one look my memories a bit off. But I was pretty set on trying to get it in as early as I could. So I think it was round one. But to be totally honest, it's not something that gets taken into consideration. They're not going to judge you. Like I've not heard Michelle, tell anyone all you around to obviously what happens at it. Why are you hesitating? But no. Round One, round two doesn't really matter which one, it's just mainly out of consideration for you and your time, especially with HSE being in the later months of the year. Rachel - UTS Business School 57:56 Absolutely. I mean, we have to application rounds, genuinely for a reason one of them isn't like a trick or a way of trying to test motivation or anything, they are legitimately exactly the same in terms of intake as well. Now, one question that is a really, really good one. How does the actual scholarship component of the coursework, Michelle, in terms of how is the funding broken up? And how is that allocated? Michelle Cook 58:27 So students will receive that scholarship every fortnight on a Wednesday 10am I just thought I'd let you know about that, because people get excited about that. And that is a tax free scholarship that will come straight to the students. So it goes to the bank account, your own bank account, students asked me, you know, how can they use that money, they can use it in any way they prefer. So it doesn't necessarily have to go to a fee paying, etc, etc. It depends on what they need would need to use that money for. So it's every fortnight or Wednesday at 10am and that gets paid from UTS straight into the successful candidates a bank account. Rachel - UTS Business School 59:20 Excellent, fantastic. Now, I think some of the questions again, Karan in the background has been as soon as the question comes in Karan has been fantastically answering them. Michelle Cook 59:36 Here the backgrounds. Amazing. Rachel - UTS Business School 59:41 Again, a question about when you find out about the interview after week after applications close. How many applicants do you select for the interview process? Michelle Cook 59:51 It's all on the same dates of Yes. So there's no set number. So if you know Everyone has the opportunity to get an interview then that and the caliber of the CV is correct. And they're getting interviewed. Rachel - UTS Business School 1:00:09 Excellent. Okay, fantastic. So we've actually reached the end of our session. Thank you again so much to our panel, to Georgia to Brianna, to John for sharing their experiences. Huge, huge thank you for Bianca, for giving up your time. And as I said, for all the wonderful support that PwC has given the program for 28 years, that still blows my mind, it's older than almost all of our students that are currently enrolled. A friendly reminder to everyone again, that applications for round one close on Friday, the 19th of May, again, just to reiterate, you will not be disadvantaged. If you want to sit out this round and wait until October. That's totally fine. If you've got any questions, please get in touch with us coop.ed@uts.edu.au. That will come through to the lovely Karen. If you wanted to visit us and chat in person, we will be holding our UTS open day on Saturday, the 26th of August, you'll be able to chat to Michel, our current students, and also some of our academics and students from other business disciplines if you're interested in those as well. Again, thank you so much. Have a lovely evening. We hope you found the session useful. Thanks so much. Michelle Cook 1:01:32 Thank you so much, Rachel. Thank you everyone for joining.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/transdisciplinary-innovation/undergraduate-courses/diploma-innovation/key-dates-and-events,"Find out when subjects in the Diploma in Innovation at TD School are running. The Diploma in Innovation team run regular Information Sessions, AMAs (Ask Me Anything sessions), bookable ‘office hours’, guest talks and more. Our events will be listed on TD School events From time to time, we update the recording of the information sessions we have given. Here's a recording from a previous information session. So, here's a prize question. And let's see how many of you know the answer to this, here's what do you think are the top skills that employers are looking for? Teamwork, critical thinking. There are always questions about what exactly is a skill? is innovation, a skill? mindset? All right. So yes, yes, and yes to some of these, for the top one, the will to improve, I've often heard the growth mindset as a, as one way to look at that as well, too, is challenging the status quo, not accepting the way things are. And no matter how good things are, things are, of course to is to say, there must be a better way, there must be something better out there. Research published by the World Economic fund by research done by fathom AI, which is a Sydney based AI startup, actually, they do the back-end analysis for the World Economic Forum on this data. They publish the jobs of the future report year after year, after year, or every couple years, but they do it consistently. And the top skills are relatively stable, pretty much every time they've done the analysis that this idea to think analytically and critically challenge the status quo. and innovate is above and beyond the number one skill out there that employers are looking for. The next one's down, then number two, and number three are still quite stable. And then after that, the next couple ones tend to be there and then kind of change order every once in a while. But what you'll see here is you’re innovating in more and more in an increasingly complex environment in a way that simply just can't be automated away, you're dealing with humans that you have to interact with them in a very collaborative, cross sectional cross functional way. So above all of that is kind of the purpose. I'm like, why are you doing this? Well, to make things better to innovate, you're in the right place if you're here to learn innovation and learn how to improve things. So who are we so I'm Associate Professor Martin Bliemel. I'm the course director for the Diploma in innovation. If you Google around, I've won a handful of awards around teaching entrepreneurship education. I've developed a couple courses, we've got a Rockstar teacher here, Julia French has consistently beat me in terms of the teaching ratings. It's just absolute amazing terms of her ability to teach innovation frameworks, entrepreneurship frameworks, and pull in some amazing industry partners. We also have two students who have done the diploma in innovation. So you will hear really good stories about you know what brought them to it what did they expect. How did the program meet their expectations, and by all means, we're all on the floor for you to ask them questions to so you're not just hearing the message we want you to hear, but also the Frank, the more Frank version of it, too. So I'll give you a quick overview of the diploma in innovation, and then open up to a q&a with the students, facilitated by Julia. And then answer any questions freely through either through the chat or through using your mic and video. And, of course, some guidance on how to apply. So why the Diploma in Innovation? So the Diploma in Innovation is for those that need to innovate, to be entrepreneurial, to seek ways to create value. And this goes beyond just starting companies that need to innovate and create value is in a collaborative way is hands down what people are looking for. And so what you can do is you've got your core degree, and this degree of this diploma degree adds to every single bachelor's degree, except for the BCII, which is already a double degree which overlaps to some extent with this year. And the ethos of it is to think really big to say, Okay, great, you might have this problem. But maybe this problem is actually a symptom of a much, much, much bigger problem, a more complex problem that needs deeper, more collaborative thought about how to how to change that problem. One slogan we've heard is to change the system, not the climate. And that's exactly the kind of thinking we want is people, students who really want to shake things up and change the way things are. And realize it's not just you know, about a product or service, but it's about the whole whole of systems approach. And some students do this purely for that experience for the industry partners. And others say, Actually, you know what, that extra parchment matters that I have a bachelor's degree. And I've got this other thing that really distinguishes me that I can go to the job market to employers, to partners, co-founders and say, Look, I've got this additional qualification. Coming out of this, you'll have the qualification, but also an amazing portfolio project you'll have worked on. And towards the end, we'll also touch on how this is also a pathway to the BCII. If you've heard about it and want to hear more about it, we can definitely take on those questions on the q&a. So as I mentioned, analytical thinking innovation is the number one skill for future jobs. In parallel with that, there's increasing data and trends showing that jobs are changing relatively quickly, that before used to have a job or a career for life. Now, it's more likely that you'll have three or four careers. And each, each of those careers will have four or five jobs in it. And that by the time you graduate, you might be picking up jobs that didn't exist at the time you started your degree. A lot of job titles and job roles are changing at a relatively rapid pace. Here's a more recent study from I guess a recent study from alpha beta, which is local consultancy, some a bit more specific to the Australian context, but still applies globally is that they're looking very specifically, not just for people who are innovative, but people who can bridge disciplines who can bridge sectors, who can bring together people who might normally or naturally disagree. So these are just a handful of reports are any many, many, many more. And they all reemphasize more or less the standpoint that the road to success is in the future of jobs, the way ahead is through picking up innovation and entrepreneurial capabilities. But those are just kind of one way to look at it. The more holistic way to look at it is that we teach you how to do that in a way that embraces complex systems thinking. So taking a very systems view of Okay, I'm not just solving a problem, but I'm addressing all problem space. That's the network of related situations, really related problems. And so you're doing that in a way that creates value. So that's innovative, entrepreneurial, and you're solving those problems, and you're doing a way that has specific innovative and transdisciplinary practices and methods. Underlying all of this is that you're doing this in a very ethical way and imaginative way, you know, you wouldn't want to be getting this any mischievous or conniving way. You know who doesn't want a better world that has better social equality and social equity, social justice. And more so in this degree than I think any other degree at UTS is the or this the intrapreneurial and the entrepreneurial skills to and what you'll see is that each of the graduate attributes for the Diploma in Innovation are portable across jobs and across careers. Some of the graduate attributes that you see in your core degree might be specific to You say in accountancy or to nursing or you know your initial degree or your initial career path. But as your career path evolves, what you should also be looking for some of these portable, portable skills that you can apply in job after job or career after career. So the diploma in innovation is something that takes in students from every discipline from every faculty, and it brings you all together, and it's sort of a melting pot. And it's by and large for students who are looking for that competitive edge as the framing around what are the employers of the future want. So what we look for is students who really have that innate creativity or innovation, but also that curiosity to figure out how to do all of this. Before you, I guess, we get into too much of a debate about it. Yes, creativity can be taught. We're not necessarily born equally creative, or some more creative than others. Just as many other things can be taught. In terms of the career paths forward, this could be applicable for more than startups in the startups of side hustlers. But many, many people as they go further down the career path end up having the wrong career. So they are their own professional practices. So you might become your own independent consultant, you might become a creative consultant, you might, run your own medical practice. So what you want to learn is your discipline specific capabilities, but also learn how to how to build a very creative, innovative enterprise around that, or understand the enterprise context in which you're fulfilling your disciplinary capabilities. So this is more of the structure of the Diploma in Innovation. So we got your one, year two, year three vertically here. And it's designed to start right in the July session, right in the winter session of your first year. And then continue in the summer session between first and second year. So there's a there are subjects that run in the July session and the winter, also subject and run on the December session and the beginning of summer, and some that run in February towards the end of summer. So you're getting most of your summer, we're not taking away whole summer, and you're actually getting a substantial chunk of your winter as well. The other thing to note is that these subjects run two days a week, to three weeks, so it's not full time for those three weeks, it's part time. And if you do decide to take the diploma towards your second year, should any of you already be in your second year, even your third year, you can actually take this in an accelerated pathway. And we can get into that a little bit later. But the gist of this here is that you start with first just exploring complex problem spaces. So don't race to a solution, find out what a really good problem is, what is a problem worth solving, then we'll provide you more and more systematic methodological approaches to say okay, now that we've identified a really good, interesting, complex problem, how do we, how do we unpack it? How do we how do we start to come up with creative solutions for it? The third part of that creative intelligence series, data says, okay, a lot of that so far has been here. Now, let's look at what does the future look like? How do we make our solution sustainable? What is the future this this complex system? So a lot of that sounds relatively abstract for each of these subjects, we do provide some really concrete tangible industry partners. This then gets threaded in with the entrepreneurship stream. So in July, we're looking at a specific context, like the entrepreneurial ecosystems. Last July, we ran a partnership between the Regional Development Australia, Sydney regional development, Illawarra, and six local councils for them to understand how each of the councils function as a system that develops entrepreneurial values. So that's either growth in jobs in the existing companies or new companies for new products and new services. And how those precincts or those councils can interact with each other. This time around, we're looking at more of a CBD based ecosystem, then we look at what is the context in which entrepreneurship or value creation happens? Then we dig deeper on okay, how does one individual do something about this? How do you experiment and use innovation frameworks to really carve out your place within this environment? And then level that up to say, Okay, that's good for one opportunity? How does it look like if you're treading platform for you to build on for others to build on? And how do you ask other people's platforms to pursue your opportunity? And how do you how do you get scale? This is the recommended sequence of subjects you can actually take the subjects out of sequence and on the diploma Page, the URLs in the bottom corner. On the left-hand side, there's an FAQ. Further down there, there's, there's, there's more detailed description on how you actually might sandwich this down to two years, I think, possibly even one and a half years. So because it's two days a week, three times a week, you can take two and have them simultaneously. That gets pretty intense, but entirely doable if you're approved. Alright, and so pathways wise, kind of zooming back out, you've got your bachelor's degree, there's the diploma in innovation that adds all this value to it, and helps contextualize it and really leverage it, and help you stand out to everybody else who's graduating from UTS and any other university with just that just degree. And should you be interested in the startup scene, there is a natural segue to that where you know, you might be interested in being a founder or working for a founder or working in an innovative company. For those of you who are still a bit shy, about startups, do really have a close look at them, because 90% of the new jobs created are from these high growth companies are from startups. For those of you interested in the pathway to BCII, you can start with a bachelor's degree, you can start with a diploma. And partway through, you can transition to the BCII after the first few two diploma subjects. And then here too, there's a segue to the startup scene. But it's a bit more time because BCII usually through its fourth-year internship experience, points students towards internships and working in the, I guess in the corporate world first, and getting some experience before then having you reconsider joining startups or high growth companies. Lastly, everyone from the business school they run this honors and entrepreneurship program. So it's a one-year program that really complements that you've done the bachelor's degree and diploma in innovation n, and you're interested in startups. Some of the students have done that actually end up in the corporate world to be the intrapreneur. And you can take a little bit of a shortcut that you can take two of the subjects out of the diploma, and have them recognized against the bachelor in entrepreneurship honors as well. So you take less work so you can focus more on getting things done. Lastly, fresh off the press is our latest attempt to visualize some of these pathways where coming soon in 2022. There are some general electives and transdisciplinarity. But right now we have these innovation electives. These are the subjects in the diploma you can't take the you can dabble in the diploma, on a subject-by-subject basis. Although we do recommend apply for the diploma that then instantly lets you self-enrol to any other subject right away. You don't have to submit any requests. Some degree programs have innovation sub majors, so they create a creative digital enterprise sub major in business is a popular one. If you have a choice, try and fit one of these transdisciplinary sub majors in there. And then of course, there's the diploma in innovation. And some people go into the BCII. Some startups and other ones after the job market. How to apply? We've tried to make this relatively straightforward. Thanks to COVID. Everything shifted online, no more printing paper going to the student centre is to go to dpin.uts.edu.au, there's an application form there should be relatively straightforward to fill out, email it to the ftdi PO. Within about a day or two they send it to me I have the final approval. I've yet to reject one other than the students who I couldn't accept because they were already graduating. So if you've come to UTS, then that's usually the threshold that you're currently enrolled students and will embrace you with open arms. And we don't worry too much about grades because we've seen some amazing students who are just outliers. That's, you know, academic content isn't necessarily the strength button, and they're creative and go getters. So applications close on 25 June. Although we do encourage you to apply as soon as you think about it, don't put it off because it's too easy to set and forget. Get it done as soon as you can and give yourself the option to have that amazing future. And tell your friends. At this point if there are any burning questions jump in. Otherwise we'll segue to Julia facilitating q&a with the students. So I saw there the couple we had a couple more people join us so that that's cool. Um, so we'll just chat briefly with Connor. So Connor graduated from the diploma this last term. And he's had me for several of his subjects. And then Olivia, I begged and pleaded for her to come tonight and talk to you guys. And she's now doing the honors, Bachelor of entrepreneurship that Martin just mentioned. And her core degree was in communications, Connor, yours was in mechatronics. Correct? engineering and mechatronics? Yeah, Yeah. mechatronics and mechanics, mechanics. And so I think, there's a wide diverse group. So that kind of gives you an aim, like, explains like the different types of students that we have that come in it's definitely not your normal kind of like only engineering. Only, you know, startup kind of founder types that are like building something. It's really, we're really here to teach you about innovation and everything that's happening that encompasses all things innovation. So I came up with some questions with Connors help of kind of just what I guess is like, when you're making your decision on taking the diploma, like it's an extra, like it's doing something more than what you would normally do which at you're aged, you know, 18,19,20 and 21,22. You'd rather be doing other things maybe. So you have to have like a real, like, feeling that this is something that's for you. So I wanted to kind of ask Connor and Olivia, and we can kind of start with that is like the first question. So I came up with three questions, I'll share them in the chat, so you guys can also see them. Um, but I think the one big one I'll start with is what would you say are the characteristics that were similar between yourself and maybe all of the other students that you encountered in your different diploma subjects? And why do you think that is? And then how did that create the experience that you had that was completely different than the other experiences? You had a UPS? Okay. So the big one, which definitely has to be mentioned, is just having an inner drive. So someone who can go to class and be excited about learning and be willing to take on the opportunity to do some more research and learn something new, something completely different to what they would normally do. Another trait that I saw was naturally curious. So, you know, you see something happen and instead of thinking, you know, oh cool that just happened? You question why it happened? What made it happen? And if you change the variables, how would that change? The last one, which I found was quite important to consider is not being in it just for the certificate of graduation. You know, if you go into it thinking I’m just here for a slip of paper, I don't think it's going to be as useful. But if you go in with the attitude of, what can I learn today, then it would be quite a fun degree. Would you say that as you were kind of like getting going once you started, and then you started kind of going down the path, like you started to see the different, I guess, like work opportunities that were kind of down at the end? Like, did you feel like that you started off kind of going like, Oh, I don't really know where this is gonna lead? And then you're like, Oh, actually, I can see that. There's job opportunities, and there's all these other opportunities. Yeah, absolutely. So when I started the diploma, you know, 18,19 years old, I had no idea what I wanted, I’m 22 now, I still have no idea. But I've sort of just picked up on different skills throughout. One of the great things about the diploma is the cross contamination between other majors. So as an engineering student, we've done no core work of communication, marketing, anything to do with that. Through the skills that I learned from just contamination of other people's conversations with marketing students, I sort of got a gauge of how to do marketing. And I've started my own company recently. And I've just done a marketing gig for a company because I just learned how to do it from the diploma. So you do get quite a wide range of skills from it that can lead to some pretty incredible job opportunities. Another great job opportunity from it was we so in one of the subjects I did with Martin last year, we collaborated with IDA Sydney and Cobra Council. And that ended up leading on to a bit of a pilot study. And underneath Martin, there was quite a number of us that just went through and continued the work that we were doing in the subject for an assignment. And we did it as a job for a couple of months that was really cool as well, because I've got to make a paper with cogra, I love it I love it. Um, and that's everything that I wanted to say. Like, if I could say, well, that I've been that's what I would say it's a little better if you if you say it, and it's actually real. So Olivia, I have it for you. What would you What would you say would be your characteristics that you think are all similar between like, what do you encounter have in common? How did you end up in the same class and doing the same diploma? I would say I feel like most people during doing the diploma want to do it because they want to broaden their skills from their standard degree. Because obviously, when you're doing your core degree, you're surrounded by all the same people. And you don't really learn anything beyond the standard theory. And the diploma is a completely different experience you really like bounced off everyone else's knowledge, you learn a lot more. Yeah, it's kind of said you get to like learn about different faculties. I personally did it because I wanted, I do communications, but I wanted more of a business side. And I feel like I definitely got that problem the diploma. Um, but other characteristics. We think that's, yeah, definitely. As long as you're willing to really give the three weeks, you're all really take it as a learning opportunity. Yeah, don't just rush over work. Don't just do the assignment. I feel like I did that in my very first subject. But I quickly learned that that was the wrong thing to do. So yeah, that is probably probably it. And then what about a job was like, so now you've gone on and you're doing the honors? a Bachelor of entrepreneurship? Yeah. So yeah. Do you feel like you were as prepared? Well, to like, go ahead and take that. I mean, that's a pretty high course level, like that's, like, almost master's degree for your young selves. Like, do you feel like you were prepared when you got in there? And it was like, you were ready? Or do you feel like, I don't know. Like, how has that experience been in job wise? Like, do you feel like you have opportunities that are coming your way? Yeah, definitely. Like, before I finished the diploma before I was considering jobs, I would have never really considered the startup space or anything like that beforehand. But now it's like, you kind of have the choice of which path you want to go down. I'm still not sure myself, but I know that there are two options available. With regard to the honors? Um, yeah, definitely. Because the diploma has lots to do with startups. That definitely helped it. Definitely my vocabulary. And like, I know a lot of the jargon, which is helpful already to know so early on in the Honors. Yeah, that, I'd say I'm decently prepared, not 100%. But yeah, it definitely helped. Helped me get into that kind of area. Okay. And then I guess, what would you say for you, Olivia? What would you say? are the three things that kind of stand out for you in the diploma? Like if you had to give somebody like, these were the three most like extraordinary things that happened while I was in the diploma? Well, what would you highlight? If you had to pick three out of all of your different subjects? The best thing for me was always like the dynamic of the classes. It's very, very, very different to your core degree classes. I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. But to me, it was a good thing. It was almost a bit like, because you like high school, because you spend the entire day together. And it's not so isolated in your own learning, which I personally enjoyed. Do lots of group work? It's a group projects group work. No exams, no. Written assessments. Okay, and then what else do would you say were your other two that you thought were like, Wow, this is awesome. Or a moment when you were just like sitting there and you're like, wow, I learned something today. Like I didn't know that before. That's really interesting. Like I didn't know about that. I'm probably the project in the it's called the 94662 subjects. It basically was you pursue a startup idea as far as you can in the span of three weeks. And my first day compared to my last day, like my change in mindset was crazy. Like, I did not think we would take it as far as we did, like, we ended up getting to a clickable prototype. So by the end of it, I was like, Damn, I did not expect that to come out of the subject. But it was definitely worthwhile to really work well, for a week. So yeah, that's good. And then what would you say would be like another, like, highlight where you're like, Oh, this isn't so great. Like, like, there's own good things and bad things about every experience, right? So if you had to, like pick like a thing that you were like, this is not so awesome. What would you probably pick the fact that it's like three to four assessments in the span of three weeks. But having said that, it is a good learning experience, I find helps you work under pressure, make you more efficient in the next semester to come. So yeah, all about the efficiency area, you know, I am all right corner for you. What would you say are like your top three kind of like highlights, like positive one, something where you win something, and then maybe something where like, it just wasn't that awesome. So one of the, I guess key moments that stuck with me was in one of your classes. I think it was the evaluating portfolios, one. Yep. And we'd gotten given an assignment that was really quite difficult. And due to the time constraints of the subject, we really only had two or three days to get it done. Everyone got something in handed it in submitted. And you came back into class the next day and said, guys, that was crap, you've got 24 hours to resubmit. Here's what you did wrong. And what I like about that was the fact that it's just, it's about the material and not about being tested on it, you know, you, you guys seemed more interested in making sure that we all knew what we're talking about, rather than just handing out marks or not handing out marks. So that was something that really stuck with me. presentation skills is something that is always required to practice. And through the glimmer of innovation, you're having to present, whether it's getting up in front of the class and just giving a presentation or presenting to, you know, massive guests like audio Sydney, you sort of get that opportunity to practice putting on this professional accent and talking to people. Third one is they say that you can't teach creativity. But you can definitely learn methods and tools to nurture an individual's creativity. Behind me in that bookshelf, I've got a stack of about 150 different methods that you can use to, I guess, spark an idea. Another method cards that you'll get in the various subjects, and I still use them. We were told to put them back in the box at the end of class, but I still use them. It's still helpful. Alright, and then your third one that you really like, this is not so great. Yeah, look, I guess that goes along with what Olivia was saying about just the intensity of it, and having all the assessments do. But honestly, you just sort of knuckle down and get through it. You know, you can have a bad time if you get pinned with a poor group, which is bound to happen at least once or twice. But apart from that, I didn't really find too many negatives with it. Like my skills, you have to learn how to work with a pool group. The pace is something that's definitely like we try and have it with assignments and assessments build on one another. But I think it's a large amount of material. I mean, it's a subject where the material that you're learning in basically like you get in for the first day, kind of acclimate, and you got basically two weeks, like I completely agree. Is there anything else that you guys would want to add? Or maybe you've given some examples Connor already whether diplomas had an impact on your future you've given some already to Olivia? Is there anything else that you guys would kind of add or say like, in regard to the value that you feel that you found like value like time or like time reward ratio? Do you guys feel like it was worth the efforts? I think it's a great opportunity for networking. You know, you're meeting 3040 different students from really, really Different areas of university every time you do a class, choose the guest speakers that come in. Now I've got all the guest speakers that you brought in on LinkedIn, so Do you want to talk about any of those guest speakers where they like people that you would normally get access to, like, are they? Absolutely not. It's people who are just so high up in the innovation world. But if you would never even consider sending them a LinkedIn request. But, you know, I've got most of them, and I follow them. And, you know, it's really interesting to see the things that they do, and they post every day, but I wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet them. Without that, so I think that was really cool. Olivia, how about you? I was gonna say that the fact that most of the time you're working in like real life, client problem spaces. Like I remember my very first subject impossibilities, to possibilities. We were building a solution on automated vehicles. And we ended up presenting to Sydney transport, I'm pretty sure. And yeah, that was just something that I wouldn't have expected to do. Especially not in my first like six months of uni, because I was in first year at the time. But um, yeah, just making the most of like, dealing with real life problems. And, you know, like the fact that your solution actually matters and, you know, it anything's possible kind of thing. it's your life imagined. All right. Does anybody have questions for Olivia and Connor? guys want to drop them in the chat or? Rachel No, Luca, no. I just have one question. Thank you to Olivia and Connor for sharing that was really great. But just in terms to enrolment, so I'm going to be finishing up this year at UTSA. I was wondering if I could still enrol into this diploma or if it's just like for electives during summer in winter? You can still enrol now this is probably the last window to enrol as long as you enrol while you're currently a student. If you were to start your first diploma subject at the end of the year, after you've finished the last course credit towards your core degree, that wouldn't work because then it would technically be post-graduation. But if you start now, this July, you can finish the diploma out of sync with the frame record degree. So you can start you can start the diploma anytime as long as you're enrolled, anytime as you're an actively enrolled student at UTS, but you don't have to finish at the same time. You can't finish with a diploma before your core degree, but you can finish afterwards. So some students have finished the core degree gone and done some work experience and the nice thing about the incentive structures you can tell your employer co-founder, whoever you're working with or for and let them know hey, look, I need to take two three weeks off to focus on wrapping up this another this next block of eight credits. Okay, make sense. Thank you very much. Have first year students completed this Diploma in their first year? Completed no started Yes. I mean, the desired or the recommended pathways to take three years to finish the diploma. That said it's you need to complete six of the diploma subjects to finish your diploma. But because they run in July, December and February, within one calendar, you can already finish three subjects. So every two years you can finish the Diploma in two years. And because some subjects run some are almost simultaneously some wonderful one will run Mondays and Thursdays and the other one on Tuesdays and Fridays out of the five days a week if you're running to do something simultaneously. You can actually pack it in to just over a year. It's a bit crazy, but you can do it. Just to jump in on that. That's actually what I did. So my first session, I just did one subject and my last session, I did one. But July and December last year, I did two in each of those. And it's intense. But you know, if you're ready to knuckle down and just do it, then it's definitely is doable. And you know, I did that with two or three days of work even, so you don't go completely mad, I promise. New questions here, how do you progress through the diploma if there are no exams? And well, just a second one, a second question separately. All good questions. So the, what we do, I mean, even we, as lecturers, subject coordinators, course directors don't like exams, what we do is give you a live case study. And usually it's just the conventional form is to give you some group work, that's usually a combination, mainly of individual work, to help you draft it from the team. That's based on the, I guess, the concepts that we're teaching you. And usually, it's a summary of what you've done, through and submitting it to turn it in. But then towards the end of it, it's there's a performative aspect of it to where you're not just doing your work, but you can present it sometimes in a creative way as well, depending on the subject, sometimes video version too, but there's often a presentation version of it too. And the presentations, we often open up to the Insert partners who are in the classroom, but also some of the other people who are around the ecosystem who are interested in the same space. And this is often their chance to keep an eye out for interesting students who they might want to offer jobs to, at the time that diploma ends. So there's, the second report is usually more group oriented. And then towards the end, there's usually an end, usually an individual reflection that comes off the end of it. So it's, and that's really should summarize, not just what you did, but what you learned how you develop the capabilities based on what you did. So by the time you finish, you'll have something that you presented to the industry prior, it's something very project based that will be part of your professional portfolio, you'll have a document that's more of a learning record. So it's not an exam, we're not testing you want content, or really testing against the graduate attributes that I showed earlier around complex problem solving and trading value. And all that. So let me know if that doesn't answer your question. So the second part of the question was, if I'm doing a Bachelors of business, slash Bachelor’s of Science and information, it can I still apply for the innovation honors. You can. So the diploma in innovation is not a bachelor in innovation, it's a diploma in innovation, not because it's designed at the at the qualification level, the diploma, if you're into qualification frameworks, we can talk about those. But it's the level of education is the same as the level of education you get at the bachelor's degree, also being a little higher, but it's a diploma purely because it's 48 credit points, just half the credit points of a bachelor's degree. So you can easily do a double not a double bachelor's degree. It combined bachelor's degree plus the diploma. So you can do that. Unless you're talking about the talking about the Bachelor of entrepreneurship honors, which you can also do that simply after you've finished your double degree, a Bachelor's. So yes, you can do the double core degree plus the diploma in innovation on top of it. Some of the early documentation and some older documentation says it's not possible. But that's nonsense. It is possible. And please feel free to drop a chat to say whether you've got a follow up question or if that's clarified. Thanks. And Annabel has a question. Hi there, is there any way of doing the Diploma in December and January sessions rather than the July sessions? not currently. There are some subjects in the July sessions that you can do in the other session. So 81539 and possibilities to possibilities also runs into summer. So you can do it then Julia’s subject on entrepreneur experimenting? We are piloting that in spring term. So there might be a way to do that. The ecosystem subject still a bit tricky to see if there's a way to do that out of the July session. So not currently, he could do some of the July sessions in the other term, but not all of them. Any other questions or? Guys, panellists? Do you have any comments? Welcome. William, do you have any specific questions? So is this year, the only time to enrol in diplomas innovation plug is open next year or it's open every year to intake windows. So it's got the intake now for July, and then it has another intake in for the December session. Okay, thanks for most students the July intake tends to make more sense. But we're we timetabled a second session of 81539. That's kind of the introductory subject in that recommended sequence. We put a second version of that in December, so that students can take an accelerated pathway. And if they missed the first window, can you defer offer until next year, you can, but I don't recommend it as easily just get going. Get in there. Learn in just try all the subjects. If you can try like towards an elective or even get enrolled in the diploma, get enrolled in a subject, try the first few days of the subject, see how things go by consensus, like consensus state, census state, and explore. So don't be too shy about enrolling. I mean, you'll find other students who are in this in the same boat and like-minded individuals, and the funniest part of it is learning together as a cohort and learning from each other. Martin, correct me if I'm wrong, that when I went to an info session, when I was looking at doing the diploma at the start, one of the questions that came up is if I do this, if I start the diploma, but realize I don't like it and don't want to continue, can that subject be part of my core degree? And from memory? That response was, you know, it's likely that you'd be able to disclaim that subject as an elective for your degree. Is that still the case? It depends on great question. Like it depends on your core degree. Some core degrees have choice blocks or elective slots. So in that case, usually all it takes is in a request, where you can say, Okay, I'm going back into the diploma, I want to transfer this credit out of the diplomate towards the elective or towards the choice block. Usually that that's all it takes isn't a request. Some degree programs are quite heavily programmed for credit purposes. I believe nursing might be one of those maybe engineering, where they don't offer a lot of electives because of the accrediting organizations like the Association of engineers that say you have to pack all of this insert curriculum. But like myself, course directors are all humans, you can't actually argue with them and say Actually, no, I do want this course credit. Because I think the subject is way more interesting than the introduction to thermodynamics. It is it is possible. Sometimes it's sometimes it's straightforward. It's just clicking through the student admin stuff. Sometimes it's an E request. And other times it's an email to the course director. We know you've got questions on your mind, ones that you're shy to ask. When through the first cluster in July, they start to finish on June 28. It's technically July session. I think the Monday subjects start on June 28. And then the Tuesday something start on the 29th. And then they finish on the 15th or 16th. So the date should be on dpin.edu.au I believe Michelle said that was tweaked and corrected so those states should be completely up to date that you see on the diplomas homepage. It's kind of the first expanding drop that drop down thing that you'll see on the website. Coming subject. Gonna put my email in the chat so if any of you guys have any questions about your timetabling your workload planning or reflecting on your course planning rather than drop me an email talk to her API to talk to Julia, if you have any other questions about, you know, the student's point of view, of course, Olivia and Connor would probably be more than happy to answer any questions. by email or LinkedIn, we're probably easy enough to find. Also you guys can join our LinkedIn page. And we'll send it in the follow up email. So you can kind of see like what's going on and what we're doing. No other questions? Can I take a Bachelors of engineering after the diploma, is it possible to do the degree of innovation as a double degree. So this is the I'm guessing you're talking about the BCII is the double degree program. So if you start with the core degree, and diploma innovation, these two introductory creative intelligence subjects are pretty much the only two that really overlap with the BCII. So if you start with a diploma, and finish these two subjects, then you can apply for an internal course transfer that combines your core degree with the BCII. So your core degree has to be compatible with the BCII as a double degree program, and you have to finish the first two trade of intelligence subjects. And there's some minimum grade requirements, you can find those on the FAQ. And then that way, you start with a diploma but then transferred to the BCII, so you can't do your core degree, plus the diploma and then into the BCII. What you can do is your core degree plus the diploma plus the bachelor's and entrepreneurship honors as kind of lived fourth year experience. There are a couple different ways to a couple different pathways through their All right. So thank you for sticking around asking really good questions. I mean, this is our opportunity to learn from you and see what students are interested in. Thank you, Olivia and Connor and Julia for hosting co-hosting this year and making sure the students hear the real story of what it's like. That usually tells a much better story. So, I mean, closing comments would be just apply now. It makes it much easier once you're in student admin to then say great, I'm going to choose these subjects, try them out. And then you can always decide later. Thanks, everyone.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/undergraduate/our-courses/find-right-course/events-and-info-sessions/discover-your-path-uni,"Ready to start your uni journey? Whether you’re applying to transfer from another university, TAFE or you are a mature age student with extensive work experience, your path to UTS is unique. Thanks for joining us on Tuesday 18 May for the Non-school Leaver Info Session. Webinar Transcription: Kenny: Alright hello everyone, can everyone hear me? Just a little thumbs up will be great if you can hear me. Brilliant. Thank you all so much for coming to today's Non-School Leaver webinar. It's great to have you all here. Firstly to begin, welcome my name is Kenny and I am a second year medical science student at UTS and today we will be talking about admissions schemes and generally just what UTS is like overall. But first I would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation on which our campus stands today and I would like to pay respect to the Elders both past and present and emerging and acknowledge them as the traditional custodians of the land. Now just as a disclaimer today's session will be recorded and so we will ask that you keep your cameras off and stay muted. Please keep all questions to the end after the panel session but as of now coming to the recording, coming to the session you have consented that the recording will be posted for public uses as well. So for today’s agenda we are starting at 5pm and we will be ending at 7.30pm. We will have Alison one of our panellists talking about admissions and then after that we will have a one on one chat session with our panellists and then at 7.30pm we will be concluding the event. So, to introduce our panellists today as I said my name is Kenny and I am studying a Bachelor of Medical Science and next up we have Hannah, say hi please. Alison: Hi everyone Kenny: She is studying a Bachelor of Midwifery. And then we have Georgie, say hi Georgie Georgie: Hi Kenny: Yep and she is studying a Bachelor of Business and a Bachelor of Law and finally we have Alison, Alison say hi Alison: Hi Kenny: Brilliant and so she will be running through with us about admissions schemes later on. So why UTS? Well UTS is very future focused and we really show that through our courses. Our courses are both practical and innovative and innovation is at the heart of UTS. Our courses are constantly re-designed and re-evaluated to meet with our industry demands and to really reflect the changing work environment as well – and practicality as well, we really pride ourselves on practical education with 85% of our students actually undertaking some form of internship or working on a capstone project at some point during their degree. This means you have an opportunity to put what you have learnt in our classes with our real world industry partners. So as you can see here we are the number one young university in Australia and that just means that we are the number one university that is under 50 years old. We have than 160 clubs and societies here and yes, we do have 5 star rankings in several categories, employability and innovation just being two of them. We are also fifth in Australia for graduate outcomes with 92.5% of our students employed full time within three years of graduation. And as I said 85% of our students will undertake internship or similar experiences as a part of their degree. And we understand that academics isn’t everything with you, so we really want to encourage you guys to harness your passions and see what you guys really like to do. You can join a club or society, we have over 160 clubs that range from academic, personal development and sporting and honestly it is great fun you should definitely join them. If you want to learn a language go for it, we have plenty of exchange programs as well whether you study a Bachelor of International Studies or you can even travel overseas with our global short and global BUILD programs. You can overseas for as little as two weeks up to a whole year. And for you entrepreneurs and champions of industry out there, we do have the UTS Startup program and in this we encourage you guys to enhance your entrepreneurial skills and we mentor you. We give you partnerships with our industry partners and really try to enhance your business skills. And again you can also apply your leadership in any one of these different aspects as well. And for those of you guys who are living quite far away from us, we do have on campus accommodation so you can really enjoy university life. Yes we are in the heart of the city and a great thing about us is that we are known to be in not only the heart of the city but in the heart of the creative industry of Sydney with 70% of Sydney’s creative industry in and around our campuses. Great thing as well, we are only 10 minutes away from Central Station, we are only 10 minutes away from Darling Harbour and 10 minutes away from Broadway so there’s no shortage of entertainment around here. And we do have academic support as well, if you do find it challenging getting back into studying there are plenty of academic supports available at UTS like UTS HELPS, U:PASS, Maths and Science Study Centres. These will help you with essay writing, resume writing, getting use to the different courses. We do have personal tutors as well available. You wont feel like you would be at any disadvantages. We have a range of courses here at UTS ranging from Business, Communication all the way down to Transdisciplinary Innovation which is one of our newer schools here. We can talk more about that later if you’re interested. Now, for those of you guys coming in – so what is a non-recent school leaver? So a non-recent school leaver is anyone who has not completed Year 12 in 2021. So, if you have completed your schooling back in 2019 or earlier then you would be considered a non-recent school leaver and if you have done further study as well you will be considered a non-recent school leaver. So, I think I will hand it over to Alison right now to talk about Admissions. Alison would you like to take over? Alison: Great, thank you so much! Okay - so good evening everyone, thank for attending our session. So I will start talking a bit about the admissions process when you apply to any of the undergraduate courses at UTS. So first things first, Kenny’s already mentioned that you would all need to be non-recent school leavers for this to be applicable or these to be more suited for you. So at UTS we consider the following studies for entry into all of our undergraduate courses, so as you can see here that would be a completed Australian year 12 or equivalent, studies from other Australian institutions whether incomplete or complete but I will talk more about that later, all tertiary preparation certificates and foundation studies courses, any TAFE and private provider studies, the STAT which is the special tertiary admissions test - just a note that we do only consider the multiple choice version. So typically all UTS courses will consider eligibility is you have completed a full year of full time studies at an institution. Just a note that this does need to be in the same course and in the same institution. There are a number or courses that will consider less than one year of studies so you can find out more information via the link uts.edu.au/admissions so there will be a lot more information on all the schemes and pathways available so you can have a look at that later. So, how to apply. So you may be aware that in order to apply to any of the UTS undergraduate courses you would need to lodge your application through UAC, which is the universities admissions centre. So you will be considered based on any assessable qualifications that you’ve done so remember to submit all qualifications wherever you have commenced any kind of studies. So please also note that some courses also have special entry requirements such as teacher education. Applications actually are currently open for Spring 2021 and Summer 2021, so that’s this year’s intake and we also already have courses open for Autumn 2022 next year, so you can check out our courses - there should be 156 of our courses available online already. Step two, you would manage your preferences through UAC as well. So in your UAC application you can list up to five course preferences, you can change your preferences at any time up until a few days before each offer round. You can also view the offer round dates on the UAC website. But I will go through the upcoming important ones in a later slide. So I’ve also got some quick advice for ordering your preferences. Pretty much you should always place the course you want to study the most as your first preference, then work your way down until you’ve filled all your maximum number of preferences or you have preferenced all the courses that you are interested in. You do need a minimum of one course to put in an application. We don’t recommend ordering your preferences based on how competitive you think you’ll be so you should always really consider what you actually want to do. During the selection process you will be considered for each course starting from your first preference and then working down to your last preference and then you will be made an offer to the first course on your list which you meet the entry requirements. So step three, you can boost your application through our admission schemes, at UTS we do have a variety of admission schemes on offer. So there is schemes which will take into account whether you have experienced long term disadvantage, whether this has impacted your studies which is called inpUTS. We also have our aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander students which can consider the Jumbunna pathways program. Step four, offers release. So offers are released progressively throughout the year. We’re currently making offers for courses for the spring intake. Early offers for Autumn 2022 will likely be made in late October. So, step five, accept your offer. If you’re eligible for an offer to UTS you will be contacted by email with information to help walk you through the steps to accept your offer and start enrolling. Great. So I will give you a little bit of a summary of the admission schemes that we have on offer. So we have a variety of merit based schemes on offer, so just going through the slides there’s the design and architecture portfolio scheme – so this is where you can submit an optional portfolio through the UTS website, if you’re selected then you will be asked to attend an interview and if you’re successful in the interview then you will be made a non-competitive offer. We also have the business cadetship scheme where you are awarded for attending a cadetship prior to commencement to your UTS business degree – for this scheme you also apply directly to UTS business school through the website. If you have any work experience at all you may be eligible for up to five adjustment points if your work experience relates to the course, all you need to do is complete the employment question in UAC. If you are interested and referencing courses in business, engineering, IT and science please remember to complete this if you have work experience. We also have the elite athletes and performers scheme which awards you five adjustment points if you have competed or performed at a national level – so to apply for this you will need to apply to UTS via the website and you would also need to put in the UAC applications to be considered. We also have as an alternate admission scheme the Science aptitude assessment, so this is if you missed a selection rank requirement for any of the science courses at UTS. It does assess analytical and critical thinking skills. There’s no need to study for it and its offered up to three times a year - one of the things is that you can only apply once per calendar year. So that’s the merit based schemes that we have available for non-recent school leavers. In terms of equity based schemes we have the educational access scheme, which is at UTS is called InpUTS. So if you are eligible for InPUTS then you are awarded ten adjustment points and it is for students who have experienced a disadvantageous situation during year 11 or year 12 or through any of your studies which is then assessed by UAC. In order to be eligible for entry into UTS though you do need a minimum ATAR or qualification rec of 69 or a rank of 80 for Law. So similarly you also need to apply through UAC as UAC are the ones that do the assessment of the educational access scheme. Last but not least we do have also the women in STEM, so that would be for female students applying for selected Engineering, IT or Construction project management courses – you will automatically receive ten adjustment points towards your selection rank. Great. In terms of admission pathways, so this is if you are trying to get into a course and you may fall short of the selection rank requirement just by a little bit or by more than that. So these are some pathways that you can consider before applying again in a later session. So one of the ones would be enrolling in a similar course with a lower selection rank and then reapplying to UTS after a year – so what you would do is use subjects from a degree with a lower selection rank and then you would study and do your best in that area or in that course – so where you have competitive marks in a similar course you will be considered in your application in the following year. You can also complete a UTS College Diploma where you can fast track yourself into the second years of studies into your chosen UTS degree by completing a diploma at UTS college. Another thing that you can do is that you can apply after one year from Uni, TAFE, or a private college. So you would need to study a diploma or a different degree, then apply to transfer at UTS after one full-time year of study. A note that this also includes the Tertiary Preparation Certificate. You may also be eligible for recognition of prior learning. Another pathway that we have, as I mentioned before the Jumbunna UNISTART program so this is for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. You can complete faculty based electives subjects and foundation subjects which will form a part of your degree and your program of study. So I will talk a bit about recognition of prior learning as I imagine that a number of you may have started or commenced studies in another institution. So, recognition of prior learning is when you would get RPL for subjects you may have completed – so the first thing you would need to do is research the subject content with the UTYS handbook, faculty website and the recognition of prior learning tool. Then you would compare UTS subjects and learning outcomes with the studies from your previous institution – so this is usually at the subject levels, so you would need to collate all of your subject outlines from those subjects you’ve completed. Then you would complete the recognition of prior learning application form, then attach all certified academic records which would be your transcripts and qualifications along with any other documents to support your application. So this would be then submitted through at the UTS student centre as soon as you accept your offer – this means that if you are eligible for any RPL then you wouldn’t need to complete those subjects again. Thank you Kenny: Thank you so much Alison, now we will be moving on to the student experience and we will be having a chat with our panellists available. May I please ask everyone to leave your questions at the end don’t worry there will be plenty of opportunities at the very end to answer your questions, so hold off on questions for now. Anyways, let’s get going. First question I’m sure everyone wants to know why we chose to study at UTS? So Hannah, could you start us off – why did you chose to study at UTS? Hannah: Yeah so when I was considering what I want to study, where I want to study, obviously like most year 12 students I was actually going to a lot of open days. When I went to the UTS open day, it was really clear that UTS had a lot of practice support and student support, so they actually really wanted students there – and when I was trying to think of what I wanted to do, I was considering midwifery but I wasn’t too sure on it, but UTS was number 1 in NSW, not in NSW sorry in Australia for Nursing and Midwifery and number seven in the world – correct me if I’m wrong and that was obviously a really big selling point, it was also one of the only Unis in Australia that offered it so its nice and close to home, offered midwifery and number 1 in Australia and when I did the tours the labs were really great so that was a really big selling point for me so decided from then that I wanted to do midwifery at UTS. Kenny: Wow, that’s amazing. How about you Georgie? Georgie: Yeah, so quite interesting – so I completed year twelve in 2015 and I didn’t actually attend a UTS open day, because I kind of had a preconceived idea of where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do and I actually spent my first year at a different university studying a Bachelor of Commerce and after a year I decided that it really wasn’t for me and then over the next few months I spent three months working with a team full of UTS students and essentially of that three month period they kind of wore me down and they spoke a lot about their experiences at UTS and how good the culture was and how inclusive and fun but also academically rigorous – which was really exciting for me and they also had a really big focus on entrepreneurship and innovation and someone who studies Business and Law that was really important to me and also just the opportunity to travel overseas through the course of my two degrees is super important also UTS had a lot of financial help available to do that which was very exciting so that’s why I chose UTS. Kenny: Thank you buy yeah haha you cut out, you cut out at the very end but thank you so much. So much like you Georgie I actually didn’t come to any of the UTS open days, I too had a preconceived notion of which University I wanted to go to before that. So for myself I was actually studying a Bachelor of Criminology and Criminal Justice and I spent two years there, nearly two and a half years at another institution before coming to UTS and I think some of the things that really drew me to UTS was their labs because I really wanted to look at their science courses and look at their facilities and I was just fascinated by the super labs at UTS and with our new Hive Super lab as well in building two its just amazing, you know we can have over 270 students in one go with seven classes running concurrently all doing different sort of sciences and it just builds up this atmosphere of you know wanting study more and learning more and just being passionate about science. Hannah could you talk more about that? What’s the environment like in the clinical stimulation labs? Hannah: Yeah, well funnily enough I actually got to use the super lab last year in my pharmacology class and I can confirm it is really wonderful it’s just this humongous lab and you’ve got all these students from different classes, it can be a bit confusing when you’re like oh do you know where this class is? And someone is like no? haha but yeah it is a really great lab. We also have a lot of clinical sim labs in Building ten ETS and that’s where we do the majority of nursing and midwifery learning. Those labs are really good because you have people, like you have called SIDman and they’re essentially people that stimulate conditions that people can have so you know it can show someone having high blood pressure or going into cardiac arrest as such things. You also have babies sim people, so that’s a really great way to visualise the practical aspect of learning, especially with Nursing and Midwifery where it’s hard to know what to do, like you don’t want to practice on a person for the first time and so yeah having those stimulation labs are really helpful for that. Kenny: and Georgie how did you find the experience with your cohort members is that something that drew you to coming to UTS? Georgie: Yeah, absolutely I think for me like the number one reason to come to UTS is the culture without a doubt. I think the people here, and maybe I’m just bias because I have a really good cohort with my Business and Law double degree – is everyone’s just really lovely, really supportive, really encouraging, but also still quite academic and career focused, which is like a really good balance that is often difficult to strike I think, so yeah I’ve had such a good experience with my cohort. Kenny: Continuing on Georgie, what sort of challenges did you face as a non-recent school leaver? Gerogie: Yeah absolutely, so I came from another Australian university, so for me academics wasn’t like necessarily an issue because I know some people can struggle when you go from that year 12 into university environment, that can be a really big jump. But for me the biggest concern was essentially making friends because I went through that recognition of prior learning process which Alison spoke about before I was kind of in this weird in the second year but in the first year situation, so I really had to kind of find a way to meet people and the best way to do that I found at least for me was to join a bunch of different societies and clubs, they’re always running events – even through Covid when we were all quarantined there were events online, but now we’re kind of transitioning back on campus, which is really great. So I joined the UTS business society, I also joined the consulting club, women in business and the Law society as well, there’s just so many things going on and then I was also kind of a bit more talkative in class I think, I had a bit of a technique where I’d walk into a tutorial and I would just find someone sitting by themselves who looked nice and would just sit next to them and say hi, cause a lot of the time people want friends as well. But yeah, that was kind of the biggest challenge for me. Kenny: I mean for myself I think coming into UTS one of the challenges that I thought I would be facing was sort of the age gap, I understand that in your first year you will be surrounded by mostly eighteen year olds who have just recently come out of high school and you know you didn’t want to seem a little bit weird. Did you face any sort of challenges like that? Georgie: I mean not necessarily, I think last week I had an event with some consulting club friends and one of the girls I was sitting next to was 19 and I’m 23, so there is a bit of a difference but at the same time like age is kind of just a number, you’re studying the same thing so generally your interests are quite similar or if they’re not there’s still a discussion to be had there, so yeah it didn’t really phase me at all to be honest. Kenny: Moving on, so Hannah this question is for you – How did your pathway better prepare you for UTS? So give us a little back story first. Hannah: Yeah, absolutely. So before I studied at UTS, I did my HSC, I did Year 12 and then I did a certificate course called the Academic Studies and Theology Certificate – so it was a program called Year 13 which was essentially a gap year program but it had some tertiary study elements to it. That really helped me, I really enjoyed that because it really helped me prepare for UTS and I did that because it was an environment where I could study with people who weren’t teenagers – who weren’t high school students and they were people who wanted to be there. That’s generally what you find in uni, you don’t have high school students working with you and you also have chosen that course and that was really a great way to understand how to collaborate with adults in an academic way. And the other great thing is that as it was a tertiary study program, it was self-directed so that learning is very similar to how I was learning at UTS. So I find that really helpful. Also, because I took a gap year it was a really great way to take a break from the intensity of the HSC and give myself time to think about what I wanted to do and to make sure I actually wanted to do that – I definitely wanted to study at UTS. As you can see I am here so! Kenny: Brilliant! So for Georgie, back to you again. So I understand that you have done a lot at UTS. I have seen your resume, you’re very active around UTS, joined so many clubs and just wanted to ask how has your UTS studies, whether it be extracurricular or whether it be the degree itself – how has it enhanced your career? Georgie: Yeah for sure, I feel like I could answer this question over 2 hours but I will try keep it super succinct. I think one of the first things that comes to my mind is the opportunity for international experiences – hopefully there is a lot of people on this webinar tonight that are interested in travelling overseas and hopefully COVID sorts itself out. So for me, I got the opportunity to go to over to New York for 2 months and intern full time there. I was interning on Wall Street and living in Brooklyn and it was just an unbelievable experience and ever since that opportunity kind of happened, every job interview I have been talking about it because it really just shows a lot of independence – which you don’t really get that kind of opportunity to show elsewhere. I am also about to start an internship with an intellectual property law firm which I am super excited about. In an ideal world I would be travelling over to Malaysia, but unfortunately that’s not happening so its all virtual. UTS has done a really great job of transitioning everything online so you still get those opportunities. Following on from that UTS Careers is a really awesome resource that we have at UTS. So they kind of have like drop in sessions where you can show them resumes, cover letters and they will essentially go through it with a pen and edit it so I have gone back to this poor lady 3 or 4 times when I was going through that penultimate year internship application process and she really helped me to nail that resume to really show myself off as best I can, which was really awesome. Then the final thing that I would say Is that UTS has a really practice focus, which I really definitely noticed when I transferred from the other university that I was at – so a lot of your courses kind of revolve around developing technical skills, which is really important. So my majors marketing and working with Qualtrics and Excel, necessary evils I would say – but really important to develop those skills. Then also with my Law degree, a lot of my assignments really focussed on drafting work as if you’re delivering it to a client, which is a very difficult skill to hone in on, so they really kind of get you to do that throughout the course of your degree – which is extremely helpful, so yeah. Kenny: Could you, do you mind if you could talk more about the international opportunities, how did you get into that? Georgie: Yeah, for sure absolutely. So with the New York internship, that was organised through UTS Build, which I would really recommend to everyone who is starting at UTS to look into - it is a really awesome program that they run. Which is essentially all about developing your global mindset, about how to be a global citizen, things like cultural awareness, social justice and so as part of that program you do a series of workshops and then you also have the opportunity to build elective points and you can do that through international experiences or if you want to stay in Australia you can do more domestic experiences as well, which is really awesome and they have a huge data base of opportunities for all different degrees, which is really awesome, so yeah. Kenny: haha it’s fairly impressive. So have you been able to keep in contact with the people from Brooklyn, have you been able to network with them, you know not from a career perspective, but more so the social perspective. Georgie: Yeah, absolutely, one of the people I met at New York I actually saw last night which is pretty funny. But also career wise as well I think that’s another a really important note is developing like an international network especially if you’re someone who wants to work overseas at some point in your life. So my manager from when I was in New York, she was actually coming to Australia and I was able to kind of hook some things up for her, with UTS funny enough – yeah and it’s just really awesome seeing what’s happening overseas and keeping those connections alive and also just making those friends – yeah because you wouldn’t normally meet them in your usual day to day life I would say. Kenny: definitely. That’s really impressive, I haven’t had a chance to go on international studies yet, because I’m participating in the build program as well , but you know with Covid it’s definitely slowed down. But, hey as you said UTS has done really really well in terms of the transition from virtual to, sorry, from in-person to virtual. So I’d like to just build up on this again so Georgie I’m gonna start with you and then afterwards I’m going to move onto perhaps I will talk a little bit about my experiences here. Tell us a little bit about the extracurricular activities that you have participated in. Georgie: absolutely, so as I kind of mentioned before I got really involved in different societies as kind of a way to make friends and also to kind of figure out what I want to do with my life to be quite honest with you guys, so that was the Business Society, Women in Business, Law and the Consulting Club, which I really got heavily involved in and through that society I started competing in different case competitions which is essentially when you’re given a problem and you kind of have to solve it and then pitch it back to judges. So I entered the Microsoft protégé case competition last year with a few friends and we actually came second in Australia which was super exciting and so the laptop that I’m using right now is the one that Microsoft gave us as like a prize – so that might be a bit of incentive for anyone, so they’re a lot of fun. I also did some social sport at uni, so I started doing netball which was a lot of fun, a good way to meet different people – also learn a new skill if you haven’t played any of those sports before. I also tried to go on exchange, to the Neverland’s but that was last year so unfortunately that got cancelled, but if you guys are looking to join UTS that’s definitely something that is available to you hopefully in the future. And then the final thing is that I’ve done various internships through the course of my studies and I’ve done quite a few for academic credit – so I was like, get two birds with one stone kind of thing. So yeah that’s been kind of over the summer periods, during winter and over the actual session itself. Which has been super exciting, I got to intern with a legal tech start up, which was a lot of fun, an NGO which was very interesting and obviously about to start with this Malaysian firm – which I’m super excited about. So that’s me. Kenny: so you met the Malaysian firm through the extracurricular activities that you were participating in? Georgie: sorry can you just repeat that, my internet is going a little bit? Kenny: sorry, so you actually met the Malaysian firm through which program did you go through to meet them? Georgie: Yeah, Yeah absolutely – so within the law faculty they run international internships legal internships and they can help you kind of source different places to go through, so you can go through either the faculty or you can go through Build, so mine was again through Build, so I just had a really awesome experience with them the first time, so they kind of hooked me up with all these different opportunities and I decided that the Malaysian legal system was one that really interested me and particularly intellectual property so that’s why I went down that path. Kenny: wow, so I think we can all see that joining societies is a great way to enhance your career aspects as well. Myself, I am part of the UTS medical and health society, we do a lot of workshops for GAMSAT related events, so if you’re thinking about coming to UTS, studying medical science and possibly developing your medical science knowledge and going into medicine later on or doing research then definitely joining one of the clubs is really important, being part of the society – you actually get a lot of opportunities to network as well so with these workshop events as well, one of our more recent workshops, that’s actually happening tonight, unfortunately I couldn’t participate – but one of the recent workshops that we’re running today is actually a med career workshop, essentially where networking and engaging with doctors and students who are in medical school and you get to ask questions and see what kind of life-style they have, pretty much essentially like this but relating to med. Joining a society it is student run so you can expect that it’s very down to earth, you know everyone there has the same sort of passion as you, everyone there has the same sort of issues and all in a society I guess to enhance our own careers. Would you agree to that Georgie? Georgie: I’m so sorry you completely cut out on me, sorry Kenny Kenny: Sorry, you cut out jut then. But, yes definitely if. Coming to UTS academics isn’t really everything, myself personally I joined five societies in the first year, I really wanted to go out and get out there and make new friends, I joined Japanese, I joined Oz tag, I joined Med Soc, what else have I joined, I think I joined dance society and music society as well. It was a great experience meeting people from all diverse backgrounds and they all had different hobbies as well, so there is really no shortage of extracurricular and societies at UTS. So moving on now, uh Hannah – can you just give us some tips about balancing student work like commitments? Hannah: Yeah absolutely, I feel like I’m particularly qualified to talk about this just because Midwifery is a very intense course where you’re doing four days a week at uni and then on top of that you’re doing placements. I have two main bits of advice for balancing study, work and life commitments and I don’t think people are going to like my first one, but setting aside time, sorry not setting aside time. Starting your assignments early is one of my biggest ones. As soon as your lecturer or your tutor gives you that rundown of what that assignment actually is and how you’re going to do it. Start it then, because when that assignment creeps up on you and it’s the week that its due and your car breaks down and you know you’re suddenly sick and you need to go to hospital, things like that – you never know when those sorts of things are going to happen and so if you have that assignment done and ready earlier you cannot stress about it and you can use that week when its due to just relax and have fun and do the things you like. And the other tip I have is setting aside time to do the things that you enjoy, so if you devote time to doing the life commitments that you enjoy, say if you really like running, making sure you’re always going for a run 4pm each day, or if you, you know like sports or want to do an art class make sure that you do that every Friday evening. Things like that, if you devote time to that, then let uni work around that as opposed to working around doing your uni work. Kenny: yeah, that’s a great way to put it, definitely I agree – I definitely agree to that. How about you Georgie? How do you manage your time? What sorts of tips can you offer? Georgie: This has been a constant struggle for me over the past 5 years. I think for me the first thing I would say is make sure you kind of know yourself and what you can manage. Me personally I like to work a lot but as a result full time study can be a bit difficult so I think accumulatively I have spent about 3 years doing 3 subjects per semester and then doing study over the Summer period to try keep myself on track with my cohort which is a really good way to do it and its something that I have actually enjoyed. Summer school it sounds a bit boring but its actually a really good way to learn. I feel like it’s a lot more positive in the Summer time, everyone is just a bit happier. But then following on from that – and this is a bit nerdy, but I really love Google calendar to organise my life and keep myself structured and accountable putting in all of my assignment dates etc. and so forth, when I am working, when I am seeing friends – its like a very visual way to see what your week ahead looks like. That would be the other thing that I recommend. Kenny: I cant agree more. I think time management is very very important and for myself, I don’t use Google calendar but I do have a physical calendar – the UTS diary – this is pretty much what I live by. I plan out my day, I plan out my week and at times I would even, you know, when the semester starts – I think the biggest help for me has been planning out my entire semester and seeing what my schedule is like. I really think to go back to the point of what Hannah said about that you shouldn’t let uni control your time – am I saying that right? Hannah: Absolutely! Kenny: You shouldn’t be you know switching up your time for university, you definitely want to be able to focus on yourself. University is just another aspect of your life and that is what you should really focus on – you have to think about the bigger picture. Hannah: Yeah and you don’t want to like however long your course is to be just a step to where you want to be, you want to enjoy the time you’re at uni. Kenny: Definitely yeah. You can lose sight of where you want to get to, but you have to enjoy the process. I think I have a question for both of you, do you think is it possible to work as well as studying? Hannah: Yes! Georgie: Absolutely! Hannah: We are doing that at the moment, so I feel that yes it is. Kenny: It is Georgie: I feel like most people are in that situation where they are working and studying in whatever capacity it may be – without a doubt doable. Hannah: Yeah I moved out of my parents house so I kind of have to work to pay rent and you know eat food but yeah its definitely possible even you know if your uni is at 9 – 12pm you can work casual from 1 – 3pm or just find time around to do that. Kenny: I actually had a question Georgie, you said you were only doing 3 courses for a semester – are you still considered a full time student then? Georgie: Yep you sure are. I think its 18 credit points and you are still full time. So I did look into that because I wanted to make sure that I still kept my concession opal card because I didn’t want to pay adult rates – but yeah you are still full time. Kenny: Yep and that’s one of the ways you have been able to manage studying, doing extra-curricular activities and working all at the same time Georgie: Yeah absolutely, if I was doing 4 subjects I don’t think I would have made it. I genuinely would have burnt out. You just wouldn’t be able to do your best in yours subjects, or intern or work or whatever it is you’re pursuing at that time Kenny: Alison, this is actually a question for you – would a year of study at another institution be counted at UTS? Or would a student have to start from the beginning? Alison: Most definitely. All the studies completed at another institution would account to assessing your actual eligibilities into any of the courses at UTS. So what happens is, you put in your application and you would also put in your transcripts or submit information on the courses you have commenced then UAC will assess your studies completed based on the results you achieved during your studies. UTS will then consider all studies completed and then you will be assessed for your eligibility based on your best rank. If you have been completing a similar course at another institution you can also apply for recognition of prior learning which I touched on earlier and that would be once you accept your offer into your course. If you are eligible for any subjects completed then the relevant subjects would be credited into your study plan so then you would have to re-do the same subjects. So most definitely you don’t have to start from scratch. Kenny: And sorry, just to confirm the recognition of prior learning, is it done through UAC or directly to the university? Alison: It is done directly with UTS Kenny: Directly to UTS. Could you also explain what the STAT test is? Alison: So the STAT test I touched on earlier as well. So it is one of the pathways into UTS. So many courses at UTS will consider the STAT test which is the multiple choice version which is administered by the Australian Council for Educational Research. One of the conditions is that you have to be 20 years of age by the 1st of March for the year of admission. So for this year you would have needed to be 20 by the 1st of March this year and your STAT results would have needed to be attained within the last 3 years prior to admission. Sorry that looks like a slightly different question to me, cons would be if you don’t meet those eligibility requirements but pros are if the results you have attained from your other qualifications don’t quite meet the requirements then it is an alternate pathway for you to consider. Kenny: Excellent Alison: Yep Kenny; So how does a diploma, STAT test, year of uni compare to those students who are applying with ATARs? Alison: Yep, so what generally happens when you submit your qualifications to UAC all of the qualifications you have studied or commenced are converted into a qualification rank by UAC for assessment so regardless of whether it is a diploma, STAT test or a year of uni or at another institution they will all be converted into different ranks. So lets say you have done your HSC, you have done a year of study – half a year of study at another institution and you have also done the STAT test – I don’t think anyone really does all of those. Any one that you have done and submitted and declared your studies, they would be converted into a rank. So at the end of the day once UAC has done all of the assessments, then you would be considered for entry into your UTS course based on your most competitive which is your best rank. So because of that reason you should always declare all of your studies in your UAC application even if you didn’t complete. Kenny: Excellent! Well that actually concludes our panellist event for this webinar, but we are opening up 1-1 live chats right now . I believe one of our staff members will be submitting a link in the chat so please go onto to that and we will get typing. So that’s where we will be answering all of your questions!

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/business-courses/postgraduate-business-options/why-postgraduate-study,"The reasons for postgraduate study are as diverse as our students but include career progression, change and security and running your own business. Why choose UTS, why now is the right time and connect with us about your next steps. Perhaps you already have a recent undergraduate degree in the field. You may be eligible to gain exemptions on introductory core subjects to help you accelerate your course and advance your skills, or perhaps head into more strategic management roles with one of our Management or MBA programs. Never studied business before? That’s OK. From graduate certificates to master degrees, our programs allow you to gain the essential knowledge to transition into business leadership from any background. Don’t get left behind by technology or advances in practice. Keep yourself up-to-date and your skillset relevant with options ranging from individual subjects (non-award study) to full master degrees. Ever dreamt of launching your own enterprise? Or perhaps you just want to think more entrepreneurially within your current organisation. Either way, studying Entrepreneurship is a unique solution to give you the knowledge, skills and confidence you need. Whether it's been a while since you have studied, or this is the first time you have explored business options at uni, you may have a number of questions or concerns. Check out answers to common questions that help take the mystery out of postgraduate business study with UTS Business School. Webinar: Postgraduate Business Options Presented by Samantha Nugent, Marketing Officer. Featuring Sara Denize, Associate Dean (Education) What are my postgraduate study options? Sam Nugent So, to get started, we'll chat a little bit about all of our postgraduate courses. A question we get asked a lot is, ""What course do you think I should study?"" Or ""What's the difference between an MBA?"" or one of our specialist programs. Sam Nugent So, I guess to give a brief overview. We've got two MBA programs that we split into one group, and then the other group being our specialist courses. So, our MBA, we've got two MBAs, we've got the Executive MBA and our standard MBA. So, our standard MBA is made up of 16 subjects, the first six subjects are core subjects. So, you'll learn really the pillars of how business works. So accounting, management, economics, and so on and so forth, to really get an understanding of how business works. And with the remaining 10 subjects, you will get to pick either a major, and a sub major, or some electives or a couple of sub majors, it's entirely up to you and where your interests lie, but you can see that there's really half a page of majors available there. So, it really just depends on what your interests are in. So, you could do a major in HR, and then if you're interested in IT, and an IT sub major, for example, so that you're getting that, that blend, or yeah, it's very flexible and entirely up to you. 01:34 Our Executive MBA we're really excited about. It's a new program that launched halfway through last year. So, this program is designed for professionals that have at least six years managerial work experience, and how this program works is it's also split up into core subjects, and then what we call streams, as well as electives. But the core subjects are really focused on while they do cover all the foundation areas of business, they will really apply that information such as accounting, and how you would then make managerial decisions with accounting in mind, and less. So, how accounting works, even though that's briefly covered. And then there are three streams within the executive MBA that you can see. So, there's the corporate transformation stream, which has a big focus on change management, and not just how to handle change management, but then how to actually execute it into a business as well as our entrepreneurship stream. So, if you have a business idea, we encourage you to bring this forward to the program. And you'll actually use your real-life business model to apply to this entrepreneurship stream. So, it's very hands on, especially with your own business, and then the indigenous nation building stream, which covers management from an indigenous perspective, which was really interesting. 03:01 So, did you want to talk through if you have anything to add to our programs? 03:06 Yeah, I think a question we get a lot of Sam is, ""Well, should I do an MBA or an executive MBA? And how do I make that decision?"", and I'll talk about the specialist programs and in a moment we get to them but, I think if you've done a non-business undergraduate degree, and you're or you're coming from a non you're working in, say engineering or nursing, the MBA is the program for you is the Generalist Business Program. 03:35 The real strength of the Master of Business Administration, it allows you to get that general business information in the core subjects and the in the six core subjects. But then it gives you plenty of space to focus in on one or two key areas which might reflect the industry that you want to work in or might reflect a specific skill set that you'd like to develop. And I think it really brings together the best of both worlds for those that don't have an undergraduate business qualification. It's it's a great program with heaps of flexibility, which will enable you to create a career pathway for yourself. It's very much designed as an early and mid-career program, whereas the EMBA, is very much designed for someone who's wanting to take the next step to senior levels in their career. And they will have been working for some time and in management roles and want to move or advanced, potentially that sort of high, mid high mid middle management or C suite of positions. And they're designed in different ways to support different types of where people are at with their careers. And they're both very career focused programs but they represent different sorts of positioning. So, I think the NBA is really be good for someone who's maybe got a professional qualification in a another domain, who now whatever now moving into management, whereas someone who's already in management and wants to go the next levels would be the executive MBA. 05:14 Yeah, I completely agree. Thank you for that. 05:18 So, if you wouldn't mind just talking through, we have a whole suite of Specialist Programs. 05:23 Yeah. 05:24 But just really explaining how they work. And just a couple of them maybe? 05:28 Yeah, okay. So, the next question we get a lot is, Well, ""Should I do a Specialist Degree? Or should I do an MBA with a Specialisation?"", And my answer to you is, if you're really you know, the direction of your career, and you're very clear that you're going to be in marketing or accounting and that's the sort of professional direction that you are absolutely going forward, then I would definitely say do the deep dive in a Specialist Program. 05:59 What a Specialist Program does is it, it takes you deep into the knowledge and skills for that area of specialisation. So, if you're already working in marketing, for example, as a marketing officer, and you wanted to advance to a marketing manager or looking at senior management in marketing, then you would definitely do a Master of Marketing rather than an MBA per se, with a specialisation in marketing. So, these, that's why you would choose a specialist program. 06:28 If you've done an undergraduate degree in business, and you're wanting to add another specialisation to your portfolio, so you did an Undergraduate Degree in Accounting, and you find you're now working in banks, and you really need some finance background, then you would do the Master of Finance, and add that to your portfolio. So, if you know the career direction, choose this now. 06:50 Some of the exciting things that I think, well, they're all great programs, but and I can tell you 1001 reasons why you should choose each of them. But I'm going to pick some real, really, I think, really important areas for you to consider at the moment: Supply Chain Management. The world has changed dramatically. And if you're looking for a new career, as you couldn't, you could hardly go past supply chain. There's such a shortage of people with supply chain specialists, specialist knowledge, looking at logistics, looking at the kind of data and analytics and planning skills that come with the fully accredited Supply Chain Program. You'll notice that in that there's been a huge growth in job opportunities and Human Resource management, so another fully accredited program. 07:42 I'm excited about Behavioural Economics. It's a relatively new program that we launched just on 18 months ago. And it represents a new way of thinking about behaviour, individual and corporate behaviour and decision making. And it really is being used by governments and large organisations to solve very specific thorny problems. 08:05 I'm excited about Event Management, our program and event management's just really looking at how we respond to and do things very differently in the context of a global marketplace for events that's transformed massively with the increase in virtual events happening. So, there's a whole new skill set that we're developing in that program, and our graduates are really sought after by employers in that sector. 08:32 Another thing I'll mention about the courses as well, that I get asked quite often is you don't need any prior knowledge. So, if you're currently working in an area, and you're looking to go into Marketing, or HR, for example, but you've never studied them, and you have no work experience, that's completely fine. You, we start from the ground up with information. So definitely not something to worry about. There's no pre bridging courses or anything like that you'll that you'll need to do you can come straight in and essentially learn from the ground up. And people often find that even if they don't know much about the area, they've never studied it, there's so much they can draw from their either past studies or work experience into the course, much more familiar than they initially thought. 09:17 And we've got a plan for helping support you through to the masters that you want that your objective is. So, there's 1001 pathways into our programs. 09:27 Absolutely. 09:29 Sorry, the big question that I know that you are facing a lot at the moment, is because of COVID restrictions, there's been a lot of changes over the last couple of years. We were predominantly a face-to-face University or an on-campus University. And there's been a big shift and a lot of ambiguity around what teaching involves. 09:51 Can you chat to maybe, how some of the subjects being run and maybe, what the future looks like for the Business School? 09:57 Going forward in postgraduate space, we very much seeing that our postgraduate students want to have the flexibility of a mix of subjects, some on campus, face to face so that they can build networks and so forth and other subjects where they can manage their life, but work life balance and study life balance a little bit more effectively. 10:21 We're seeing that our postgraduate students are choosing a portfolio of online and on campus. What we're doing is developing individual plans for each of our courses so that we can tell you what you can expect for the NBA or the Executive MBA or the Master of Finance. And the faculty are working on those at the moment for spring, for next session. There'll be will absolutely be a mix of on campus and online classes and options available. We're still in that phase where more of the activities will be online, simply because we know that many of our students are actually grappling with really complex contexts at home, and still looking after and caring for vulnerable people. And so, we're trying to make sure that as we get through the last, the tail end of this, this pandemic, that we're still continuing to provide the support we need. 11:18 We expect that next year, there'll be a lot more on campus and a lot more clarity about each of the different programs. But if you've got a specific program in mind, I think it's probably we can answer the question for that program. It's hard to generalise at this point, Sam, as you know. 11:36 So, ""What does it mean in terms of in terms of learning?"", 11:39 Well, we do use, we obviously will continue to have face to face activities, they are a big part and if we're not able to offer all of the subjects, we'll certainly be offering some subjects on campus in the normal kind of delivery format, which was typically a seminar for a postgraduate course. But we will offer some classes in a live zoom session and we'll we will be encouraging you to turn your cameras on and talk to us and be part of the conversation. And I think this is really important our employee groups that we're working with the saying that this is the norm for business. This is the way actually businesses are operating much more with a lot more interaction by teams and zoom and so we're really happy that we're able to provide an experience for our students in that context as well. To build team-based skills in virtual settings as well as face to face settings. 12:35 We will create a wide range of networking and extracurricular opportunities and I've got to say I've worked at a number of Universities in Sydney at the moment. And our extra-curricular portfolio of resources that are available to all of our students, postgraduate students specifically, exceptional with everything from writing essays, language support, through to helping you prepare for job interviews, resume writing, repositioning your resume redesigning your career, at really important workshops and co-curricular opportunities. There's also a huge range of internship opportunities that are available for our postgraduate students as well. 13:21 So, within our master’s Programs we have built nested within them, we have a graduate certificate in each of our courses, our Graduate Diploma in all of our courses besides Behavioural Economics, and Professional Accounting, and then their master's and extension masters for a few of our courses. 13:41 So, the reason we highlight this is because, in order to study a postgraduate degree, you don't have to have an undergraduate degree, which is a question that we ask a lot and definitely want to address as well. So, if you have four years of full time or equivalent work experience, you're eligible to apply for our graduate certificate programs. Now, there's, as I said, a nested within the within the masters and a made up of the first 24 credit points. So, if you enter via a graduate certificate, it doesn't take any more time or you're not repeating any more subjects or cost anymore, and you are sitting in classes with those doing anyone from the graduate certificate through to the extension masters as well. It's simply an admission pathway. So, it's definitely worth considering if you don't have an undergraduate degree, we really encourage you to reach out to myself or submit an application and just demonstrate that through your resume. 14:43 So... sorry, assessments. People want to know if there's group work or is it exams or what's your... 14:52 It's all of the above, but what we try to do is offer in any degree a mix of individual assessment tasks, a mix of tasks that are written and verbally presented, a mix of group and individual work. And we have some exams. Certain disciplines tend to have certain specific assessment modes. For example, the accounting profession do require that we have particular types of assessments as part of the professional accreditation requirements for that course. 15:28 So, there are some differences by degree, but all of the above, assessments tend to be the beginning of the session, something in the middle and something at the end of a session in a subject. Some subjects have one big assessment, which will be a major project. So for example, internships, and there's a lot of our capstone courses have a major piece of assessment that you would do. Often, if it's a really big project, you would do that with a with a group. But a lot of the assessments are also individual assessments. So, it's a range. 16:07 Through a rule of thumb, we typically say it's about an hour and a half of study time per hour of contact time. That's the general rule of thumb. But if you're working in finance, and you're coming to do a Master of Finance. I mean, really, there's a good chance that you won't need to study as much for the subjects that you have a strong affiliation with. And for myself, for a subject I did with Usara, I hadn't done a lot of that analytical piece before. So, it was definitely a lot longer than that. So, it really does depend on your background. But can you offer any advice around that? 16:46 I guess the question is, ""How much should you do in your first session of study?"" 16:52 If you're working full time, I would absolutely say for your first session of study, if you're able to, to just take a part time load, that would be the right thing to do. So, take one or two subjects in your first session and if you're an international student, you will be studying full time and you'll need to take four subjects in each half year. Four subjects as a full-time load, so it's equivalent to working full time except it might not take you that amount of time. If you've got some background, or you're working in that area, as you said, Sam, 17:25 So, if you are not an international student, and you have no visa requirements, you can choose anywhere between one and four subjects, as Sara said, so the difference between core and elective subjects. Sarah, can you walk us through that, please. So, what we do is we identify the things that we think are essential for every student to know if they're going to graduate with a particular course, what we do is we say these courses, these subjects are absolutely essential for you to graduate with an MBA or a master's in finance. And those subjects that we call core are often linked to specific professional requirements, or specific knowledge that has been demonstrated to be really important with that particular degree. And then what we do is we introduce what we call electives. And there where students can have a bit more free choice and a bit of flexibility to tailor their particular course, to their specific learning needs. So, for example, in the Master of Marketing, 17:40 So, the difference between core and elective subjects. Sarah, can you walk us through that, please. 17:42 So, what we do, is we identify the things that we think are essential for every student to know if they're going to graduate with a particular course, what we do is we say these courses, these subjects are absolutely essential for you to graduate with an MBA or a Master's in Finance. And those subjects that we call core are often linked to specific professional requirements, or specific knowledge that has been demonstrated to be really important with that particular degree. And then what we do is we introduce what we call electives, and there where students can have a bit more free choice and a bit of flexibility to tailor their particular course, to their specific learning needs. 18:25 So, for example, in the Master of Marketing. We've got quite a lot of electives. There’re some standard core subjects that are essential, but there's a lot of opportunity for choice and flexibility. And this is because if you've done a degree in marketing, you can go into so many different careers, very, very different careers, and you get to choose the electives that will suit your career plans. In the MBA, as we've said, the six core subjects that cover all of the general business knowledge that you must have to bring you up to appropriate skill levels in a business management job. And then we have got lots of electives, for flexibility. 19:11 Whereas in the Master of Professional Accounting, there's really no electives at all. It's all core unless you do the extension program and then you can choose for electors. 19:20 And 19:21 So, I'll now walk everyone through actually recognition of prior learning. Sorry we'll talk about recognition of prior learning first. We've had a few phase questions, and we will move on to that shortly. 19:33 So, recognition of prior learning will really depend on the program that you're applying for. So, you can see that the more subjects that you're looking to complete, the more recognition of prior learning that you can obtain. How this works is it has to be equivalent to the subject that you're looking to receive credit recognition for. So, in your undergraduate if you're doing an MBA for example, and in your undergraduate degree, you've done an accounting course subject, and it's within a 10-year timeframe, you can absolutely apply for recognition of prior learning. For example, the accounting course object within the MBA. So, it really works as one for one. So, what you need to do is obtain subject outlines for your past studies and compare them to the subjects that you're looking to receive credit for. And then you can submit that to our recognition of prior learning team, and they'll assess that. But it does have to be within a 10-year timeframe. And you can see generally what the possible exemptions are based on what course you're looking to apply for. 20:39 So, our fee calculator, it can be a little bit difficult to work. But here's really a step by step. So how it works is you need to put in either postgraduate domestic or postgraduate International, the fee year, so the year in which you're looking to study and the cobalt year, they're looking at the year in which you're looking to commence and then Coursera being business and then you have to type in the full program name. So, you know Master of Marketing or so on and so forth, is no abbreviations unfortunately. And then when you search that up, so for example, for the Master of Business Administration, this is what would come up. So how it works is the MBA is made up of 96 credit points in total. So, for all 16 subjects and each credit point is $703. So, for the total cost of the program, it will be 67,488, not including some student service fees, which are about 75 to $140 a year, which are added on. That how you would work it out per credit point or per subject would be, so in most of our postgraduate programs are subject is worth six credit points, but it can be three or 12. So you would need to have a look at the handbook for how the subjects are credited there. So, you would simply times 703 If you're doing the MBA by six, which would give you the amount per subject. 22:15 So how things work is, if you are enrolling in two subjects, you'll be upon enrolling, you'll then receive an E-invoice through to your student email just for those two subjects that you're enrolling in. So, you're not charged the full course fees upfront. It's simply for what you're enrolling in for that session. And if you receive recognition of prior learning, then of course, the amount of credit points that have been deducted through RPL will be taken off the final amount. 22:45 Things I would add is if you're an Australian domestic student, all of our postgraduate courses attract a fee help. I think that's mentioned on your slide there saying 22:54 Yes 22:55 So that can really help with budgeting for international students. I think the big thing to remember is you only pay for what you're studying this current session. So, we don't make you pay up front like they do in Europe, where you have to pay for the whole course upfront the whole year. So, it's a sort of pay as you go model and for fee help. 23:14 So, if you are an Australian citizen, and you haven't obtained over $120,000 in student debt, then how it works is when you go to enrol in your subjects, that all happens automatically within the University. And it does work the same as a HECS debt, so payments are deferred. And then you repay those based on a threshold of what you earn. So, we can send you more information on that as well. 23:42 So, moving on now, to ""What your year will look like,"" 23:46 What the year looks like, so most of our postgraduate courses that we offer in three sessions, so an Autumn session, which runs from sort of mid-February, through to the end of May, June, mid-June, and then a Spring Session that runs through from sort of August through to November. And then we do have some subjects available over Summer. But most mostly most of the classes are available in Spring and Autumn and you can choose if you want to participate in a Summer Session to advance your degree more quickly, or to take that session off. As I've mentioned earlier, if you're working full time, we definitely suggest that you do a couple of subjects each session and maybe so that would be four subjects, two an Autumn, two in Spring and then maybe pick up one subject in Summer. 24:44 For an international student, you would normally do four subjects in Autumn and four subjects in Spring and a lot of our international students take Summer off and take advantage of that the work opportunities that are available to them in Australia over the Summer vacation period. Others of our international students tend to sometimes take a lighter session and one of the Autumn and Spring and add in one or two subjects in Summer, to keep their full-time length. As an international student, you need to complete eight subjects a year. But that's a calendar year, not an academic year. 25:23 The Executive MBA and the Master of Behavioural Economics is on a bit of a different calendar, and we've done this so that students can do one subject at a time basically, and so they will do a six, six credit points at a time. So, you'll do a total of six subjects, the equivalent of six, six credit points subjects a year, but you'll spread that over as shorter, more intense study sessions, and you've studied and one of those six session blocks. And that means you've kind of focused for us for six weeks. 26:02 Yeah, 26:03 but then you're only doing one thing. 26:06 And another thing I would note is just the census dates. So, these dates is when you become financially liable for the subjects that you've enrolled in so you do have up until this date. So, if you start, if you have the flexibility in order to choose how many subjects you wish to enrol in, and you've picked three, and maybe it's a bit intense, you do, you can drop down back to 2 or, or so on and so forth. But you just need to make sure that you're checking the census date. 26:36 So, it's the date, which once you've definitely committed to doing the subject, and it's the date at which you're not only financially liable, but also academically liable. So, if you withdraw after the census date, it will show on your academic record. 26:53 Touching on sorry, you mentioned before, all the great resources we have through the University, and UTS Careers where people can find support. Another piece I would mention is prior to session commencing you would have seen on the academic date, just then we've had a week of orientation. If you haven't studied in some time or haven't studied at a university before or even if you're coming through from undergrad to post grad, we highly recommend registering for all of our orientation activities. They'll walk you through how to use the University campus tours so it can be a really great opportunity to sort of understand and really prepare yourself for the session ahead. Sarah, do you mind touching on either any of our support services or the global alumni network? I know that that's a big case for a lot of people. 27:46 Look, first of all, absolutely join the Postgraduate Business Society. It's a great networking tool and there's a very active group of postgraduate students who lead that society we definitely encourage you to get involved. There are a range of scholarships that are available that Sam can provide you specific information about those. It does depend on course; on what course you are and in if your domestic and international student. There's a whole raft of different sorts of scholarships. So that's a one-on-one type of question. 28:24 The UK support services are amazing. So, there's what we call UTS helps and essentially, it has been a while that since you studied and I remember the first time I went back to studying after being away for a long time, I hadn't thought about how to write an exam. And that helps services can help you think through how to write an exam, if you go to the library, they have absolutely amazing support. The big thing that a lot of students mentioned to me is they read the assignment description and they just have no idea what like the lecture is even talking about. And they've asked the lecturer what that means, and they don't feel like they understand any better. The library's amazing. They'll sit down and go through the assignment question with you and help you understand the question and help you find the types of resources that you need. There's a huge array of enormously well-connected alumni who are part of and continuing part of the learning experience at UTS. So, there'll be opportunities for you to join LinkedIn groups to join alumni networks, to meet our alumni and to network with those groups. 29:39 I just see there's a question that's popped up about opportunities to network with students and industry partners. Absolutely. You will see this in every one of our courses. 29:50 A lot of the ways that we get you to do this is actually to do real projects to do projects that are actually provided by employers and our industry partners who are coming into the classroom to code deliver our curriculum. But there are a range of networking events. But we've always had a really strong focus on making sure that our postgraduate students are able to access our research and industry research seminars and our sort of master classes and things like that. So, there's a wide range of networking opportunities that happened with our academy as it were, and the way they interact with our industry partners. If you are interested in those sorts of networking opportunities, reach out to the course director, the program, what we call someone's program director, the director for the NBA or the director for the Master Professional Accounting, or the Director for the Master of Finance, and you say you want to come to the industry research events. And you'll there's literally this on every week at one our other part of the Business School. 30:55 So, for our last most frequently asked question, I'll walk through domestic applications. To apply as a postgraduate domestic student is free. You apply directly to the university, and you'll need three main pieces of information in order to fully submit your application. So, you will need an up-to-date resume, I typically recommend to people what your LinkedIn page looks like is really perfect, and outline of your work history to show how long you've been in the workforce. Any transcripts or certificates or test hammers or anything that you can obtain, as well. So, your educational history is really important to submit as well. And then what we call a statement of service. So, we have a template for this that you can find on the applications page and one that we can also send out if that's required. It's not a letter of recommendation, it's a just a page, a one pager that really, you get a manager or if you own your own business and accountant to sign just to state how long you've been in your current role. So, you don't need to have this signed for every single role you've ever been in just for your current role. 32:11 If you aren't looking to advise your work, that you're going back to study, that's completely fine. You can have a justice of the peace sign or someone from the post office, sign your resume as a stack deck instead. So, there are a couple of different options there. And then you just upload these documents onto our application portal. And they are submitted to our admissions team. The turnaround time is roughly two to three weeks when it's really busy, but otherwise, much shorter than that. So, it's a very quick process. It's all done online. And it's free. 32:48 If you have any questions or you would like to set up a call with myself or someone on my team, you can email: business@uts.edu.au. It comes straight through to myself. So please do reach out if we can help with anything at all. And if you just want to have a look at what the application process looks like or looking to apply, or really anything that we've spoken about today, you can access it all via PG business uts.edu.au. 33:14 Thank you, Sara so much for your expertise. We really appreciate it. Not every day that we've got Associate Dean's jumping on webinars. 33:23 So yeah, my pleasure. It's great to meet you all. I look forward to seeing you on campus at some point.

Read on … According to the Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching, the median salary for master degree holders in 2022 was $103,000, 32% higher than those with a bachelor degree. The sooner you do it, the more time you have for it to be paying dividends. The average Australian changes jobs every 3.3 years and will have 5 careers in their lifetime. The ticket to you being in control of this is having the skills, networks and confidence that are the unique hallmarks of postgraduate education. Think a bachelor degree is enough? Over the past decade, over 1.29 million Australians completed an undergraduate degree. Over the same time, postgraduate completions grew by 36%. Furthermore, a survey of graduate outcomes found that 90% of Australians who completed a postgraduate Business or Management degree found full time employment within four months of completion, over 12% higher than the average for undergraduate degree holders. To compete in today’s professional landscape, postgraduate qualifications are almost a prerequisite. Do you know you can defer paying your postgraduate fees in the same way as your undergraduate tuition fees? FEE HELP is the government loan initiative that covers Australian postgraduate student fees, where you pay it back according to your income. If you have a previous degree from UTS, you can now save 10% on fees for postgraduate UTS courses. UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands. We would also like to pay respect to the Elders both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for these lands.

I previously worked for the Metropolitan Aboriginal Land Council, which was a great experience, I love working in grassroots. Before that, I actually worked here at UTS at Jumbunna for several years, and I'm happy to be back here at UTS working with the students. Thank you. 02:40 I'm Scott Walker, I'm the Director of the BBA and I also teach in the program. As director, I help students manage any academic issues that might arise. I've been at UTS for a number of years and teach a large first year undergraduate finance subject, lecture theatres with often over 300 students. I've taught a finance subject and the BBA for the past two years, I really enjoyed the close connection that's possible with the small class sizes. 03:09 My name is Dean and my family is from Queensland and New South Wales. I've got people from Wooloowin and my family, but also from up in the Gumbaynggirr area up in the Far North Coast. I've been at the UTS now since 2010. I also did my Masters here. And then I did my PhD here as well at the Business School in the Management discipline group. I teach in a couple of modules, module two, and module four, which I'll talk a little bit more about later. 03:43 Now with the BBA, we have such a diverse cohort with the students from all over Australia, who are undertaking the degree, there's students from Torres Strait, WA, Victoria, and throughout New South Wales and Queensland country and regional centres. So what we've got is a couple of our students and alumni to chat to you about what they've found good about the program, the structure of the BBA and what works in their personal circumstances. 04:11 So my name is Koorinya Moreton. I'm a proud of Yuin and Bundjalung woman. I'm currently living on the south coast of New South Wales and in my first year of the BBA, I work at the Department of Education New South Wales as a Policy Officer. 04:26 My name is Terri, I'm a proud Wuthathi and Mariu woman residing on Yuggera country here in Brisbane. I currently work to the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources in the Business Grants Hub. I've previously worked across communities in Arnhem Land and Cape York as well. I am in my first year of the BBA and so far, I'm enjoying it. 04:53 Hello, everyone. I'm Sara Hamilton. I'm a Gamilaraay woman. But I was born and raised on Gadigal country around Redfern, Waterloo and Alexandria. I'm currently working as a Senior Project Officer at Aboriginal Affairs working on Kimball Wiley, a project based in Whalan in Western Sydney to support young Aboriginal people to transition from school to further education, training and employment. I graduated in 2019. I started the course in 2015, with the initial cohort, and in the last two years, basically spread the last year of the course over two years and eventually graduated in 2019. 05:41 Now, Robynne, first up, why is the BBA such an important program. 05:47 The Bachelor of Business Administration is a great program for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are working and want to increase the knowledge about business, you might take that knowledge into government, into corporations into community organizations or into running your own business. And you get a really good foundation and in depth understanding of finance, economics, accounting, marketing, and management covers the breadth of really important business knowledge. The wonderful thing about the Bachelor of Business Administration as well as that you come in over working full time, you come in six times a year for six days, working with other Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander colleagues. So you're working on the business knowledge, on gaining that knowledge, but also on projects that can be really tailored to the issues that affect us, as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, that the business issues you want to think about, the social issues you want to think about, and working together with colleagues in a practical sense on that knowledge and applying it. 07:01 As we've discussed already, the BBA is a block mode program. Six one week blocks a year, run Monday to Saturday 9am to 5pm. They give you an awesome opportunity to mix with your cohort of students, your lecturers and support staff, such as the support staff in Jumbunna. To talk more about what you're going to learn in the BBA, I'd like you to introduce, I'd like to introduce you to Scott Walker, who is the Director of the BBA and also lecturer on the program. 07:40 So block mode is great because it allows students to be 100% focused on their studies, while they're on campus. I'm sure that means that each of those one week blocks can be intense. But the advantage is that many of the assessment tasks are done while you're on campus, which minimize this amount of group work that you need to do once you're back home. 08:04 So thanks, Scott, for that. Look, the benefits of the block mode is, as Scott said, there's a number of things. But I really like the fact that you can, you know, the BBA, the way it's structured, understands your commitment outside of the, you know, outside of UTS, we understand that you have the family commitments, you have, you know, community commitment, you have your own personal commitments that you need to attend to, and the BBA can sort of slot in and around your life, if you're gonna let it, I think that's a real advantage that also allows you to continue to work. So I think that they're the key advantages of the BBA, and certainly something that is very inbuilt in the way it's delivered. 08:51 Working in the modules, and has been really beneficial to have I guess, a balanced work, life and study, sorry, balance works and study life. And I think even in the first block, when we were actually on campus, it really presented the opportunity to be totally switched off from work. I know, it's easy to sort of, you can sort of do the same studying online, but you're really physically away from work. So that's been beneficial. Um, I think I'll leave it at that. 09:38 And what kind of content do students learn in the BBA in blocks? 09:45 Yeah, so each of the six modules develop a specific management skill. For example, Robynne's already mentioned that Dean teaches in several modules, such as Managing People and Managing Operations. I'll teach you module three, that develops and manages financial and accounting skills. The final module, module six, which is also the most exciting, is all about managing a business's innovation and developing a new business opportunity. 10:15 And one of the subjects I teach is Understanding Organizations and the subject's, a theory based subject that looks at how organisations run, manage, and how organisational structures are put together, and we look at those organisational structures and organisational theory through, hopefully, through an Indigenous perspective. And so we then, and my subject is one of three or four subjects in managing organisations. And there's Understanding Organisations, there's Advocacy and Social Change. There's Sustainable Value Creation. And then there's the project subject. And the project subject is like a combination of those three other subjects where we come together with a single project and look at the, bringing all those learnings into that subject. And so, you will have other teachers for the other subjects, and we work together to deliver the whole module to you collectively. 11:26 Scott, can you tell us a little bit about the academics that teach on the BBA program? 11:31 The lecturing team are among the best teachers in the UTS Business School. While each lecturer is a subject matter expert, they have proven talent for explaining quite complex concepts in an understandable way. Lecturers also have a real passion for their subject, so much so that some of them have been involved from the very start, in the BBA, all of us thoroughly enjoy the interaction that's possible with this small class sizes, and get a real sense of satisfaction when a student, you know, gets a difficult concept. Lecturers are regularly monitoring each student's progress during the block, there's nowhere to hide in the classroom. 12:17 Now, prior tertiary study isn't a requirement for the admission into the course. Scott, from an academic perspective, how hard is the course for students coming into the program who haven't done any previous study? 12:32 Um, well, there's no denying that studying any university degree can be challenging, but UTS offers plenty of support for all students along the journey. So before admission, what you will do is complete a few tests just to confirm your level of literacy and numeracy skills. And then once you're enrolled, we found that BBA students learn really well from each other. So when you're on campus during block, the lecturers are really encouraging and give plenty of time for collaborative learning and opportunities to ask questions, Jumbunna also offers a range of student services, including their popular literacy support. Remember, though, if during the degree you do feel it's becoming too difficult, then don't forget that during second year, there are certain points where you can exit with a diploma rather than the full three year bachelor's degree. But, however, remember that many of our past students have overcome all sorts of life events, always remained completed, always remained committed to completing the full degree. 13:39 Pre-learning isn't essential, but you know, some experience is critical, I think, in my own experience, I did a block my degree and it was, you know, after many years of break from academic work, so, it took me a while to get into a rhythm of study, took me a while to start to get on top of the matter and the content that we were looking at learning and researching. So, it takes a little bit of time to adjust to a new way of thinking, sometimes you may consider it like a new language, but it really isn't. It's just a matter of acclimatising yourself, making sure that you get to know the content and do the readings and talk to classmates. You know, the process is a collaborative one. And I always say to my students, you know, I don't only teach in this subject, I also learn in this subject. And I learn from you as students because that is the exact experience that we're trying to bring to, not only to work to academia, and not the other way around. So I think that, yeah, there's some, you know, critical things that you need to know and you've done them, you'll do them through the exam process, but other than that, you know, your experience is fine. 15:04 What are some of the ways in which we support our students at UTS? 15:09 So look, the the best support we offer is a clear line of communication. We're very open to direct communication. Students are encouraged to contact their academic staff, or Tom or Scott or myself if they have any concerns. Outside of the Business School, UTS offers a range of services for students through the Student Services Unit, including financial assistance and advice, GP's and counselors. Jumbunna Institute offers academic assistance and tutoring under the ITAS program, and general assistance to do with your course administration. They also provide a student's space with computers and printing, a kitchen to make a snack or a cuppa, and some social activities. The university also has a gym, and sporting and social clubs with Activate UTS, if you want to do something outside of your studies. Plus, you'll be notified of any social justice discussions or activities happening at UTS. Thank you, that's all. 16:24 So I'm based down on the south coast of New South Wales. But I found that the BBA, and UTS more specifically, have been really supportive in terms of allowing students to be on campus six times a year for those one week blocks. We've got a really diverse cohort of students from you know, 19 to 50 year old people. And I think that adds a lot of value in terms of the conversations that take place throughout blocks. Obviously, Covid's had a big impact on us being face to face, but we're still having interactive sessions through online learning, which has also been really helpful. Yeah, I think, the flexibility, as well, has been a really important part for for me to be able to participate in this particular degree. And it's very supportive of, I guess, my personal circumstances. 17:16 I think the point that you made, and Koorinya, you made, about the diverse student cohort, what is a particular aspect of the program that I think supports students to also get, I guess, a range of different backgrounds and ideas and mingling with people from different areas of the country, and each bringing their own sort of life experience and being able to connect on similarities and differences. But I think in terms of support, I think, without the support provided by the Business School, and Jumbunna, and UTS as a university, personally, myself, I wouldn't have got through the program, being a single parent, who's also working full time and during the course at the same time, you know, the support provided by the UTS business school, by Jumbunna was, you know, was one of the things that got me through through the program. So and being you know, having the flexible, the flexibility to be able to, at the time when I was doing it, you know, coming on block mode and work at the same time, and to be able to connect with other students, whether it be through video conferencing and email in between block so that we could work together on different projects, I think in the way that it's run supports people like myself who may be working and juggling a whole different range of domains at the same time to be able to get through the program. And you know, the support mechanisms were a major aspect of what got me through it. 17:29 I've attempted to go to uni previously in a mainstream setting. And like Dean said, when you go into universities that are quite large, and it can be quite a daunting experience. So I found it really, really helpful, I guess, in this particular degree as Jumbunna taking us through and introducing us to all of the key staff and you feel like you've established relationships quite early on in the degree and that's really helpful because when you need to ask for help, you know who to go to straightaway. 19:38 Now, what are some of the resources that are available to our students to assist them in their learning? 19:43 There's a few different electronic resources and technical sort of resources that we use on the BBA program. One of them is Teams, obviously, we use Teams during class sessions. We use also Zoom as well, more so Zoom than Teams. We also electronically, we can access resources through the library, the library has a number of different resources. There's, you know, with even with your referencing, there's Refworks. There's EndNote, there's different ways that the library can help you manage your information that you use during your time at university. So, there's those technical resources that we can use, and they're available for students free of charge. Thanks. 20:39 For students who are travelling for the BBA, how are their travel and accommodation organised? 20:47 We cover the costs for all travel and accommodation needs for the students to attend blocks. 20:54 For those who want to apply for the BBA, what are their next steps? 20:58 If you're happy to go ahead, you can pop onto our website and submit an expression of interest form. Unfortunately, our office is running on a skeleton crew at the moment. But you can request a phone call and I'm happy to ring you up and have a chat at whatever time is convenient for you. You can also email us at bba@uts.edu.au. We'll get back to you. Please be assured we are definitely open for a further yarn so you can make the right decision. 21:38 What advice would you give to someone considering to do the BBA? 21:45 The BBA is very helpful, because you actually study full time, but in reality, part time. So I work full time and having the weeks off work to really commit to study has been very beneficial for me personally. It enables a healthy work life balance, and really gives me the time to dedicate and focus myself in studies. 22:20 I would encourage people to do the BBA, because, one thing, like I've mentioned before the practical aspect of it. And a lot of the subjects that we studied and a lot of the sort of assignments that we had were based on a lot of the work that we are already doing in community, or a lot of the things can be related to, I guess, community issues or community organizations or whatever it may be. So a lot of the assignments, and a lot of the subjects that we're learning about can be applied to, I guess, our everyday life experience. So and I guess, you know, the block mode aspect of it helps and helped me as a person, like I said before, who's working, has a child and I was playing sport at the time as well, to try and balance and do a university degree at the same time as juggling other work and family commitments and social commitments. But in saying that, I would say that, if you are going to commit yourself to doing this degree, you do have to commit time, to doing your assignments and to studying. It can be very easy to I guess, say, on a Friday or Saturday night, you know, I'll leave my assignment and I'll go out to the movies or I'll go to dinner or I'll go out with me mates, and think I'll do my assignment tomorrow. So I think, you know, it's three years of your life to try and commit the time to do the study and assignments that are needed to be done. But also, make sure you got that family support and the support of your work as well. I think that was an important aspect for me as well having a workplace that supported my study, and allowed me to build in study time during my work hours and gave me time away to complete assignments and to study. But I also had family members to support me, particularly my mum who would look after my daughter so that I could come home from work and do assignments and study. I would also say to people who are going to do the course, when you're in the course to absorb everything and take in as much information as you can and enjoy it while you're there. It goes quickly. And I think if I had my time again I would, I would have applied myself a lot better, even though I enjoyed and loved the experience and got a lot out of it and see some of the skills and knowledge that I learned through the program and I'm applying it in my day to day work place now. I still feel like I could have absorbed and taken more time and attention to some of the subjects. And so yeah, those are the, that's the advice that I'd give to prospective students who would come in, who are interested in studying at UTS, and studying the BBA. 25:38 I'm just gonna get it all out there. Um, I guess for first year students, it can just be an overwhelming experience in attending university. But speaking from my experience, it was comforting being in an environment where there were other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, but also public servants as well. So when learning the course content, it could be interpreted from a government lens. Plus the additional support from Jumbunna really helped and also ITAS, I found that setting appointments with my tutors really kept me accountable and, you know, enabled me to meet deadlines. And having really great lecturers as well, the course has excellent lecturers. They're very approachable. You know, if things are, you know, you've got sorry business or whatever, they're quite flexible with assessments and things like that. 26:39 Well, that brings us to the end of this webinar. I just want to take the time to thank the current students, the alumni and my colleagues in the program for taking the time to share their experiences with you, and hopefully you get the opportunity to come and share your knowledge with other students in the course.

Christian H.: What I like about it is, is it takes from so many disciplines, almost like an undergraduate version of the MBA. You get so many skill sets, and then you also start to understand what you're good at. But that opportunity to develop yourself, and then also that opportunity then to give back to your community is what inspired me to come on. Clarence S.: The fact that we get to be able to pitch ideas, and get practical experience around a lot of content. Kaitlan Cuell: I've been able to define goals, and also I've found passions and interests that I never actually knew I'd even had. Khaila-Rose P.: The fact that we are such a small group, it's been really helpful, because we can have those really robust discussions around things. Christian H.: You meet different people, be it the lecturers, be it fellow students, or even some of the enterprises that the university engages with. Clarence S.: Already I'm seeing benefits in my own life. It opened up a whole avenue of opportunity that I can see into the future. Christian H.: I've gained in my understanding, in my knowledge of business. Khaila-Rose P.: It has helped me look at things from a different perspective. Christian H.: It's almost like you develop your own philosophy on life from this course, so I approach things in a different way, and I think that's what I've changed, whereas probably before I'd work for the manager for a long time, thought I probably knew it all. Khaila-Rose P.: I've done about 1,001 presentations since I first started this course, so that has been a huge advantage for me. Clarence S.: What appealed to me most was the block study. Work full time, study full time, and knock it over in three years as opposed to a six year part-time course. I won't lie to you, it's a heavy course load, and it's a very big juggling act. Kaitlan Cuell: Creating a balance with uni and work and social life has been difficult, especially in the beginning, just such a massive change. Khaila-Rose P.: But I know that I only have three years to complete it, and so it motivated me to keep going. It's been very intense, I'm a single mum. Christian H.: Sometimes I'm not even quite sure, you get to the end of a semester and you think, ""How did I actually get there?"" Probably something I've also learned is how to manage my time a bit better. Clarence S.: This course allows you to think differently, and allows you to bring new ideas to wherever it is that you work, so employers will see benefits from the knowledge and skills that students pick up throughout this course. Khaila-Rose P.: It's not like you do this course, and then you go away and start a job. You're doing the course at the same time you're working, so you have a really good way to apply those skills at the same time. Clarence S.: It sets a really solid platform to be able to move up into a particular area within an organisation, within a government department, or to kick off your own business, which for aboriginal people, hopefully we can certainly get people moving in that direction and we can change the status quo and the socioeconomics for a lot of communities. Advice for prospective students would be just get into it. The knowledge that you can pick up through the BBA will only serve to better where you are now, or where you want to be in the future. I can't speak highly enough of it. Kaitlan Cuell: Be prepared, and go in knowing that it's going to be a hard couple of years, but at the end of it, it's going to be completely worthwhile and change your life.

Shirlena Gallagher Hi everyone, my name is Shirlena Gallagher. I'm a proud Wadi Wadi woman living on the beautiful Yuin country of the South Coast in New South Wales. I took the journey of the Bachelor of Business Administration, at the University of Technology, Sydney. Never had the courage to do it. I had some really strong, powerful indigenous elders that guided me. I took that step. I've now completed a three year full time study load, and I successfully done it with distinction. If I can do it, so can you. Darren Hammond Yaama My name is Darren Hammond, I'm a Gomeroi man from Moree. Recently just graduated, the Bachelor of Business Administration from UTS. Benefits for myself studying this degree has been that I was able to take the learnings and take it back and practically implement them into my organizations and my career. Success for me has been that I've worked my way up through community organizations to currently being a C in a CEO role. Liana Hello, my name is Liana. I'm a Gamilaraay woman. We're here in Gadigal country in Sydney. I'm a UTS Business Administration student. I enrolled in this degree because I want to develop my business skills, my practical skills, because I have a lot of creative ideas and I want to take that home to community and help Mob. Kerry Hi, I'm Kerry, I've just completed a Bachelor of Business Administration at UTS. 2020 was my last class but we had a couple of years off due to COVID. Very proud, very great course I, I excelled. I achieved Dean's Merit List awards in all three years. So you can do that too. Everyone here is fantastic and everyone is so helpful. If you need help. If you need a tutor, if you need any assistance whatsoever, it is here for you. I could not recommend this course more highly. Jo Hi, I'm Jo, I'm from Darwin. And at the moment I'm on at the UTS Uni Building on Gadigal Land. I wanted to do this course because you know, I've always wanted to start my own business. And I think it's a great opportunity because I get to learn a lot of components in the business industry. And but my biggest passion in doing this is to actually go back to my hometown in Darwin. And because I work with Department of Health, I go out to remote communities to do health activities with them. And with being on those communities. I actually, you know, see potential in community people, developing small businesses for themselves. So I guess in that sense, I'm really privileged to be going out to those communities, and taking back what I've learned here and putting it into those communities. So, you know, they have some sense and some opportunity to you know, think about developing and creating their own business in that sense. 23564 Business BBA Brochures - updates_FA2.pdfPDF, 2.76 MB 23525 Business BBA Student Handbook_FA2.pdfPDF, 1.91 MB UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands.

https://www.uts.edu.au/industry/corporate-training/courses/uts-and-microsoft-collaborate-solve-skills-shortages,"New online Graduate Certificate in Business Consulting and Technology Implementation available to learners globally. Learn more The UTS Graduate Certificate in Business Consulting and Technology Implementation has been co-designed with Microsoft and leading services firms Avanade, Capgemini and EY. It has been created to provide students from a wide range of backgrounds with the skills and knowledge to work in the professional field of functional consulting using Microsoft Dynamics. Liz Blatchford 0:07 So this is a world first, this incredible collaboration with UTS, and Microsoft to build an accelerated program to bring more functional consultants into the market to meet the demand that we're seeing now. And in the future. Mai Hansford 0:22 It's a burgeoning industry, digital transformation is what a lot of businesses are about. So their business consultants are scarce on the ground. And these business consultants help businesses to move into this new space using their systems in ways that are going to benefit business. Natalia Nikolova 0:43 So this Graduate Certificate will provide pathways for you to work in some of the biggest consulting and advisory companies in the world. So students will be presented with a real client project, a similar one that they will be facing when they actually start the career as a Dynamics consultant. Tharlon Khinzaw 1:00 So Dynamics 365 is a CRM that has also additional features, such as allowing customer service interactions, and ability to solve customer issues. Kurt Solarte 1:11 Dynamics and Power platform are a great kind of set of platforms allow us to do all sorts of things from CRM, through to things like automation and logic app, it's a really, it's a whole platform that lets our functional consultants decide which of the multiple pieces of the platform should be hooked together to solve our clients business problems. Ben Davis 1:33 We've seen our partners like KPMG, EY, Avanade, Capgemini really driving digital transformation with our customers seeking an edge seeking a competitive advantage, optimizing their businesses, of course, with all of that growth in the customer space, our partners are seeking more and more people to come into their businesses to enable that and help their customers. Josephine Porrier 1:53 So functional consultants come from wide and varied backgrounds, you know, you can imagine a finance consultant might come from finance background, but they don't necessarily have to, they could come from a commerce or business type background. They don't need to come from computer science. Lucia Gamarra 2:07 We have hired teachers, we've hired accountants, we have hired Field Sales officers, we've hired a range of people, this is a great career, because there's never a dull moment, every project is very, very different. John Zampa-Howe 2:24 I'm in my 50s now and I've had a significant career in the military. And I thought that was all I was going to do. I spent many roles in army over 25 years, none of them it related. Prajwal Bhetwal 2:35 As a consultant, you're doing multiple things in multiple projects. Sometimes you have to wear a hat of a planner, sometimes you have to wear hat or be designers. Sometimes you have to wear a hat of a tester. Cathy Xu 2:44 Other skills include communication skills, you're talking to a wide range of stakeholders. So it's important you know how to communicate and get your point across creative thinking skills and problem solving skills are super important. Also facilitation skills, you'll be helping facilitate workshops and meetings a lot more. So there are plenty of opportunities. Kurt Solarte 3:04 I think certifications are really important that Microsoft has looked into you and certified your knowledge on the platform is really important to a lot of clients who are in the market right now looking to acquire expertise and really get help. Natalia Nikolova 3:16 It is very experiential is very realistic students who work in teams, there'll be facing a realistic scenario. And they'll have to go through the process of how do you actually solve a current problem and implement a solution. It's challenging, it's not easy, but it also brings in a lot of learning opportunities, and really prepare students for the next step, which is to go out and work with real clients. Josephine Porrier 3:40 There is a huge demand for functional consultants. Every single day, a new deal comes across my desk and this doesn't seem like it's slowing down anytime soon. It's just only going to get greater demand from here. The Graduate Certificate comprises six subjects and aims to equip participants with the business, human-centric and technical skills needed to work as functional consultants, either in Microsoft's partner ecosystem or its client base. This course combines UTS research and academic rigour from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and UTS Business School with the technology and industry expertise of Microsoft and leading service firms Content focuses on real-world case studies and implementation practice via organisations such as Avanade, Capgemini and EY. Students build foundational knowledge of the features and capabilities of Microsoft Dynamics 365 & Power Platform. Graduates enter the workforce with a unique skill-set to set them apart in an in-demand field. Learn more about the course and the future of technology consulting from industry leaders and UTS experts. Mai Hansford 0:05 The Graduate Certificate in Business Consulting and Technology Implementation has been co-creation with Microsoft and industry partners to fill a gap in their employment needs. So their business consultants are scarce on the ground. There, it's a burgeoning industry, digital transformation is what a lot of businesses are about. And these business consultants help businesses to move into this new space, make sure that they're efficient. And using their systems in ways that are going to benefit their business. The core subjects in the Graduate Certificate, it's stakeholder engagement, one on Dynamics 365, and the technical skills that you need to be a business consultant. Alongside that you do a subject on business processes, which helps you understand the context for the application. And there is a final subject or Studio Capstone where you pull together all of the skills and knowledge that you've gleaned from the other subjects and use them in client scenario. The Graduate Certificate is offered fully online - the material. But we also have live online sessions with tutors. So in each subject, there'll be three or four sessions where you get to speak to a tutor, speak to fellow students, and you can ask questions, you can clarify your understanding of concepts. So you're not alone. You have all of the information that you can go back and reread, use the interactive material that's there that helps submit the concepts are because they are in practice, you know, what UTS is well known for its theory to practice, we've got that marriage a down pat. I think in this course, the consulting firms that are part of the Microsoft Dynamics ecosystem. They have been very involved in this course, this involvement has meant that we have real world case studies, we've got their advice, their information, scenarios that they know that you will face when you become a business consultant. And so there's that real sense of preparing yourself for the workforce. These consulting firms are committed to this course and committed to welcoming the graduates into their firms. So they're very enthusiastic about this course, they're very involved with it. And the job opportunities are there for you when you graduate. Francesco Bailo 2:44 This subject will run in parallel with the business processes where students will learn about the business, business issues and business problems that they will need to be able to apply in a software context in the in the implementations subject. So students will also learn ethical principles to deal with these new kinds of challenges. Alan Davidson 3:06 The Microsoft collaboration with UTS is really demonstrating our university such as UTS can be agile and responsive to industry needs. And through a co-design process and being responsive within months, not years in building up workforce profile and understanding the nature of the workforce needs. John Zampa-Howe 0:05 Within my role as a functional consultant at Avanade, I configure Microsoft Power Platform to meet the needs of the business that I am working with. Prajwal Bhetwal 0:14 Technology in the 21st century is moving in such a fast pace, that you know, more and more industries are now adapting to no code, low code platform. That means, with simple drag and drop and little very less complexity, you can actually build apps and software for different companies. And that is where, you know, Microsoft is heading right. And Microsoft Power Platform itself. Lucia Gamarra 0:36 Functional consultants, they design the system for a client, to give them the output that they need to automate their business. Tharlon Khinzaw 0:46 The functional consultant at Capgemini, works with clients to solve their issues, and uses the available infrastructure and IT to solve these issues. Francesco Bailo 0:57 It's really again about targeting consultants that want to bring innovation into into companies through the use innovative use of this of the software applications. Kurt Solarte 1:10 Functional consultant at EY is a bit of a glue in a project. So we've got, you know, developers and engineers that are working through a platform and we have some of the business analysts that are working through the business problems. And what the functional consultant does is tie those two things together, make sure we understand how we can meet the business requirements. With the chosen set of technology stack that we have. Dynamics and Power Platform are a great kind of set of platforms allow us to do all sorts of things from your traditional CRM through to things like automation and logic apps. And so really, it's a whole platform that lets our functional consultants and our architects decide which of the multiple pieces of the platform should be turned on and hooked together to solve our client's business problems. John Zampa-Howe: The great thing about the subject specifically is that students don't require any programming or coding experience or skills. The software actually implement low code, no code principles, allowing everyone with, again, no coding experience to take full advantage of the different opportunities offered by the software. I'm in my 50s now and I've had a significant career in the military and I thought that was all I was going to do. So for me, this is really good. Where Avanade has looked at my soft skills that I have from previous experience, they've seen my potential and they've given me the opportunity to embark in a new career that I never thought I'd ever be in. No, I've never had any experience other than turning a printer on in the office. So this is a great opportunity really for me to learn new skills and utilize those into the future. I spent many roles in army over 25 years, none of them IT related. So this is really good for me. This is a great learning experience. Prajwal Bhetwal: Dynamics 365 is basically a Microsoft prebuilt platform which different company uses to build business solutions for them. When I joined Avanade, I thought like, we all the people come from different technical backgrounds only. When I joined Avanade, I saw a guy from Defence, I saw someone from student academy background, I saw a salesperson being consultant, I saw data analyst being consultants. So it's a combination of a lot of different occupations. It doesn't have to be technical background that you have to belong to. However, it would be great because everyone has their own strengths, right? Someone has great soft skills, some have got great technical skills, and it doesn't have to be one or the other, right? If you have that willingness to become a consultant, then you can definitely go out and learn. And technical skills can always be learned, so that's not a problem. Lucia Gamarra: Functional consultants don't necessarily have to come from IT backgrounds. We quite often hire people that come from very, very, very different industries. We have hired teachers, we've hired accountants, we have hired field sales officers, we've hired a range of people. We hire many non-IT professionals. We look for people who have work experience, who can basically apply their industry knowledge into designing solutions for customers. Tharlon Khinzaw: At UTS, I studied business and IT, so I majored in marketing and business information systems management. As I mentioned before, the business aspect allows me to have a different insight from a lot of my other peers who are more technical. So I'm able to see in a more selling and financial aspect that how an idea or can help a client become profitable or just kind of be able to think something that's more marketable. Josephine Porrier: So functional consultants come from wide and varied backgrounds. You can imagine a finance consultant might come from a finance background, but they don't necessarily have to. They could come from a commerce or a business type background. They don't need to come from computer science. I think everyone in the old days used to think that was a given that you had to come from computer science. We also have people coming from industry. So they'll come from industry and they've worked in a certain place for a while, then they'll transfer across and learn the application. And when they learn the application, they can often be some of our best functional consultants. We also have people who are coming from other they've been out of the industry for a while, out of all industries, I should say. They've been out of work and so being on maternity leave or they've been in the military. Then they come back and, you know, they can be functional consultants, but it's really it's all about attitude. It's not so much about what you've done in the past, it's about what you want to do in the future. Kurt Solarte: I don't really think you have to have any particular background to come from. I think that's the beauty of working on a platform like this and on going into consulting. I think if you're open minded, I think if you are a good learner and you spend the time and effort to understand the platform when you get on site to understand the client's business and their problem need, that's what's needed. It's really about diving deep, getting experience and understanding what people need and pulling that together and then executing. I think not having a technical background can actually often be quite an advantage for a functional consultant. So someone that can understand a business problem really well and then has spent the time to really learn about the platform, become certified and understand the value of the platform will really be good at stitching together how that platform can solve those business problems. John Zampa-Howe: So one of the other things that I wanted to do was really future proof a career for me. I wanted to get into an industry that was going to give me, you know, longevity, probably 1020 years of meaningful work and also learning experience that happens on a daily basis. And the learning aspect is something that keeps me motivated to do well here at Avanade. Prajwal Bhetwal: I think this is a good long term choice because in 21st century IT industry is moving in such a fast pace that more and more industries now want no code, low code platform that can build complex business solutions, complex applications and softwares with just quick drag and drop, drag and drop and less code is required. So that is where Microsoft is heading. And if you look at the market today, there's a little bit of a skill shortage in terms of Power Platform as well. So even to fill that gap and progress on that career pathway, I think this is a great career for the next 10-20 years. Lucia Gamarra: Technology is such a big part of our lives right now that it is really future proofing in your career. Kurt Solarte: Right now this career is massively in demand. There's all sorts of corporations and government entities that have made massive investments in Microsoft Platforms and they have a huge need for people to come in who are knowledgeable in the platform, who've been certified by Microsoft and who understand what it's going to take to move them from where they are to where they want to be. You could see functional consultants move into big program management or project management. You could see them climb up into more deep business analysis or data analysis. You could see functional consultants go heavily technical. They could fall in love with the platform and become a developer worker or configurer on the platform. So I think really, when you start your career at functional consultant, you're kind of right in the middle and can start to figure out where you want it to take you. Tharlon Khinzaw: Honestly, I think long term I want to be able to create or help create something that will positively impact the world and that my contribution can be seen that can really make an impact and I don't know, just put a smile on people's faces. Josephine Porrier: As a functional consultant, it's really the basis, the foundation for a number of different roles. You can go into a people leadership role, you can go into a deep solution architect role, you can stay being a functional consultant, particularly in that area. But for me, one of the most fantastic things is being able to transfer those skills to another country, so the UK, the US or Europe, just to be able to do the same thing because you're a functional consultant. There is a huge demand for functional consultants. We are literally down I can't tell you how many people with current projects today for the lack of functional consultants in the industry today. It's been a problem for a while and we've tried to develop people from outside the industry and brought them into being functional consultants, but the demand keeps growing. The demand that I'm seeing every single day, a new deal comes across my desk. And this doesn't seem like it's slowing down any time soon. So it's just only going to get greater demand from here. John Zampa-Howe: Dynamics 365 is a suite of intelligent business applications that connects customers, operations, people and products. Power Platform analyzes data, builds solutions, automates processes and creates virtual agents in order to resolve business problems. Prajwal Bhetwal: Dynamics 365 is basically a Microsoft prebuilt platform which different companies use to build business solutions for them. PowerApps basically is a combination of four different suite of tools which helps functional consultants or technical consultants to build different software solutions using those tools. So it could be canvas app or model driven app or Power Automate that is used to design an app for different purposes. Tharlon Khinzaw: So Dynamics 365 is a CRM that has also additional features such as allowing customer service interactions and ability to solve customer issues. So the Power platform consists of Power Apps, which allows businesses to build low code apps as well as Power BI, which allows businesses to visualize data and make insights with that data and Power Automate, which allows businesses to automate a task that can usually be very autism or cumbersome. It allows organizations to improve their business operations. Kurt Solarte: Well, the Dynamics and Power platform are a great kind of set of platforms that allow us to do all sorts of things from your traditional CRM through to things like automation and logic apps. So really it's a whole platform that lets our functional consultants and our architects decide which of the multiple pieces of the platform should be turned on and hooked together to solve our clients, business problems. John Zampa-Howe: Avanade is a great place to work at, firstly for the culture. I was impressed with the culture right from the start of the interview process, going through the academy as a student and then graduating as a CRM consultant. The leadership and mentoring that we have is outstanding and that certainly holds us in good stead. And I also really like the feel that we're in a huge family. It's a great thing to be part of the team here at Avande. Lucia Gamarra: Why Avanade? Avanade delivers on its promise to provide an inclusive, supportive environment that will help consultants grow and develop in their career. Avanade is very conscious of people's health and wellbeing. We provide health and wellbeing allowance. We provide My days, which are additional annual leave days. We also provide flexible working arrangements and we also provide our staff with gadget allowances so that they keep current. Tharlon Khinzaw: Yeah. So as an Associate consultant at Capgemini, I currently am learning everything Microsoft and Dynamics and Power platform. This includes learning and obtaining certifications as well as shadowing senior managers on projects and just I'm actually currently also a part of coordinating a big response. Josephine Porrier: The beauty of being with Capgemini is we have so much industry depth that even if someone doesn't come from that background, we can really upskill them very quickly. So someone like a graduate can get to know so much about the industry very, very rapidly instead of having to spend a good decade in that industry. Kurt Solarte: So EY are currently looking for functional consultants right across the spectrum in Microsoft, that's everything from the cloud platform Azure straight through to Dynamics and the Power Platform. We need them for our clients who need them to finish their projects, even to kind of do the solution and plan out where they're going to be in the next year, two years, five years, as they move whole swaths of their business onto the Microsoft platform. Yeah EY is a great place to work for a single of reason that we focus solely on people. All we do is offer our services and our people. We don't have any other products or anything we sell. And so the whole focus of the firm is on people, around further education, around giving them the opportunities they need, around mentoring them, around making sure their whole career experience is what they want it to be, and making sure that translates into outcomes for our clients. This initiative is focused on solving existing skill shortages and helping to fill some of the estimated 286,000* additional skilled technology workers needed over the next four years (*Tech Council of Australia).

https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-arts-and-social-sciences/international-studies-education/undergraduate/courses/bachelor-arts-international-studies/employability-and-skills,"Students who complete the Bachelor of Arts in International Studies graduate with a double degree (BAIS & degree from other Major). Find here examples of former students from different disciplines and explore how they communicate what they have learned through BAIS, particularly during their year abroad to future employers. William Du, ICS China: If there is one thing, I have taken away from my ICS year, it is that I am highly passionate about international engagement. My year abroad surrounded me with people from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds – living in dorm buildings alongside people from every continent gave me opportunities to learn something new about the world every day that I would never have even considered in Australia. This also allowed me to develop a strong and fluent set of intercultural communication skills. I am now more confident in my abilities to connect with and find common ground with different people. By engaging with locals and expats alike in everyday chat and through my ICS empirical research project, I was able to relate to people anywhere from Nigeria to North Korea. This has also helped me greatly in my employability. As diversity initiatives are becoming increasingly common focuses for international employers, I am able to collaborate more effectively and build rapport with team members. Furthermore, I am able to bring an expansive international network and bilingualism to the job, underpinned by my cultural expertise from my international connections and empirical research project. Adam Brieger, ICS Latino USA: After my ICS year at the University of Texas, Austin, I remained in the United States to work as a legislative intern at a non-profit research organisation on campus for six months. I worked in a team to research and summarise political and legal developments in different States, with the mission of enhancing transparency in government. This allowed me to engage with my host country’s political environment and learn about the diverse cultures and perspectives that constitute it. Evans Li, ICS Japan: Through my ICS program, I found a way to grow my personality, and self-confidence by getting familiar with opening myself up to meet people from all walks of life. Of course, a majority were the Japanese roommates whom I stayed with and who broadened my understanding of their values and worldviews (for example, their attitudes towards growing up, their education system, gender roles, household values, cultural identity and much more). I gradually learnt to share my own interests in food as a cultural bridge with other international students, through my thesis and ultimately got my Japanese friends and roommates involved in the research gathering process like attending interviews and looking into resources and concepts I personally wouldn't have found on my own. Evans Li, ICS Japan: Becoming acquainted with the nuances and phrases in casual, everyday Japanese language as well as having the fundamental knowledge of formal and business Japanese has opened a world of opportunities for my career. It has enabled me to apply a deeper understanding towards the Japanese consumer market including marketing to their preferences for mobile devices, popular demographics and much more. Jack Berkefeld, ICS Argentina: My 2017 ICS trip to Argentina shaped me into the journalist I am today. There are many subtle 'soft skills' a journalism student must develop before they are to be released in the world and an experience as life changing as a year's study abroad is a unique opportunity to develop these skills. One of these skills I developed was independence. Prior to my time in Argentina I was a very anxious and shy young lad. I was in many ways dependent on the good will of others in my journalism as I was too anxious to assert myself. My time in Argentina changed all that: immersing oneself in a (by Australian standards) gruff and insular culture where English isn't spoken requires one to come to terms with their social anxieties and to push past them. This reckoning compelled me to develop my own self-confidence in the face of adversity and I haven't looked back since. Evans Li, ICS Japan: One of the biggest hurdles and milestones of ICS for many is moving away from home for a year. For the most part, being away from supervision, parental support enabled me to become more self-sufficient and conscious of my own decisions in life in setting up things like insurance, ensuring deadlines were met on top of balancing other daily tasks. Being in charge of my life led me to becoming more organised and understanding of my performance. Rather than being told how to do something and who to compare against, I developed confidence in knowing what I needed to do and what skills I needed to achieve it which has been invaluable in adapting to a constantly changing work environment. Dexter Cave, ICS Germany: I used to think I had it all sorted out, that I understood not only myself but other people. I had a preconceived idea of what Germany, Germans, and Berlin would be like. But after a year in Berlin I think what I really learnt was to question myself, question my predispositions, and my assumptions. I became super aware of my Australian-ness, and I began to question how I behaved in public, how I felt about the world, and ask why I felt those things, or why I behaved that way. I think that observing people in a different cultural setting brought about a self-awareness that I didn’t have before. Jack Berkefeld, ICS Argentina: As a journalist, I think it's essential to be able to empathise with your subject matter - especially the marginalised - as it is their stories that are most likely to be misrepresented. A very jarring yet necessary method of getting a sense of the struggles of those around you is to spend time in a city like Buenos Aires where inequality is apparent as soon as you step out your front door. I would say that I developed on a moral level through my time in Argentina, especially when I went travelling and was able to make friends with people from all walks of life. Those relationships have helped me develop a 'fuller' picture of the world around me and have made me better appreciate the privileges I am blessed with. Ninah Kobel, ICS Argentina: During my exchange in Buenos Aires, I took a class where the professor asked for a “female” student to be his assistant for the semester. He said he would need help to distribute reading material and correspond with the class and felt “women are just better suited to those sorts of tasks”. The feminist in me was horrified, but I didn’t know what to do. I realised I was a foreigner in a different culture and wanted to be respectful of that. But after weeks watching his assistant do his menial chores, I felt I had to say something. I decided to write him an email, but what started as a few lines, quickly turned into an essay. What I learnt from this is that resilience isn’t about accepting things the way they are. It’s about approaching them discerningly; thinking critically and creatively to find constructive ways of managing difficult situations. The professor responded to my multi-page essay with a few half-hearted lines, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he still asks for a female assistant every semester. But I feel more positive about my exchange experience knowing I held true to my values, even while immersing myself in a new cultural environment. Sally Hunt, ICS Chile: My ICS experience in Chile exposed me to so many different and surprising cultural perspectives. For the first time in my life, I felt deeply and personally challenged by other people’s beliefs, particularly relating to Chilean history and politics. I came to realise the importance of actively listening and finding reason and having empathy for other people’s personal experiences and worldviews across the political spectrum, even when they directly oppose my own. After I graduated from a Bachelor of Laws/Bachelor of Arts in International Studies, I went on to work as a native title lawyer. I was able to apply the intercultural reflection skills I learnt abroad back home. I used my skills to build trust, and to listen closely to my clients’ concerns and wishes to solidify their unique personal histories as evidence in their native title claims. Native title can be a very delicate process, as the various stakeholders in native title proceedings often have deeply opposing historical, cultural and spiritual experiences and perspectives. I was able to listen and empathise with all interested parties, and then effectively explain the operation of the native title system to mitigate their particular concerns. The skills I learned during my ICS year allowed me to work towards securing the best outcomes for my clients throughout the different stages of the native title process. Steph Newman, ICS Japan: When we think about international study, we’re quick to identify the new things that we can learn: a foreign language, a way of life in another place. But what we sometimes forget to consider is how spending time in a different place will help us learn more about ourselves, about our own culture and way of life. One of the most surprising things about spending any extended period overseas is how much we reflect on being the outsider, the foreigner. For students who have never experienced being part of a cultural minority, this can be quite a shock. For me, growing up white in Australia afforded me privilege and anonymity: nobody ever looked at this face in a crowd. It was only when I moved to rural Japan as part of In-Country Study that I learned what it was like to be identified instantly as a foreigner. I also learned how strange so many things about my own culture seem to other cultures. While we often go abroad and ask ourselves, “Why do they dress like that? Why do they eat this?”, travel also allows us to question our own countries. Why, for example, do Australians dress so casually to go to work, compared to the formal suit of the Japanese worker? How did we develop an appetite for Vegemite? Learning a foreign language, too, prompts reflection: why is English spelling so difficult? Where did we get these strange Australian slang terms from? Half an hour trying to teach my Japanese friends the difference between “avo” and “arvo” had me questioning the logic of Australian English. Returning to Australia, students will find themselves enriched by the ability to understand what it’s like to be culturally different, a highly valuable skill for moving into multicultural workplaces. Students will hopefully return home a little more reflective, a little more empathetic. Matthew Young, ICS Germany: As an aspiring filmmaker studying media and communications, I utilised my ICS research projects to more extensively practice and deepen my media analysis skills whilst specialising in the context of Germany and the German screen industry. For my first assessment task, I chose to conduct a discourse analysis on the hit German TV drama series “Weisensee” (on German Netflix). I looked at how commercial drama content producers in Germany today are treating certain German cultural identities (Eastern Germans v West Germans) and how that representation reflects imbalanced power relations. This led me to look into on-going debates and tensions popularly featured in the local print and online media in my ICS city (Potsdam), which made what I had encountered in my analysis not just something I had studied, but something very real and present in the former Eastern German community I was now immersed in! I then decided to make my major research assessment task an opportunity to delve and investigate this niche subject area further. This all resulted in me developing the ability to independently lead research projects, design and conduct interviews and surveys, as well as gave me a tonne of confidence through experience in communicating both professionally and personally with others (let alone in a foreign language!). Maria Gaudioso, ICS Italy: As part of my In-Country Research Project, I chose to examine and compare pedagogy – Whole Language Approach VS the Italian State School System. Whilst undertaking research, I completed observations in a variety of schools in Lecce. My observations were of English Language teachers in primary and middle school. This was by far the most beneficial and enjoyable part of my time in Lecce. This experience in Italy has proven to be beneficial in my professional development as a foreign language teacher but has also given me the opportunity to gain firsthand knowledge about how teaching practices can differ within different cultures and societies. This project has demonstrated to me the importance of creating contacts with teachers in other countries and working in different intellectual traditions to learn and develop teaching methodologies. As a result of this program, I maintained contact with one school in particular “Scipione Ammirato Scuola Media Lecce” and several of their English teachers. When visiting Lecce on holidays, I always included a visit to the school to work with the students on their English Language skills and to share with them the Australian culture. Ninah Kobel, ICS Argentina: During my time in Argentina I found myself living in a large share-house with 7 housemates and an adopted street cat called Cuña. When Cuña’s owner went overseas, I volunteered to look after her in his absence. But pretty soon after he left Cuña started to get really sick. I rallied the housemates and a few of us decided to take her to the vet. To our horror, the vet told us that not only did she have a life threatening (but curable) condition, but that Cuña’s owner already knew about it. He had come in with her already but ignored the vet’s advice on treatment. After a housemate meeting, we decided to do our best to save her; taking turns bringing her to appointments and surgery and agreeing to split the costs if her owner refused to pay. During project 'rescue Cuña’, I was covered in cat diarrhoea, scratched, bitten and travelled across Buenos Aires on the subway to collect a bag of rare cat blood. But I always had a housemate by my side. And nothing says team effort like working together to save a life. Ankita Saha, ICS France: During my ICS year I observed the diversity of France and became eager to produce a research project that could investigate how different aspects of a society can overlap. My area of interest was activism and how it can be motivated by race, a contentious topic in France. I found numerous organisations in Marseille that were at the forefront of anti-racism movements and became eager to gather primary data such as interviews and observations. However, while I had an ideal plan in my head this was not as easily achieved when put into motion. I faced a plethora of challenges from non-responsive organisations to cancelled rallies and protests. Despite all of this, I remained resilient and my commitment to my research topic was kept on track by monitoring the news and my surroundings for examples of activism commenting on or against racism. This allowed me to change my approach and reach out to individuals on a more personal level and gather interviews both in person and online, which reflected the views and opinions of a diverse make up of France’s society. With every challenge I overcome, I was able to redirect the path of my project and learn the value of preserving to reach a goal. Evans Li, ICS Japan: The other side of being away from home and support is that there isn’t any safety net to help you when things don’t go your way. While preparation did help with ICS, not everything always went according to plan, whether a laptop stopped working or there was a missed flight, being responsible in the deep end ultimately taught me not only the skill of thinking on your feet but also being prepared to learn from the process of overcoming the situation. India Bennett, ICS France: The research methodologies I chose for my ICS project were surveys and interviews. To ensure the feasibility and success of both necessitated much planning, initiative and engagement with the local community. Coordinating the interviews in particular was challenging as it required me to make, sustain and utilise connections with Caennais people. I was able to meet interviewees through the university’s host family scheme and my relationship with professors. Similarly, I was able to conduct surveys of my local classmates with the help of professors who were interested in my topic. Undertaking the research required planning of how long data collection (interviewing, transcribing, distributing and collecting surveys), synthesis and analysis would take – as well as accounting for a wide margin of potential non-responses for the surveys – so I made sure that I had completed both the interviews and surveys over a month before the project due date. Keeping to a strict timeline and setting and achieving goals allowed me to stay on task and ensured that I completed the project to a high standard. Through the process of completing my project I learnt the importance of self- and project management and, especially in light of my difficulties with project management in earlier stages of the project, credit the quality of my research and work to my development of these skills. Dexter Cave, ICS Germany: My ICS project about Tempelhofer Feld used a VLT (virtual landscape tour) as a vessel to communicate an ethnographic, as well as, historical understanding of the space. The idea came about from all the time I spent personally exploring the space over the year. I rode my bike around the giant park at least four times a week. And through doing this repetitive action and seeing how the park changed on a micro-scale, as well as progressively learning more about the park’s history through my own research, I developed the idea for my VLT. I wanted to take my viewer on an average late-autumn bike ride but also point out the nuance, complexity, and depth of meaning present in this space. To reveal things that are not necessarily obvious, things hidden on purpose, and understand how communities continue to occupy and structure space. Sally Hunt, ICS Chile: During my ICS year in Chile, I was challenged with many situations in which my personal ethics were confronted in the face of new social, legal, environmental and cultural contexts. Every responsible traveller tries not to offend the local culture wherever they go, whether that be following local laws, dressing and behaving appropriately, abiding by local traditions and norms, and generally trying to fit in. However, really becoming part of a culture challenges your ethics in all new ways, as you are not just passing through, but living within its boundaries and constructs. Do I politely let something pass without comment because it is simply ‘how it is done’ here, even if I feel it is morally incorrect and unjustified? This was a question I asked myself daily during my year abroad. Negotiating my way through these daily ethical challenges really developed my diplomacy skills: it opened my mind to new perspectives and taught me to stand up for myself and others when I felt it was required, to lead by example, and to communicate effectively, despite a strong difference of opinion. This skill has been an important asset in my professional life. As a non-Indigenous native title lawyer, I really enjoyed learning from the many different cultural dynamics I was exposed to, and as the International Teams Coordinator for an international solar car race, I was able to manage many different cultural expectations and behaviours in a predominantly male, tech-based field. Wendy Min, ICS France: Total immersion and engagement with France during the In-Country Studies (ICS) year eleven years ago allowed me to examine the depth and complexity of ethics. I developed this understanding through a range of areas such as debates sparked by social contemporary issues faced by the French and in which I participated as well as various dilemmas and questions that I explored during my studies, research and overall observation of French society. What is more delightful is how my ICS mindset and skills learnt from ICS stayed with me after all these years and how applicable it is regardless of which industry, which country/destination I’m in and which international activities I am busy with. I was faced with ethical questions during my year abroad through something as small as tasting foie gras to larger issues through a teaching opportunity I had in a French school where we debated concepts such as secularism, the freedom to wear a hijab versus French Republican values as well as discussions on the reintroduction in French schools of courses civics and morality. Further discussions during my year abroad included topics such as France’s relationship with African countries to rising cases of police brutality against protesters during demonstrations. Such debates have all made me rethink ""Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité. Since the ICS year, the skills gained in the area of ethics has surfaced countless times in my various roles whether at the frontline reporting for a major Western media in Beijing or dealing with Apple and Microsoft supply chains in Greater China Region or encountering contemporary debates during my own travels in various destinations, predominantly sanctioned and controversial countries and certainly throughout the process of running my own small-scale and internationally oriented charity. The ICS experience continues. The difference is that my ethical considerations are not limited to just France or Francophone countries but the whole world.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/business-courses/postgraduate-business-options/your-postgraduate-questions-answered,"At UTS Business School, we’ve discovered that many people are uncertain about different aspects of postgraduate study, so we’ve put together this list of tips to help. The exact amount of tuition fees that you will pay depends on the subjects you enrol in and the particular course you’re studying. For each teaching period, your enrolment is finalised on the census date and you become financially liable for the tuition fees for those subjects in which you are enrolled. You can work out the tuition fees of your course using the online fee calculator (details below). You can work out the tuition fees of your course using the online fee calculator. Fill out the fields as follows: The results will then show you the cost per credit point, the total number of credit points in the course and an estimate of the cost per session if studying 24 credit points. If you are an Australian citizen, you may be eligible for the FEE-HELP loan scheme. If eligible, FEE-HELP can cover all or part of your tuition fees to a maximum amount - the FEE-HELP loan limit, over your lifetime. The amount you repay each year is a percentage of your income. The percentage increases as your income increases, so the more you earn, the higher your repayment will be. The ATO will calculate your compulsory repayment for the year and include it on your income tax notice of assessment. Alternatively, if what you are studying is directly related to your current job and you pay your fees upfront, you may also be able to claim your fees and other study-related expenses as a tax deduction. See the ATO website for more details. While you may have heard the phrase Commonwealth Supported Place, this generally refers to spaces in undergraduate courses where local students’ fees are subsidised as part of the Higher Education Commonwealth Support (HECS) scheme. While UTS Business School does not offer Commonwealth Support Places to students in our postgraduate programs, you may be able to defer your fees under the Australian Government’s Higher Education Loan Program (FEE-HELP). While you can defer fees under the program, you will pay back the entire amount instead of just a student contribution. We offer a range of scholarships for both commencing and continuing students. Many of our scholarships and prizes awarded to high-achievers are funded by our Industry Partners. To explore the UTS scholarships that may be relevant for you, use the scholarships search tool. If you have already completed a degree at UTS, you may be eligible for our Alumni Advantage program. Eligible alumni will receive a 10% saving on tuition fees for full fee-paying courses (this includes students accessing FEE HELP) when enrolling for award programs commencing after 1 January 2017. The saving will apply automatically to graduates upon successful enrolment. To find out more and check whether the discount is offered for your course, visit Alumni Advantage. All programs at UTS Business School involve some on-campus teaching. While the exact timetable for classes will differ depending on which course you are enrolled in, all of our postgraduate degrees offer a timetable that is designed to suit busy professionals. You can find the teaching dates for 2023 and 2024 here. Keep in mind that the Business School subjects run on the Primary Teaching Sessions (Main Calendar). In most of our courses, domestic students can generally choose to vary your timetable between 1, 2, 3 or 4 subjects per session – so the duration of study will depend on how many subjects you enrol in each session. You can change the number of subjects you enrol from session to session, so your study plan can easily be changed with your circumstances. Most of our commencing postgraduate students will begin with one subject in their first session as they adjust to studying along full-time work. There are 2 main sessions per year (Autumn and Spring sessions), with most part-time students doing 2 subjects per session. Some students will take units over our Summer session to speed up their course completion or make use of time during an off-peak work period. Another way to reduce the number of subjects you will complete each session is if you receive recognition of prior learning. The flexibility of your study plan will depend on which course you are enrolled in. Some courses may offer block mode subjects or some blended teaching. You may also be able to study fewer subjects in some sessions, take Leave of Absence from your study, or consult with your subject co-ordinator about minor alterations to your subject schedule. If you are a prospective student with specific questions about timetabling flexibility, submit an enquiry with UTS Business School and we’ll be in touch to discuss your circumstances. If you are an International Student, you may not be eligible to enrol part-time under your visa requirements. Contact the International Office for more advice. We believe that when you study you should learn something new and we recognise the value of your prior learning. At UTS Business School, Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is are granted where your previous study is deemed equivalent to UTS subjects and was not undertaken more than 10 years ago. Find more information on the Business School’s guidelines for RPL. In a postgraduate degree, RPL may be granted based on previously completed undergraduate qualifications, other postgraduate study (need not be a complete degree) or based on other recognised professional study, such as the CA and CPA programs. At the postgraduate level, exemptions are not granted for qualifications at a lower AQF level than an undergraduate degree. If you would like a rough guideline of what subjects you might be exempt from study, email copies of your transcripts to our advisors at business@uts.edu.au and we can provide you with a rough pre-assessment of the exemptions you may be eligible for. Most of our postgraduate business programs are delivered in a blended mode, meaning there are both on-campus and online components. Our part-time study modes offer a great degree of flexibility but do require regular (usually weekly) attendance on campus. Generally, material is provided online to assist in preparing for class (the slides for the lecture, pre-readings, practice examples, case studies etc.). While some classes may offer lecture recordings, these are intended for review purposes and are not intended as a substitute to attending classes. There are a selection of courses that are offered 100% online such as Business Analytics, Digital Marketing and an online MBA. You can see all available course options by visiting UTS Online. The amount of time you need to devote to study outside class hours is very subjective and will differ between students and subjects depending on how much you want to get out of it and your level of experience with a certain subject matter. As a general rule you might expect to undertake 2 hours of self-study for every hour of face-to-face teaching. This time might include reviewing class content, completing readings for upcoming classes, completing assessments or preparing for exams. Teaching content is usually provided online prior to each class to give you sufficient time to prepare for classes. Many of our buildings are open 24/7, with award-winning spaces that makes this much easier to manage. Many classes take place in the innovative Frank Gehry designed Dr Chau Chak Wing Building, just minutes from Central Station. UTS offers an optional Summer Session, running from late November to mid February. This is the same length as our main Autumn (March to June) and Spring (late July to early November) sessions. No classes run between Christmas and New Year. Note that only the Master of Marketing currently offers the option for students to commence the degree in Summer. Our programs are offered in a range of different formats that provide alternative entry paths and study durations. Generally, applicants to a masters degree study will have completed a bachelors degree and have 2+ years relevant work experience. If you do not meet the requirements to apply directly to the masters degree, you may be able to use the Graduate Diploma or Graduate Certificate as an entry pathway. Check the admission requirements and documentation that you’ll need for each course here. We have a range of postgraduate programs to choose from. Options include MBA programs suited to different experiences and aspirations and a range of specialised masters degrees as well as shorter graduate diplomas and certificates. You can read more about these options in our Postgraduate Course Guide. There are many different paths to gaining a postgraduate qualification from UTS Business School. Our programs are offered in a range of different formats that provide alternative entry paths and study durations, including graduate certificates, graduate diplomas, masters degrees and extended masters degrees. See our postgraduate business options and check out our postgraduate course guide for which course options are offered in each area of specialisation. The traditional path to postgraduate study is via a completed bachelors degree, but if you have professional experience (around 8 years) you may be eligible to enter a graduate certificate. The Graduate Certificate usually comprises of the first 4 subjects of the masters degree. It is designed for students with no undergraduate degree but extensive practical experience in the area of study. The course will provide you with the key building blocks before undertaking advanced level subjects in a graduate diploma or masters program. Upon successful completion of the Graduate Certificate, you can apply to go straight on to complete the diploma or masters degree. For example, if you have been working in marketing since high school and over the past 10 years have progressed to a marketing coordinator role, and want a formal qualification to cement your on-the-job learning and give you the confidence to go for managerial positions, you can commence a Graduate Certificate in Marketing. If you complete this with a credit average (65% or higher for your weighted average mark) you can articulate into the Master of Marketing. Similar arrangements exist for Accounting, Human Resources, Finance and a range of Management courses. If it's been a while since you last went to university (or school) and you haven’t done much mathematics, library searching or report writing since then, we have plenty of support options to bring you up to speed. Support comes from academic and support staff as well as your fellow students and includes free classes, workshops and online services all designed to help you survive your assignments. Applications for local students to commence coursework degrees in 2023 (in the Autumn and Spring Sessions) are now open. Postgraduate application covers more information about the documents required and to lodge your application. The process generally takes around 20 minutes to complete. Depending on the volume of applications we receive, you should be notified of the outcome within 3 weeks of submitting it as long as all required documentation has been included. Check the admission requirements and documentation that you’ll need for each course on applying to UTS. It is recommended that you have the following before submitting your application: The UTS enrolment guide (PDF) is a helpful guide about how to complete the enrolment process. The online enrolment process should walk you through accepting your offer, applying for FEE-HELP and creating a class timetable. We’ve summarised the steps below, should you be part-way through the process. If you encounter issues when enrolling, you will need to get in touch with the Student Centre. If you do not have full Australian Permanent Resident Status or Australian or New Zealand Citizenship, you will be classified as an international student. Being an international student in Australia covers everything you need to know about applying to UTS as an International Applicant. You can get in touch with the International Office if you have specific questions. If you’re considering applying to UTS Business School, be sure to confirm that the course you’re interested in is offered to international students. You can also check events in your country/region to find out when we are holding an information evening in your country/region — this page is updated regularly. You can apply to complete a PhD in one of the areas of specialisation. Before applying for a research degree with UTS Business School, you should submit an expression of interest to the UTS Business School Research Office. Expression of interest (PhD) covers the submission process and entry requirements. It is best to enquire well ahead (at least two months) before closing dates of formal applications. Refer to research degrees at UTS for these closing dates. Submitting an EOI before you formally apply to enrol for a PhD degree saves significant time for you and also speeds up the process of the formal application. The EOI process will take between three weeks to two months from the time we receive all the documents we request.If you have specific questions about research options at UTS, get in touch with the Business Research Office directly by email to BusinessHDR@uts.edu.au.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/science/science-courses/undergraduate-science-and-maths,"Stand at the cutting edge of scientific and mathematical discovery with an undergraduate degree from Australia’s number one young university. There are lots of science and maths degrees out there. Choose one that’s driving discovery. Willa Houston: [00:00:04] Welcome to the UTS Science and Mathematics introduction to the study opportunities here at UTS. My name's Associate Professor Willa Houston, and I'm the Associate Dean for Teaching and Learning for the faculty. So today we're going to give you an overview of the opportunities and experiences you would have as a student here at UTS Science. In this session, we're going to introduce you to what it is like to study here at UTS Science, particularly what our learning environments are like, some of the study areas and the career opportunities, and to share with you that you'll be studying at a world-leading university of technology. 100% of the research here at UTS has been rated by the Australian Government as at, or above world standard, especially in science. We're really known for our physical sciences, environmental sciences, chemistry and genetics, and this is the case in many other rankings as well. Just recently in the QS World University Rankings where we've been ranked the ninth leading university in Australia and in the Times Higher Education Impact Ranking, where we're second in all of Australia for our overall contributions to sustainable development. And we're the number one young university in Australia, according to the Times Higher Education. So you can see that you've got the opportunity to study at a really world-leading institution. Willa Houston: [00:01:21] In addition to those exciting world rankings, what we're really proud of at UTS science is our amazing staff and our amazing learning environments. We have over 4000 students studying right now at UTS Science, and our students rank their overall experience and their interactions with staff and students as above the national average compared to other science and mathematics faculties. The students also ranked the opportunity to develop their skills and our facilities and resources as above the national average for science and mathematics faculties around Australia. So that's just one way that you can see the exciting spaces, but let's take a deeper look now at what those spaces look like. Here's a quick snapshot of just some of the many exciting learning environments that you'll have the opportunity to study and learn in. And the reason why this is so important is UTS Science graduates are really well known for graduating with hands-on skills and all those professional attributes that make them ready to be employed in the workforce across their chosen disciplines. So now I'm going to hand over to my colleague, Associate Professor Cathy Gorrie is going to talk to you some more about some of the exciting, dynamic learning spaces. Cathy Gorrie: [00:02:29] You might find yourself in first year being taught in one of our super labs. These are large 250 seat labs where multiple classes are taught at the same time, so it's a vibrant and exciting learning environment. As you progress through your course, you might find yourself working in our other super lab, which is called the Hive. This is a PC2 lab, and in this environment you'll be doing more, you can immerse yourself in research-like activities, you'll be working in groups, and you'll have access to some of the most sophisticated instruments and audio-visual systems at UTS. So I'll hand over to Dr Scott Chadwick, who will tell you about some of the other spaces that we've got at UTS. Scott Chadwick: [00:03:20] Another really unique space that we have here at UTS is our Crime Scene Simulation suites. And in these suites, students have the opportunity to investigate crime scenes just like you would in the real world. So we have clandestine laboratories, ATMs, hit and runs, and more bedroom type crime scenes that you would experience as a forensic scientist in the real world. Another exciting set of spaces are for our chemistry and our physics students, where they will have access to some of the cutting-edge equipment that our researchers use day to day, and you'll have the opportunity to work on some of these exciting piece of kits, whether it's in the analytical chemistry laboratories, working on some scanning electron microscopy to see atoms and nanoparticles, or working in our optics laboratory where you get to play around with lasers and light. I'm going to pass over to my colleague, Dr Megan Murray, so she can speak to you about some of the other exciting things you can do at UTS. Megan Murray: [00:04:27] It's one thing to study beautiful photos of nature, but another thing to experience it and scientifically measure it. At UTS, we offer extensive field-based training opportunities in many subjects within our environment and marine science programs. This includes a week long training trip to our iconic Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, forest ecology inside Royal National Park, Biodiversity Surveys in World Heritage Blue Mountains area, and wildlife training with all kinds of native species, including possums and gliders in northern New South Wales. All of these images that you can see here are of, or from, our students completing their Bachelor's studies. Our students graduate from UTS, not just with knowledge, but real-world experience that is highly sought after by government and industry organisations. Willa Houston: [00:05:14] So now you've heard a lot about our spaces and the way that you learn here at UTS, it's time for you to learn a little bit about the kinds of areas that you can study in. At UTS, we have seven strengths areas where there's a range of opportunities in each of those areas for you to learn. We have medical science, forensic science, molecular biotechnology, chemistry, physics, environmental and marine sciences, and mathematical sciences; and so now we're going to talk a little bit more about what it's like to study and the types of courses we offer. Firstly, you'll notice that we have two options for how you might study across many of our areas. We have a number of what we call our name degrees, and we also have a large Bachelor of Science. In our name degrees, as you can see on the left of the slide, these degrees are focused on a particular area of science with a real strength focus on that course. So, for example, in each of these courses, there are majors to choose as well, but by choosing a course like this, you're kind of saying that you know what it is that you want, you want a clear profile in, say, medical science or forensic science or environmental biology, and these other names, of course, as you can see here. However, if you are thinking about more broad career opportunities or in fact, you're not quite certain yet which way your science is going to take you, and you perhaps want a little bit of flexibility or you actually know that you want to specialise in more than one area, then you should consider the Bachelor of Science. As you can see, the Bachelor of Science also has majors in each of our strength areas of the faculty, but within the Bachelor of Science, you also have the opportunity to customize your learning. In many of these areas, you can have a major, and you can also undertake a sub-major in another area. It's also easy to move between the majors within the Bachelor of Science. So really thinking about what it is that you want or if you're not sure what you want, might guide you in whether you're considering one of our name degrees or the Bachelor of Science. So now I'm going to hand over to my colleague again, Associate Professor Cathy Gorrie and she'll share with you the opportunities to learn in the area of medical science. Cathy Gorrie: [00:07:15] If you're interested in the human body, diseases of the human body and how to identify or treat them, then these are the types of courses that you might be most interested in. So there's a number of different ones and they have slightly different specialisations which are all outlined in the handbook. Or if you're interested in innovative solutions to environmental or medical issues, you might want to start a company to develop a research idea to address some of these issues, then you might be interested in molecular biotechnology. You can do this as the name degree, the Bachelor of Molecular Biotechnology, and major in either environmental or medical biotechnology, or a more flexible option in the Bachelor of Science, majoring in biotechnology. Megan Murray: [00:08:03] We have a suite of programs tailored for environmental science and marine biology, as you can see here. Our Environmental Biology Bachelor's degree focuses on a mix of terrestrial and freshwater ecology and biodiversity, with strong foundations in the essentials of environmental sustainability, conservation and protection. Our Marine Biology and Climate Change program is strongly themed around ocean processes and biodiversity, with good opportunities to enhance your experience on the impacts and mitigation strategies of climate change. We also have a flexible major within the Bachelor of Science where you can pick and mix and tailor your studies around the elements of environment and marine knowledge that you may wish to experience. Lots of different careers for different programs, as you can see here, and feel free to talk to your program directors for more information on this. Scott Chadwick: [00:08:52] The Bachelor of Forensic Science is actually the first forensic science course in Australia and that has made us a world leader in forensic science. And we also have the UTS Centre for Forensic Science, which makes studying here at UTS in Forensic Science an excellent opportunity for any student wishing to move into this particular field. The course that we have on offer does have options of four different majors in biology, chemistry, crime scene investigation and digital forensic science. So if you have an interest in forensics, you can also choose to specialise in one of the other majors that we have there. And there are a whole range of career opportunities for students in forensic science outside of the traditional policing programs. Mathematical sciences is another exciting course that we offer here, and as we move through our lives, a lot more of our lives are generating a lot of data, and we need people who understand and have the ability to interpret that data for meaningful information. So in the Bachelor of Mathematical Sciences, we have the pure and applied mathematics, but also the statistics and data science. So if people are really interested in a career in mathematics and the broad applications that that can have in a whole range of different fields, that's an excellent opportunity. Or if you want to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and have the opportunity to experience other fields of science, I'd recommend the Bachelor of Science majoring in Mathematics. Chemistry is another exciting major that we have in the Bachelor of Science here at UTS, and chemistry is all around us, and students who would take this course are the students that are interested in understanding more about the world around them. And you have the opportunity to make chemicals and test them and try to analyze what you've made in really hands-on, practice-oriented laboratories that we have here. Our physics courses are also incredibly industry aligned with what our graduates are looking for. In this space, we actually have two courses, we have the new Bachelor of Advanced Science majoring in Quantum Technologies, which is a really big growth area across a whole range of industries, and then we also have the Bachelor of Science in Physics, and what we get our students to do here is, again, get that hands-on experience in the laboratory using some very cutting edge instrumentation. Willa Houston: [00:11:31] Also, a great opportunity is combined degrees. Many of our programs here at UTS Science are offered in the form of a combined degree. So that means that you can graduate with two degrees, and this includes in business, law, international studies, and the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation, and many more. So you might want to look at the combined degree opportunities as well. You should be aware that UTS has an early entry program. You can use your Year 11 results to apply now and you can have an offer even before you finish your HSC exams. So please consider applying to us through the UTS Early Entry Program.

Ask UTS UTS International provides information, advice and application details for future and current international students. Ask a question The Student Centre provide information and advice to future and current students on all administrative matters, including enrolment, recognition of prior learning, timetabling, study plans and progression. Your Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) is a score between 0.00 and 99.95. It shows you how you rank compared to all the students in your year in Australia – so, for example, if your ATAR is 80.00 that means you’re in the top 20 per cent. A selection rank is the combination of your ATAR and any other adjustment factors that make up your overall university entrance score. Most universities will consider your application based on your selection rank rather than on your ATAR alone. Your selection rank may differ from university to university, depending on the adjustment points granted to you at each institution. Adjustment factors (previously known as bonus points) are considerations beyond your ATAR that contribute to your overall selection rank. For example, you could receive adjustment points if you’re from a regional or remote area, if you’re an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, or if you’ve experience socioeconomic disadvantage – any points you receive will be added to your ATAR, increasing your overall selection rank. Here’s how it works: if you’re a year 12 student with an ATAR of 70 and you’re eligible for 10 adjustment points through an equity admissions scheme, your application would be assessed based on an overall selection rank of 80. At UTS, adjustment points can be gained through the following adjustment factor schemes: Year 12 Subject Scheme, inpUTS or the Elite Athlete and Performers Scheme. Once you’ve chosen a course, view the list of UTS courses you’re interested in to see the selection rank. While these numbers may change from year to year, the current year results should give you an idea of the sort of selection rank you’ll need to get into your preferred course. All offers made by UTS are competitive, and they’re based on a limited number of places. The number of applicants and quality of applicants will impact the selection ranks for each course, and the ranks themselves may change from year to year. So, while there’s no one specific number you should be aiming for, the basic rule of thumb is that the higher your selection rank, the better your chances – so focus on getting the best results that you can! The UAC website shows the selection rank needed for entry into a course for any student who completed high school. The ranks on the UTS website show only the rank needed for students who completed high school for the current year. To see a comprehensive breakdown of ranks for high school leavers and non-recent school leavers, please head to our updated admissions stats tool. Don’t panic! If your Selection Rank* wasn’t what you were hoping for, our aptitude assessment can provide an alternative entry into your chosen UTS Science degree. This assessment measures things like critical and analytical thinking and other skills that can demonstrate your aptitude for science. Another option is to choose a similar UTS degree that has a lower Selection Rank* entry score, and apply to transfer into your preferred degree at the end of your first year of study. It’s a competitive process, so make sure you study hard – both your Selection Rank* and your first-year results will be considered as part of your transfer application. There aren’t any pre-requisites. We assume you’ve got an existing level of knowledge when it comes to science and mathematics - that you’ve passed the relevant HSC subjects. However, we encourage you to view the assumed knowledge for the courses you’re interested on the website. If you need a refresher in physics, chemistry or mathematics – see UTS Bridging Courses. If you’re a full-time student, you’ll spend about 20 contact hours a week in your first year of study. You’ll also need to allocate another 20-ish hours to study and prepare for assessments outside of class times, so you should expect to commit about 40 hours a week. If you’re coming straight from high school, the biggest difference is that at uni, you’re treated like an adult. This means being prepared for your classes, participating in group projects, managing your study time and completing assignments by the deadline. Some subjects have a lecture, a tutorial and a laboratory practical. At UTS, we have three sessions or semesters, which are autumn, spring and summer session. Not all classes run in summer session. See UTS academic timetable. There are over 130 clubs and societies at UTS where you can meet like-minded students. You can choose to get involved with as many or as little as you want – the choice is yours. Yes, depending on your degree – not all courses have a mid-year intake. Credit points are the value of each subject or unit of study, and they reflect a common measure of load across all UTS courses. Each subject/unit is normally worth six credit points, but there are some exceptions. A standard full-time load of study usually consists of 48 credit points in one calendar year. Most courses are a combination of core and elective subjects. Core subjects are compulsory, and electives are subjects you choose to study. You can opt for subjects within your study area, or you might want to broaden your skills by taking electives in another UTS faculty. As a Science or Maths student, you can also use your electives to undertake an internship or research project subject. Most UTS courses offer a part-time study option where you’ll study roughly half the subject load of a full-time student. A standard full–time load is 24 credit points per semester, and a standard part-time load is less than 12 credit points. Recognition of prior learning is granted on a case-by-case basis, so you’ll need to apply. If you’ve undertaken previous study at an accredited institution and the subjects you studied were relevant to your UTS degree, then you should be in with a shot. One’s a specialist or named degree, and the other one is a science degree with a specialised majors. In most cases, the two study programs will be similar, but you will notice some subject differences in years 2 and 3. In the Medical Science degree, you also have a choice of 2 majors. You’ll probably need a higher Selection Rank* to get into the specialist/named degree. The Bachelor of Science is more flexible, if you decide to change your major. The Bachelor of Molecular Biotechnology offers majors in Medical Biotechnology and Environmental Biotechnology, as well as more cross-disciplinary subjects in both business and laws. The Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology is a more flexible degree. If you’re not unsure on what you want to specialise in, the Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology, or any of its major – is a safe bet. Once you’ve completed your UTS Science or Maths undergraduate degree, you can apply for a Master of Teaching in Secondary Education, also at UTS. This degree combines teaching theory, methodologies and practical experience, and will prepare you to teach science, maths or both in NSW secondary schools. If you’ve completed the required undergraduate degree and specialist subjects, you can complete the course in 2 years of full-time study or 1.5 years in accelerated mode. Ask a question or request an appointment with a UTS Science staff member by contacting us at Ask UTS. Better yet, attend one of our open day or info day where you can talk to academics and current students. If you have completed a TAFE Certificate IV in Laboratory Techniques (MSL40118) or a Diploma in Laboratory Technologies (MSL50118) then you will be eligible for recognition of prior learning (RPL). Up to 24cp will be automatically credited towards the Faculty of Science Bachelor’s degrees as shown below. Please note that for other courses not included in this document Recognition of prior learning is granted on a case-by-case basis, so you’ll need to apply. Please note that RPL does not always result in a reduction in the length of the degree. Students may be required to undertake a reduced study load in some sessions. Program schedules will vary depending on student commencement date and other subject selection. Students enrolling in UTS Faculty of Science Bachelor’s degrees who have previously completed a Certificate IV in Laboratory Techniques (MSL40118) or a Diploma in Laboratory Technologies (MSL50118) are eligible for 18cp or 24 credit points of recognition of prior learning (RPL). The following subjects will be automatically credited towards the Bachelor’s degrees shown below. Please note that for all other courses not included in this document students will be assessed on an individual basis. SAU will contact Program Director for assessment.

https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/short-courses/uts-institute-data-intensive-courses/institute-data-learner-perspectives,"Airline Pilot – Dominique Cotte successfully transitioned her career during COVID-19 to the cyber security industry by becoming trained through our part-time cyber security program. Prior to pursuing studies with the Institute of Data, I was an International wide-body jet pilot for Emirates Airline – 4 years on Boeing 777. I’ve also flown for Tigerair Australia. My career over the past 17 years has been in the aviation industry. In terms of prior qualifications, I have a bachelor’s in aviation technology from Swinburn Hawthorn. I was introduced to IoD’s Cybersecurity program through my sister actually – she is a travel agent for cricket in Australia who recommended it to me. I thought it was a great transition from aviation especially due to my experiences in risk management, threat & error management, and critical thinking ability. In addition, my previous focus on international standards, regulation and safety management was very helpful in my career transition. I was always interested in moving into coding or studying another career path alongside my aviation career. The pandemic consolidated my need for this. Cybersecurity was also thriving during the pandemic! There were so many jobs becoming available worldwide, revealing a great opportunity for myself and many others I did find that my lack of IT and cyber past experience was a challenge. I had great practical knowledge gained from the Institute of Data program, however for a few months, I was rejected and did not have any interview opportunities. My breakthrough was when I personally reached out to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of Qantas. We established a great relationship over time and she provided me guidance and insight into how I could position myself better in job application from the perspective of a Cyber Security professional. Due to this, I did land the opportunity with QBE. It definitely helps having the right connections. What is also important is being open & proactive to receiving guidance from professionals who can help you find a job in the industry. There are numerous ways individuals can prepare for a Cyber Security interview. Here are a few tips that I would suggest: Learn more and explore roles in cyber security here and here. It has been a humbling experience starting a completely new career. I have had to develop skill sets I haven’t used in some time and face new challenges. I’ve realised there is a lot of room to grow and develop within Cybersecurity. With hard work, I’m determined and driven to learn as much as I can. I definitely have a better work/life balance compared to my time working as an airline pilot. Now, I can come home, spend time with friends and family far more often and have more stability in my life. My capstone project was focused on a suggestion my lead trainer gave me. It was suggested for me to base my project around something that I wanted to work in – for me, I wanted to work in risk. I really enjoyed the process – it honestly surprised me how much I had learned about the topic from the moment I started to the moment I presented it in class. It was a great opportunity to hone my studies in an area I was motivated in. It also made my capstone project far more interesting. The program gave me far more clarity and understanding about the industry, where Cybersecurity is heading in the future and modern day threats associated with technology advances. It also gave me a great insight into where my strengths lie and how I could utilise my strengths in the Cyber Security space. The program also taught me how to develop and learn the required practical skills for the job. Many of the technical and interpersonal skills that were taught to me were actually very applicable and relevant. I enjoyed the challenge of learning and up-skilling especially as a mature age student. I learned so much from my counterparts, and loved the community we created throughout the program. I felt supported by our trainers and learned so much. They put in extra time to support each one of us throughout the course which I am very grateful for. Their guidance allowed me to understand every component of the program as we progressed. If you are interested in up-skilling and landing a role in the Cyber Security industry, book a consultation with a Data Industry Career Consultant today. The travel industry sadly ground to a halt with the onslaught of COVID19. I saw the fast-growing cyber security industry offering an exciting, interesting and challenging work scape so I made the pivot. Cybersecurity has a skills shortage and needs diversity in professionals who can bring open-mindedness, unique thinking and experiences as well as much needed soft skills to bring cyber awareness out of the basement and into the board room. What I’ve enjoyed the most is seeing where business goals and cybersecurity intersect to support risk strategies and enable businesses to grow with confidence. My trainer Michael is instrumental in bringing real world experiences to the classroom, helping me to see past the theory and into the office with everything I’ve learned. I’m excited and grateful for the opportunity to join Triskele Labs. I began looking at cybersecurity jobs when I started the course. My advice is, don’t wait until you’re finished. When I decide to pursue something, there’s no looking back - no hesitation, just discovery, delivery and drive. I made the effort to ask lots of questions and unpack all the areas of cybersecurity. I began to see where my strengths and experiences leant best. When I started applying for jobs and had discussions with people in the industry, I became aware of the difficulty to break into cyber security. For all that there’s a skills shortage and our industry’s in need, it’s a challenging one to start out in. I believe in living for your work and not working to live.... To join the cyber industry, you need to push yourself to get a foot in the door and craft how you can grow and pivot. My advice to anyone joining the industry is; before you know what you want to do, you need to know who you are. Start with that - define who you are, let that grow into who you want to be. From there, you can start to answer where you want to be in your professional life. It’s a lot easier to pinpoint the how from there. Be ready to shift your perceptions and assumptions. The industry has opportunities for people from all sorts of backgrounds. Wherever you’re coming from, you need to be able to break down what you’re good at into key components and demonstrate how they are relatable, transferable or complementary to the cybersecurity industry. Be self-aware to know how to deliver. Lastly, talk to as many cybersecurity folks as you can. Network, connect and have conversations. The greatest thing to propel you in the industry will be your peers. No amount of qualifications, hours or skills will make you better than someone who can develop great relationships. It’s all about Level of Preparation. Dial it up to 11. Off the chart. If you don’t feel over prepared, you’re not ready. Make sure you can articulate your story. Have a clear understanding of who you are, what you want, why you want it, where you’re going, what you can contribute and what you’re willing to do to make it work. Know as much about your prospective employer, company and its staff as you can. You need to know who you are interviewing for. I make sure I’m interviewing the employer as well. They need to be the right fit for me too. In line with who I am, supportive of my ambition and direction as well as share a mutual belief of possibilities. Enrol in the Institute of Data cyber program with UTS today. But be open minded, round out your learning- make it interactive, structured, self-driven and connected. Build solid relationships with peers and other professionals. Always be clear on your intentions. Someone will be willing to help if you can demonstrate a desire to help yourself. Six months ago, all I saw was the crash-landing travel industry. Now, I see more possibilities than ever before. One of the exciting things about the beginning of this journey is that there’s such an incredible opportunity to learn, grow and move within the cyber industry. From roles that are super technical, to people focused and everything in between. The course validated there isn’t a pre-requisite amount of technical skill to start your cyber journey. One thing increasingly clear is that there is not a ‘type’, ‘one best way’ or ‘one size fits all’ for what’s required. Curiosity goes a long way. Be ready to work really hard and know there’s a great reward in doing so. If you are interested in up-skilling and landing a role in the Cyber Security industry, book a consultation with a Data Industry Career Consultant today. My career background is predominantly in the IT space – as a COBOL developer and application development team leader & manager. I have been self employed for a few years prior to up-skilling with this program – running my own business on Amazon and publishing books over the years. I do also have a diploma in management – PMP (PMI). Prior to up-skilling, I didn’t have any concrete career goals. I was working for myself for some time and was more aiming for a change in my career path – hence why I transitioned my career. The reason why I chose the part-time program is because I had other commitments that did clash with the full-time program, it allowed me to balance everything in my life easier. Part-time class hours suited my schedule better. In hindsight, I could have stretched myself to complete the full-time course though. I landed the new role through many, many applications, sending emails with expressions of interest, contacting local MPs, and even contacting previous employers from Ireland. It was through my own hard efforts as well as the practical skills & careers guidance that I was able to land the position at the end of the day. I sent an EOI for a role that I actually didn’t qualify for – they wanted an Australian citizenship which I don’t have. I did mention this in my letter. Thankfully, they actually had other positions in the company that didn’t need citizenship! It was a great learning experience because it made me realise I need to be creative, not be blinkered in what I’m applying for, and focus on the roles and/or companies that I’d like to work for – not just the role. That would be what I would suggest to other people who are applying for cybersecurity positions. I am way better off! I’m employed now, previously was not employed. I’m really loving my experience with the company and looking forward to growing in my new sphere of experience over the next 6-12 months. One thing I wish I knew before changing careers to cyber was how vast the industry is! It may have helped if I had narrowed down where I did want to land-up in. My particular project was difficult because there was very little documentation on SD. I managed to get the proof on concept, load all the existing rules, and execute various tests. However, without the documentation available, I could not find specifically how the rules were interpreted or worked. It taught me that some tools are not necessarily the be-all-and-end-all. If one doesn’t fit the bill, then try others. Time constraints in my case, prevented that. I gained valuable presentation and reporting skills out of the project. I enjoyed the scope of areas the program covered, and therefore the variety of skills to learn. I also enjoyed being in a position to learn as much as I can to protect myself and others from potential cyber attacks. If you are interested in up-skilling and landing a role in the Cyber Security industry, book a consultation with a Data Industry Career Consultant today.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/pharmacy-courses/subjects-and-clinical-placements,"Join us in 2023 Info session Course guide (PDF) Enquire now As a Pharmacy student, you can expect to combine the study of therapeutics and pharmaceutical sciences with the theory and practice of designing, developing, implementing and evaluating professional pharmacy services. Students have the option to choose electives that reflect their professional interests and will prepare them for the career they want. Please note that Master of Pharmacy (International) includes International Placement 1 and International Placement 2 in addition to the above subjects. UTS is known for its innovation. And this is evident in our partnership with Westmead Hospital., where instead of taking the hospital to the university, we've brought the students to the hospital. So UTS is really known for its innovation. It's really cutting edge in terms of its resources and one of the areas that we've been demonstrating that is with our partnership with Westmead Hospital. So instead of taking the hospital to the university, we've brought the students to the hospital. Westmead Hospital is one of the largest teaching hospitals in Australia, servicing over a million people in Western Sydney. Our partnership with UTS provides a unique opportunity for pharmacy students to experience the breadth and depth of hospital pharmacy practise that is otherwise not able to be undertaken as part of a traditional hospital pharmacy placement. The Advanced Clinical Pharmacy elective's really interesting. So there's no lectures, there's no workshops, there's no formal classes. So what they're gaining is the opportunity to consolidate and to continue their learning but in a self-directed way. So they're learning to react as a pharmacist in that real-world setting. From an employer perspective, it has been refreshing to watch the students grow and develop during their time with us, in particular, their clinical judgement and confidence in hospital pharmacy practise. Being in the hospital setting and part of the pharmacy team, students develop their patient-centred care skills, they develop their critical thinking and their clinical judgement skills, and they really learn how to be a pharmacist. So what I'm enjoying about the Advanced Clinical Pharmacy elective is that you get to take that theoretical knowledge that you learn every day at UTS in the classroom and apply it to a practical setting here at Westmead Hospital. - I think this elective has really helped me understand the patient perspective, so it's really prepared me as a future pharmacist. This elective's already helped me in my career. I've got an internship for next year in hospital pharmacy. It's also given me an opportunity to talk to different pharmacists who are in different roles and different stages of their careers and just see where it's possible to go with a career in pharmacy. Master of Pharmacy students experience a diverse range of clinical placement opportunities. Students complete approximately 520 hours over the two year program, ranging from half day per week placements during teaching sessions to block placements during session breaks. Enquire now All placements are generally sourced for students by UTS Pharmacy. Occasionally students may choose to source their own clinical placement (around a particular area of interest or location, for example), but most prefer to take advantage of provided placements as these sites are carefully selected to complement in-class learning. Students are allocated placements within the Sydney metropolitan and greater Sydney areas. Opportunities to undertake placements in rural and regional settings are also available for students. Our partner pharmacies are located across the Sydney metropolitan and greater Sydney areas, from Hornsby in the North to Wollongong in the South; from Manly in the East to Penrith in the West. Hospital pharmacy Our hospital pharmacy partners include some of Sydney's largest teaching hospitals as well as settings in rural and regional Australia. Students also have the option to pursue career interests outside the traditional areas of hospital and community pharmacy. Specialist settings can include: Pharmacy Consultancy (e.g.Meditrax ) Pharmaceutical Industry Government Professional Organisations (e.g. National Prescribing Service) Specialist Clinics (e.g. respiratory, oncology, drug and alcohol) Research Female 1: For two days I got to go to Nimbin. They have a multi-facility there where they have aged care and they have a few emergency departments, something that I've never seen before. It was a really great experience. Everyone is just so willing to help and so much more enthusiastic Male 1: What I like best about the program is being able to learn with other healthcare professionals and work on a case together and solve the patient's problem - all as a team. They've got a holistic and multi-disciplinary approach to the whole thing. They had a conference at the end and it really benefitted the patient to get all that collaborative effort to manage their pain properly. I thought that was really good. Female 2: Being here with a Parkinson's patient and some of the changes we made in his medications, they followed him back to the hospital and he was just doing so much better the next time we saw him. He was really grateful and it was an awesome experience. Female 3: Here at the University Centre for Rural Health we have a six to eight week program for pharmacy students. As part of that program they undertake placements in community pharmacies, hospital pharmacy and we organise a number of multi-disciplinary activities for them. Male 2: Within the constraints that we've got here at the Lismore Base Hospital - as broader an introduction to hospital pharmacy as we possibly can. Within the program, every day there's some learning objectives, so that I will try and sit down with the student at the end of the day and we will go through the previous day's learning objectives. Then at the end of their placement, we like to give the students a bit of a challenge and I try to organise for them to do a case study. Then they'll present the work that they've done on that case study to the pharmacists at one of our weekly clinical pharmacist meetings. So it's a good learning exercise for the students and it's a good learning exercise for us as well. Female 2: Today we came out to a little school in Woodenbong and we gave a little presentation on healthy eating. Female 4: After we finished our presentation we took them out and played a little game with them, which they had lots of fun doing. Then we had a healthy lunch and a little handball that we could give them afterwards. It was so good for us to tell all the kids about how important it is to eat healthy because hospitals and specialists are so hard to come by out here. Female 2: It was really fun for us to be able to tell them a bit about us and what we do and tell them that they can go and see their pharmacist and I think a lot of the kids found that pretty interesting. Female 3: The students find that rural living is fun. They find that the rural practitioners are welcoming, friendly, helpful and that they are prepared to spend a lot of time with them. Male 3: Pharmacy students while they're here will see a number of things. Particularly what we're interested in exposing them to is dosing in the public sector. So a chance to give them a real good heads up for a day on addiction medicine I think is both beneficial for them and beneficial for us in the future. Female 5: What we do here in Nimbin is a little bit unique and different. We approach it with a very holistic type of view. It allows the pharmacy student to see that in a different light. So instead of just seeing it strictly as this diagnosed case, they see it as this human being and he's working with respect and trust to improve and have positive outcomes. That occurs all the time here in the NIS program. Male 4: We are a community pharmacy and Aboriginal people are an important of our community. Female 3: The patients are very willing to contribute to the students' learning, as are the clinicians. So the students get a wonderful learning opportunity. They get to do hands on work. They're not just observers. They get totally engrossed and involved. They're allowed to go on home medicine review. They're allowed to interview patients at the hospital. They participate in our inter-professional learning workshop where they actually work with students who are from medicine, from nursing and from other Allied Health professions. Many students come to the Northern Rivers never having been to a rural area before. Male 5: Coming from the city and coming here, it's a different change. Just because there's a lack of resources and you're applying more of your knowledge. I feel that they appreciate it much more.e Female 6: So it's really good that we're able to bring our knowledge to the table. But then also we have students from other disciplines bringing their knowledge and we're able to learn off each other. So we're giving the patient the best care possible. I found that really beneficial, not only to my learning but also to patient care. Male: 6: I guess we've only been touching on the surface because we've been here only a few days. But in that time so far I've met really great people, especially the students that we have to stay with. On top of that from the little hospital experience that I've had, it's that rural hospitality that's really good out here. I'm really looking forward to the rest of the time here. Year 1 is spent in the same community pharmacy for all placements Autumn Session - Community pharmacy 1/2 day per week Session break (June/July) - Community pharmacy 2 week block (full-time) Spring Session - Community pharmacy 1/2 day per week Year 2 is spent in a range of practice settings: Summer session break (December, January, February) - Hospital pharmacy (2 weeks of dedicated on-campus orientation to clinical practice plus 2 weeks hospital pharmacy pending placement availability) Summer session break (January, February) – Community pharmacy or alternative and specialist settings (see above for examples) (2 weeks) Winter session break (June/July) – Community pharmacy, hospital pharmacy or alternative and specialist settings (4 weeks) Detailed information on clinical placement requirements and logistics including uniform, vaccinations and more can be found on the UTS Current Students site.

During this final session students complete the 3D animated short film and any other outstanding projects to industry standards. At the end of the session we celebrate with our End of Year Showcase, where we invite key industry partners to view the incredible work the students’ accomplished throughout the year, and give students the opportunity to network with potential future employers. Students graduate with professional level projects which regularly win national and international awards, with shots and breakdowns they can feature on their showreels, which dramatically improves their ability to find work in specialised industry roles at the level of professional industry artists, required to complete designated tasks and roles. For further details about the structure and details of the course, including learning outcomes and credit point allocations for the Masters of Animation and Visualisation, please visit the UTS Handbook page. Numbers vary from year to year, but we anticipate around 30-40 enrolments. The Animal Logic Academy leaders are all highly experienced industry professionals, with decades of experience producing award winning work. You can see details about the backgrounds of our awesome team leaders on the Meet the Animal Logic team page. Each year we produce a high-fidelity animation project and a completed emerging media project. You can see a selection of these on our Projects page. Students also develop prototypes for emerging technologies projects such as VR, AR, mixed realty and/or real-time technology in Studio 2. The Master of Animation and Visualisation is an accelerated qualification where we pack 2 years of learning into 1 year of full-time study (with 3 sessions a year rather than 2 semesters), combined with a 5-day-a-week workload. So even though the masters costs around the same as other similar qualifications, you are out in the workforce 1 year earlier earning a salary. Cost information is centralised over the UTS fees page, where you will have to enter the relevant course information to get the current course fees.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/business-courses/study-business-analytics,"Study Business Analytics at UTS Business School Apply Now Businesses able to make better decisions using data will be the ones that prosper in global, highly competitive markets awash with information. Professionals who want to succeed in a data-driven world will not only understand the numbers but also be able to communicate insights and prescribe action. These two strands come together in UTS’s new Master of Business Analytics, designed to meet the needs of professionals with either a business or an IT background who are looking for a boundary-crossing degree to take them forward. In addition to the on-campus Master degree, UTS offers a choice of online Master of Business Analytics, as well as Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma (exit-only) and Extension Master degrees, allowing you to choose the level of study and investment that best fits your needs. I looked into an MBA, but then I came across the business analytics program at UTS. I saw that there was a good balance of practical experience — you learn something and then you implement it in real life. All the subjects involved projects that you can put in your portfolio. There’s interrelation between the different subjects, too — you can use a concept from one course and implement it in another. They don’t teach you anything you don’t need because the programs are really suited to the needs of industry. Nothing you learn is obsolete. F M Farhan Faiyaz, Master of Business Analytics (Extension) Within Australia and around the world there is a critical shortage of people with deep analytical, data management and interpretation skills, with one recent survey indicating 40 percent of companies struggling to find and retain their data analytics talent. Business analytics allows you to undertake three core analytical tasks that add value to organisations: Diagnostic: reporting on what has happened and identifying the causes behind it Predictive: understanding what is happening and using this to make educated predictions as to what is likely to happen in the future Prescriptive: identifying a course of action for an organisation to undertake, in response to a predicted outcome or range of outcomes It is this latter task that adds the most value to organisations, and is a key focus of the program The UTS Business Analytics program is designed for professionals working in, or seeking to enter, the fields of marketing, economics and economic modelling, operations, accounting, finance and information technology. Background degrees may vary according to professional background and include business, economics, mathematics, IT, Information Science etc. For professionals without a completed undergraduate degree but with significant relevant experience, the Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics offers an entry pathway through which you can progress to the Master of Business Analytics. The course is delivered in blended mode, combining contemporary online and face-to-face learning experiences in UTS’s leading-edge facilities. A unique feature of the Business Analytics program is the inclusion of studios, where students apply the technical skills they developed onto real-world projects. Studio classes are intensive, running for a whole day and allowing for you to deep-dive into a project whilst being mentored and guided by leading academics and practitioners. All students in the Master of Business Analytics complete an introductory subject, Foundations of Business Analytics, and a Programming Languages stream consisting of three subjects, that gives you a working knowledge of SAS, R and Python. These four introductory subjects total 12 credit points. The three studios run throughout your studies, forming the backbone of the program, and make up a total of 24 credit points, or a third of the Master of Business Analytics. If you have a business, commerce or similar prior degree, you will assigned to the Foundation in IT stream, consisting of two 6-credit-point subjects: Database Principles, and Enabling Enterprise Information Systems. Alternatively, if your degree was in IT, computer science or similar, you will be assigned to the Foundation in Business stream, consisting of four 3-credit-point subjects: Delivering Customer Value; Accounting Practices and Tools; Applied Financial Management; and Sustainable Enterprise in Dynamic Systems. From there, you are free to choose your specialisation stream(s), normally consisting of 12 credit points each. Specialisation stream options include: Alternatively you can choose to do either 12 or 24 credit points of electives of subjects chosen from the various stream areas and from throughout the University. The Master of Business Analytics consists of: C = Core subject, E = Elective subject All students in the Master of Business Analytics complete an introductory subject, Foundations of Business Analytics, and a Programming Languages stream consisting of three subjects, that gives you a working knowledge of SAS, R and Python. These four introductory subjects total 12 credit points. The three studios run throughout your studies, forming the backbone of the program, and make up a total of 24 credit points, or a third of the Master of Business Analytics. If you have a business, commerce or similar prior degree, you would then choose the Foundation for Business stream, consisting of two 6-credit-point subjects: Database Principles, and Enabling Enterprise Information Systems. Alternatively, if your degree was in IT, computer science or similar, you would choose the Foundation for IT stream, consisting of four 3-credit-point subjects: Delivering Customer Value; Accounting Practices and Tools; Applied Financial Management; and Sustainable Enterprise in Dynamic Systems From there, you are free to choose your specialisation stream(s), normally consisting of 12 credit points each. Specialisation stream options include: Alternatively you can choose to do either 12 or 24 credit points of electives of subjects chosen from the various stream areas and from throughout the University. To gain entry into the Master of Business Analytics you must have a recognised bachelor's degree in a cognate field within the business or information technology disciplines. You do not require any additional previous experience in business analytics, although applicants with significant relevant professional experience but without a degree may be eligible to enter into the Graduate Certificate of Business Analytics. Teaching staff come from a range of fields at UTS, including Accounting, Economics, Finance, Marketing and Management within UTS Business School, School of Electrical and Data Engineering, School of Computer Science, and School of Information, Systems and Modelling from the Faculty of Engineering and IT and also subjects from the Faculty of Transdisciplinary Innovation.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/orthoptics-courses/orthoptics-student-profiles/jacinta-walz-0,"I completed a Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) in vision science and mathematics, and during my second and third years studying, I undertook two research internships. I also worked as a research assistant for eight months within the Optometry and Vision Science field. My work there looked at traumatic brain injury (TBI, such as concussions and more serious brain injuries) and the consequences that these injuries have on visual processing, eye movements, and particularly visual attention which is how your brain prioritises all the visual information it is processing according to what’s most important. This work was the precursor to my Honours year and thesis which delved further into visual attention, how we allocate attention to different pieces of visual information, and how this is affected by TBI. I met the Head of Discipline in Orthoptics during my first year and over the course of my study came to realise that orthoptics offered the best combination of the areas that I’m interested in with long-term, patient-focused care and therapeutics. I am passionate about so many different things. Orthoptics piqued my interest because it combined some of those passions: vision, neurology, service, and patient-focused relationships. I’m passionate about learning and research which challenge me to think laterally, critically, and creatively to come up with unique solutions to unexplored questions. I’m passionate about serving the people I encounter, aiding and supporting them in whatever way I can. More recently, I’ve become passionate about low vision and blindness accessibility. There are so many obstacles that the low vision community in terms of access to resources, security, and safety because the way our society is structured relies heavily on visual information. If there is anything that I can do to remove those obstacles, or to make navigating them easier, I would like to do it. I was studying vision science in my undergraduate degree with a view to do optometry. I found as I was making my way through the clinical subjects that there was something missing. The field seemed quite commercial and lacked the kind of long-term care and patient relationships that I was looking for. At a Careers Panel for the vision science student, the Head of Discipline in Orthoptics at UTS came and spoke to us about the field. I’d never even heard the word orthoptics before, let alone know what orthoptics is, but it intrigued me, so I started doing some research. I found that orthoptics offered the more intentional therapeutic relationship I was after, in the context of the vision field I loved, and in combination with more of the neurology which had excited me in my studies so far. In short, Orthoptics offered the opportunity for in-depth, long-term patient relationships in an area I am deeply interested in, and passionate about. There are only two universities in Australia that offer Orthoptics as a program, and only UTS offered a Master of Orthoptics, rather than another bachelors degree. I already lived in Sydney, so it was a bit of a no-brainer for me. This last semester we’ve been learning about neurological ocular disorders, which I have been loving. We've been looking at traumatic brain injuries, strokes, and degenerative neurological conditions (like Parkinson’s disease) and the way they affect vision, and particularly eye movements. Because a very large proportion of the brain is devoted to processing visual information, visual symptoms are very common in neurological conditions and so learning about how all the different signs and symptoms interplay with the systemic symptoms that come with different types of strokes, for example, has been challenging but exciting. I’m looking forward to using this knowledge during placement and seeing patients clinically. The most rewarding aspect of the course for me is being on placement and watching all the theory and understanding I’ve gained over the last 18 months being used in practice. Having worked towards this for so long, including my undergraduate degree, being able to tangibly live out the skills and knowledge is incredibly gratifying, and I can honestly say that I love what I do. The program is very intensive and there’s a lot of work involved. Honestly, it’s no easy feat and finding the right balance is definitely a dynamic learning process as the workload fluctuates throughout the semester but thanks to my support network, I have a lot of accountability for resting and making time for my wellbeing. I’ve made it my mission to come out the end of this degree, not only qualified, but also a whole person, so I have had to make sure I’m taking care of myself in all facets of my life, not just my career. Part of that, for me, has meant submitting assignments a bit early when possible (e.g., Saturday night instead of Sunday night) to preserve some time for my family and friends, or for alone time to exercise, read a good book, play the piano, or listen to some music. Keeping that self-care time has been incredibly important for my mental health. I have been studying under a hybrid online/in-person mode of learning throughout this degree and my experiences have been mostly positive. Last year, through the toughest lockdown, we couldn’t do our in-person clinical skills classes and the learning experience got quite lonely without seeing my friends and classmates regularly, but we managed to pull through it. The online zoom lectures and workshops have served their purpose well, and not having to commute to class certainly makes the mornings easier! But I miss in-person lectures. I learn better when I can talk more freely in a classroom and the relationships with my classmates are stronger when we’re working in-person too. In the immediate future, I would like to get some clinical experience under my belt, especially in the neurology and neuro-ophthalmology space because those areas pique my interest the most. But ultimately, I would like to pursue research, complete a doctorate in the area, and possibly teach further down the track as well. I know that research is the space that allows me the creativity and learning that I thrive on, so I know that will be a part of my future, but I want to make sure that my work there is having an impact on my patients, so having a clinical background to support that research is important to me. The course is challenging, there’s no doubt about that, it will take a lot of hard work, so you need to be prepared for that. But if you come in ready to jump in with both feet, and if you’ve found your niche like I have, it makes the work a lot easier to manage. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. I think there can be a lot of fear and uncertainty in the classroom and some people don’t want to appear stupid by answering incorrectly or asking a question, which is a natural insecurity to have because learning is an inherently vulnerable experience. But I have far more respect for someone who is prepared to give something a go and ends up saying the wrong thing, than for someone who hides in the background. You won’t learn nearly as well if you don’t give yourself those opportunities to be vulnerable and admit that you don’t know. Make friends with your classmates and work together. There is no point in holding up the old-school competitive thing about marks, you’re much better off working collaboratively, listening to one another and supporting each other – both with learning and with life. And at the end of the day, you are more than your mark or your degree. Make sure you’re prioritising your wellbeing as a whole person, because the degree won’t matter at all if you completely fall apart at the end.

Get our info pack Sport business managers, like their peers in other industries, strategise about market share in dynamic and highly competitive national and global markets. They seek to attract and retain talented and creative employees. They oversee commercial partnerships, marketing and media programs, as well as community relationships. Sport managers may act as player agents or union representatives or, within a club, be responsible for the wellbeing of athletes and their transition after sport. Thus, their roles may be both corporate in nature and focused on community and wellbeing. More than ever, the global sport marketplace is in need of professionals with managerial and commercial nous but also sport-specific knowledge. UTS is the leading provider of sport management education in Sydney, with its Master of Sport Management attracting people from within the sport industry undergoing professional development, as well as those with commercial and managerial acumen looking to enter that dynamic environment. Associate Professor Nico Schulenkorf 0:06 Hello there, my name is Nico Schulenkorf and I'm the Course Director for Masters of Sport Management here at UTS. Here at UTS, we teach a range of postgraduate programs in Sport Management and options include a Graduate Certificate, a Graduate Diploma, or a full Master's degree. In our courses, we discuss critical managerial issues for a variety of sport projects. Specifically, our programs feature subjects that develop sport management knowledge across areas such as Business Studies, Globalization, Governance, Marketing, Media Development, Technology, Innovation, and Social impact. For instance, in our Sport, Governance and Integrity unit, we discuss issues around match-fixing, doping, betting, and corruption. In our Sports and Event Globalization class, we'll look at topics such as global athlete migration, the use of labour in developing countries and associated sweatshop debates, and also the topic of sport for development. So overall, our courses are designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills to operate and lead in the increasingly complex and dynamic sport industry. Importantly, the courses are designed for students from diverse backgrounds and are delivered using flexible learning methods and therefore making it suitable for working professionals as well as domestic and international students.

The blend of business and sport-specific subjects prepared me for the role I currently hold, giving me the business experience I needed to run an organisation. During my degree I undertook a Master’s research project aimed at identifying the challenges experienced by women working in professional roles in the National Rugby League. This research not only helped inform female engagement strategies for the sport but gave me a platform to engage in further research work once I finished at UTS, The world of sport is ever changing and the Master of Sport Management well equips students to move with the times while understanding the foundations of sport, how it operates and how to manage it.

https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/current-students-information-faculty-design-architecture-and-building/manage-your-course/courses-and-subjects,"The UTS Handbook is the best source of information for all DAB courses and subjects. Most DAB postgraduate courses have a mid-year intake. To confirm that the postgraduate course you are interested in has a mid-year intake refer to the DAB postgraduate course list. DAB undergraduate courses currently have no mid-year intake. All Architecture and Design undergraduate degrees are offered as full-time courses only. Property Economics and Construction project management degrees may be undertaken part-time. All postgraduate courses may be studied part-time and many are offered as full-time courses. See the UTS Handbook for typical programs. When a student's enrolment in a session is less than 18 credit points worth of subjects, the student's load for that session is considered to be a part-time load. Conversely a student's load is considered to be a full-time load when the enrolment in the session is 18 credit points or more. Students who commence a session with a full-time enrolment load may withdraw from subjects up to the census date for that session. Students are required to complete course requirements within an approved maximum time limit. The maximum time to complete a course is generally calculated as no more than (50) per cent longer than the normal completion time for the course. Current UTS students can apply to undertake concurrent study (PDF, 79kB). Approval for Concurrent Study means that a UTS student is approved to study particular subjects at another institution and on successful completion of this study, credit will be awarded towards their UTS degree. This credit may be in form of Unspecified Credit or Subject Exemption(s) - depending on the approval received when the Concurrent study application is originally assessed. Students approved for concurrent study by UTS must also make formal application to the university at which they wish to study. On successful completion of concurrent study it is the student's responsibility to submit the completed Subject exemption application for concurrent study (PDF, 33kB) to UTS with your official transcript (original or certified copy). Undergraduate students may select subjects from other faculties when choosing their elective subjects. Up until the second week of each session and where class space permits, students may amend their class registration from one class to another using ""My Subject Activities"". Students can log onto My Subject Activities from My Student Admin. Students are not permitted to undertake additional subjects within their course. If a student wishes to enrol in a subject which is additional to their course requirements they may apply to enrol into the subject as a non award study. A normal full-time load for DAB students is 24 credit points (24cp). Web enrolment will permit students to enrol themselves into subjects up to 28cp. Occasionally students may request to enrol into an additional subject in the session up to 32 credit points. Requests to exceed credit points can be made using eRequest. Exceed credit point requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the reason, the student's academic record and class place availability. A student's study plan reflects the normal completion requirements for their course. Students can only web enrol into subjects which are offered on their study plan. Where a course allows free elective choice, for example within our undergraduate degrees, students may use eRequest to add a subject to their study plan from outside the normal DAB subject list. Students web-enrolling into these electives will be subject to the normal constraints relating to prerequisites and class place availability. If your course allows open electives, then you may select undergraduate subjects from across the university, including subjects offered by UTS: International Studies. To be able to enrol into cross-faculty electives you must meet any prerequisites put in place by the owning faculty. You should be aware that some subjects from other faculties are 8 credit point subjects and not 6 credit points as offered by DAB. You need to make up a total of 24cp to pass the year. You may also be given permission to enrol into subjects at another tertiary institution and to have the subjects credited back to their UTS degree, known as concurrent study. UTS: International Studies offer Language and Culture programs in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and Spanish which are available to be studied as electives in any of our undergraduate degrees. Students in the combined degrees with International Studies will study at least 32 credit points of Language and Culture subjects as a requirement of their degree. Official reading lists for subjects will be advised on subject outlines given to enrolled students at the beginning of each session by the subject coordinator. The UTS Handbook has subject descriptions which may include reading lists, texts or references - it should be noted that these lists are subject to change and the official reading list is the one advised on the subject outline produced for the applicable session and given to students in class. Subject outlines are given to students when they attend their first class. Any questions regarding subject outlines should be directed to the relevant subject coordinator. The UTS Handbook provides subject descriptions for many DAB subjects - these are not subject outlines but provide very useful information for students when deciding their subject choices. Further information is available through Canvas once you have enrolled. Canvas is a Teaching/Learning tool used in many subjects - it is not the official enrolment system of the University. Not all UTS subjects make use Canvas. Canvas allows you to check whether or not a subject uses it. You will need your student ID and UTS password to log into Canvas. Not all UTS subjects make use of Canvas so you must first check that the particular subject is using it for the session. If the subject you are enrolled into is using Canvas and you have allowed 24 hours from your actual time of enrolment, then you should email your subject coordinator to ask them to add you manually. The IT Helpdesk can assist you with any technical issues you may be experiencing. Assignments submitted throughout the session would normally be returned during class. Final assignments may be collected in week 4 of the following session. Assignments which remain uncollected after this time will be disposed of according to University guidelines. You must apply for a leave of absence before the Census date of the session in which you wish to commence your leave. All students can apply for leave of absence by logging into My Student Admin (select Subjects tab > Leave of absence in the left hand column). Leave of absence may be approved if you have completed and passed at least one subject in a course and where the application is made before the applicable Census date for the session. Census dates for each session (meaning the last day to withdraw from subjects without financial penalty) are published each year in the online handbook. UTS’s Global Exchange program allows you to study overseas for one or two sessions at a UTS partner university in Asia, Europe or the Americas. Undergraduate students should have completed at least two sessions of their course before going on exchange but planning and applying can start earlier.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/undergraduate-psychology/faqs,"An undergraduate psychology degree is the first step towards registration as a psychologist (although you’ll need to complete honours and postgraduate study, too) — but working towards registration as a psychologist is just one career path that this qualification can lead to. You’ll also be ready for a wide range of jobs that require an understanding of human behaviour, social dynamics, and complex systems. The UTS Bachelor of Psychology is a new degree with our first intake in Autumn 2024. For a general guide on the selection rank requirement, you can refer to other undergraduate psychology degrees at universities near UTS — ours is likely to be in line with these. The course has no subject prerequisites, but you’ll benefit from a solid grounding in Science, Maths, and English. First-year lectures and tutorials all take place in person at the UTS City Campus, which is just a short walk from Sydney’s Central Station. From second year onwards, you’ll engage with a mix of face-to-face and online learning. There are lots of psychology degrees out there. What makes the UTS Bachelor of Psychology special? We’re glad you asked! There are lots of things that make our degree stand out, including extensive industry partnerships, the opportunity to engage Indigenous cultural competence, and access to six psychology subjects in first year compared to two in most other undergraduate psychology degrees. Read more about what sets the UTS course apart Psychology graduates work across a range of settings, from solo private practice to group private practice and in schools, community mental health services, hospitals and more. If you’re planning to work as a registered psychologist, you’ll need to complete further study in addition to your bachelor’s degree in order to meet Australian registration requirements. Read more about how to become a psychologist in Australia But working as a psychologist is just one of many careers you can pursue. When you graduate with a Bachelor of Psychology, you’ll be armed with a fundamental understanding of human behaviour and cognition that’s in high demand across countless industries, including: It sure is — there’s a shortage of qualified psychologists in every state and territory in Australia, with some clients waiting up to six months for an appointment. As of 2022, 1 in 3 psychologists are so busy they’re no longer taking on new clients — in short, psychologists are in high demand! Before you can start practising as a psychologist, you’ll need to meet the requirements for registration, which means you’ll need to complete further study after you finish your UTS degree. Once you’re registered, however, the answer is yes, you can absolutely open your own practice, although you might like to get a bit of professional experience under your belt first. Once you’re ready to set up shop, you might choose to work as a solo practitioner or as part of a group practice where you partner with other psychologists, counsellors and other health professionals. Psychologists are highly qualified professionals — and their salaries reflect their expertise: the average annual salary sits between $90,000 and $105,000. Psychology careers also come with a pretty high job satisfaction rating: on average, psychologists rank their job satisfaction at 4.2 out of 5 stars. Psychologists are advanced allied health practitioners who work with people to assess, diagnose, treat and manage a range of psychological conditions. They complete at least six years of training and deliver services in a range of therapeutic and medical settings. Through their detailed understanding of the science of human behaviour, psychologists help people from a range of life circumstances to improve their mental health and wellbeing. More than 60% of psychologists in Australia have general registration. They work with people to assess, diagnose and treat a wide range of conditions and concerns. As the name suggests, they’re generalists — they don’t have a specific area of focus, which means they can apply their skills in a diversity of settings. The remaining 40% of psychologists are specialists who work in one of nine areas of practice endorsement: Read more about areas of practice endorsement Psychologists and counsellors are both allied health professionals, but they hold different qualifications and deliver different services and treatments. Psychologists complete at least six years of training. They specialise in the assessment and diagnosis of mental health conditions, and they formulate treatment plans that are based on evidence-based techniques like cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Psychology is a highly regulated profession — all psychologists must be registered nationally with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) via the Psychology Board of Australia (PBS). By contrast, counsellors use a person-centred approach to help clients solve challenges. This involves asking questions, listening in a non-judgemental manner, and helping to identify options and strategies that can help them move forward. Counsellors must complete a Diploma of Counselling at a minimum to become qualified, although many go on to further study. All psychologists must be registered nationally with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) via the Psychology Board of Australia (PBS) before they can practise in Australia. There are two pathways to AHPRA/PBS registration. Both involve completion of degrees that have been accredited by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC). To become a psychologist with general registration, you’ll need to complete at least six years of study: Step Requirement Equips you with Step 1 A 3-year APAC-accredited undergraduate degree or bridging program.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/genetic-counselling-courses/genetic-counselling-student-profiles/parker-truong,"Tell us about yourself! I’m an Australian-born Vietnamese. My parents came to Australia by boat in the 1970s. I was born in Perth, grew up in Brisbane, and settled in Melbourne a few years ago. I love Melbourne and everything it has to offer when it comes to food, sports, and cultural events and it’s why I’ve decided to stay and build my career as a Genetic Counsellor! For the past 9 years, I’d been working full-time across a range of industries before going back to study at UTS. My first job was an analyst role where I measured and reported on performance of military helicopters for the Australian Army and Navy. I moved on to do work for Victoria Police, working on projects that focused on gendered violence and preventing crime in the community. Most recently, I was a manager at the Victorian Electoral Commission, delivering on the performance needs of election officials to carry out elections. What are you passionate about? This one’s easy - my fur baby, Willis. He’s a French Bulldog and I could write a book about him. He’s goofy, affectionate, loyal and loves to bark at other dogs on the TV. I also enjoy powerlifting, Olympic lifting and metabolic conditioning and I try to incorporate this into my lifestyle. Work-life balance is really important to me – I’m not one to stay at home and I like to explore new cultures, the outdoors and go travelling. I once trekked through the jungles and caves of Vietnam, and travelled to the United States to witness the 2016 Presidential Election – what a time! What inspired you to study this degree? Having recently turned 30, I found myself reflecting on my career to date and where I see myself in the future. I realised I had reached a critical juncture in my career and wanted work that motivates me - working with people and supporting them to navigate complexities, solve problems, find solutions and use evidence-based decision making. But more so, I wanted to do these things in ways that have positive impacts on the lives of others. I have always found genetics fascinating, including during my honour’s degree in biotechnology, but couldn’t see myself working in a laboratory full-time. So, for a period of time, my interest in genetics was put aside, until now. I also knew I could draw on my own lived experiences as a child of refugees and being part of the LGBTQI+ community, to support others. Why did you choose to study at UTS? I found out that the genetic counselling program is delivered as a blended learning program combining interactive online learning, and attending campus twice a year in two blocks. This was perfect for me as it allows me to undertake the course from my hometown here in Melbourne while also immersing myself in face-to-face intensives. There can sometimes be lots of barriers to mature-age study and this removed those for me. This gave me confidence that a lot of thought has gone into the course to ensure the online learning experience is meaningful and worthwhile for students. What also attracted me to UTS was the fact that the university organises your clinical placements based on your preferences. I recently did my first placement at a local hospital here in Melbourne, and will soon do my next placement in Brisbane. I plan to do a placement in Canada next year and it’s embedded in me that this was the right choice all along! What are you learning about? A lot! How about I give you a glimpse of what I’ve been learning over the past week. In one subject, I learnt how to read and interpret a breast cancer pathology report, then practiced summarising the report for both a client and a medical expert. In another subject, I began my journey in cross cultural counselling where I’m learning to develop practice in relation to culturally safe genetic counselling care. I’ve also been working on a few assignments. In one assignment, I’m reflecting on my clinical placement at a local hospital where I had the opportunity to shadow a Genetic Counsellor and observe their work, and in another assignment, I’m critically appraising a research paper and considering the application of the findings to genetic counselling practice. And that was just last week! What is the most rewarding aspect of the course? What I find most rewarding is seeing my progression and improvement each week in becoming a trained Genetic Counsellor. We practice our communication and counselling skills very often. I’m excited to see where I will be at the end of this program – I can feel it’s already changing my perspective, behaviour and the way I navigate situations in everyday life - that’s a good thing. What I also find rewarding is seeing the work Genetic Counsellors do during my clinical placements – they play such an important and impactful role in the lives of individuals and families and I’m grateful to learn and see it first-hand. How do you balance postgraduate study alongside your other commitments? At the moment, I’m working three days per week, while attending classes on Thursdays and Fridays. It’s a great schedule because it allows me to balance work, study, exercise, and my social life. To stay on top of my assessments, I have developed a workplan that maps out when these are due and ensure I give myself enough time to complete my assignments and quizzes. It’s quite easy to balance if you plan everything out! How has the online mode of learning affected your study experience? I was hesitant about online learning previously because I didn’t like the idea of logging in to look at slides and listening to a lecturer read off these slides. I can say that this isn’t case for the Master of Genetic Counselling program. Learning involves completing your readings and activities via a learning management system prior to class, and then discussing and practicing your learnings during class. It’s very interactive and a lot of individual participation is involved. I’m now an expert at unmuting on Zoom before I speak. I don’t think I can go back to classroom learning! What do you hope to achieve in the future? I’d like to inspire more people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds into the genetic counselling field. I believe the profession should be reflective of the clients we see – this builds courage and confidence in the very people who have decisions to navigate in relation to their health, and I know it’s helped me personally in the past. In terms of career goals, I simply want to be a Genetic Counsellor who makes a positive impact in the life of others, and be surrounded by colleagues who want the same. What advice do you have for students who are considering this course? Talk to a Genetic Counsellor to gain a good understanding of the work that they do and make sure this is a commitment you are ready for. Be genuine and authentic in your personal statement – this really stands out to the reader, and for yourself, be clear about your ‘why’. Don’t forget to talk about how your professional, volunteering, study, and lived experience is relevant to the genetic counselling profession. Reach out to academic staff if you need suggestions on how to upskill your human genetics knowledge. Good luck!

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/speech-pathology-courses/why-be-speech-pathologist,"Dr Catherine Gregory: When people think of speech pathologists, they often think of us working with children in helping children speak. But speech pathologist's can help people in a lot of different ways. Dr Lucy Bryant: A speech pathologist accesses, diagnoses, treats and managers a range of communication and swallowing disorders. So things like speech, language, literacy, fluency, voice and social communication. Helen Blake: And because we also learn about all the anatomy and physiology you need to speak, we know about any difficulties you might have with swallowing and feeding, so we can help with that too. Dr Amy Freeman: It's such a diverse profession. We work right through the age spectrum. So from infancy right to old age. Associate Professor Emma Power: Speech pathologists work with individuals, but we also want to change systems. So, can we make systems accessible for people with communication and swallowing disorders. Professor Bronwyn Hemsley: Here at UTS in Speech Pathology, we're looking to prepare practice-ready graduates so they're ready to go out and perhaps work in a private practice or eventually run their own private practice. Dr Lucy Bryant: We have specialized learning classrooms that offer our students the chance to work in small groups to apply the skills that they learn, rather than just being lectured and obtaining loads of knowledge, so that students can actually apply their skills in the types of settings that they would see in clinic rooms. Professor Bronwyn Hemsley: The other thing we're doing is helping them to work with other professionals, inter professional practice. The job prospects for our graduates are extremely good and growing. Dr Amy Freeman: Speech pathologists work in hospitals, health care settings, community health, schools, mental health, private practice. It's just so broad, it's a really diverse range of settings. Professor Bronwyn Hemsley: And we're really focused on the future of Speech Pathology, so areas such as virtual reality, augmented reality, gaming technologies, the smart home devices and 3D printing of food are all areas that Speech Pathology might be going into. Harmony Turnbull: I chose to be a speech pathologist because I really like the mix of science together with really connecting with people and making a different in people's lives. Dr Lucy Bryant: I chose to be a speech pathologist because I believe that every human needs to have the ability to communicate. Dr Amy Freeman: I knew I wanted to work with people and I loved science and I loved teaching. Associate Professor Emma Power: I really loved communication. I love science. I like connecting the two because we're in a profession that involves interpersonal skills where we have to deliver the science through the medium of communication. Helen Blake: I also love the fact that I'm actually helping people to be able to participate fully in whatever opportunities they want to have across their life. Info session Course guide (PDF) Enquire now To communicate freely with others, to be listened to and understood; these are communication rights for everyone. But some people miss out. There are many reasons to study Speech Pathology, but this is the most powerful: you will forever be in demand to support the 1.2 million Australians with a communication disability. As well as that, you’ll also have a role in enabling people who have difficulty eating, drinking, or swallowing to have safe and enjoyable meals. If you need to more reasons to be convinced, here are just a few to help tip the balance: Do you like working with people? Speech pathologists engage with people from many cultural backgrounds and clients of all ages – from infants and their parents, to adults and their family members and supporters. In many settings, you’ll work in a vibrant interprofessional team of health professionals all focused on creating the best outcomes in partnership with the client. With a wide range of skills, you’ll find a variety of workplace options to consider once you graduate. Speech pathologists work in hospitals, nursing homes, local health clinics, schools, private practice, rehabilitation centres and corporations – and can work anywhere using telehealth online. Better yet, you’ll find it easy to switch career direction at any time – your skills, person-centred values, and leadership qualities will see you contribute meaningfully wherever you choose. Satisfy your inner entrepreneur by setting up your own private practice. At UTS you’ll not only learn the skills needed to become a successful speech pathologist, but we’ll show you how to choose a great practice at the start of your career and create your business plan too. You will graduate with the skills and experience to work in any setting with many clients, but if you have a passion to work mainly with children or with adults, or want to work with both, you can. People need speech pathology services at many different stages over their lives, and your own talents and preferences can help to guide your continual professional development. Love social media and digital technologies? So do speech pathologists who are embracing modern innovations such as telehealth, mobile devices, social media and assistive technologies to help people everywhere to access services, and to get their message across. Speech pathology is an evolving profession and you’ll find opportunities to broaden your experiences and learn new things constantly. The National Disability Insurance Scheme being established, the ageing population, and increased focus on inclusive education in schools, have created an increasing demand for speech pathologists across Australia. At UTS, we’re adopting Speech Pathology Australia’s ambitious vision for the profession. We need speech pathologists with an eye on the future and a strong desire to transform evidence into practice, enabling many more people and addressing the current large gaps in service provision. Being ready and able to collaborate and connect across cultures will really help to move new advancements in technology into clinical practice. Lastly, a list of why study speech pathology would not be complete without mentioning the great feeling of achievement you get once your client builds new communication skills or has their first enjoyable meal without coughing and choking. There’s a real sense of satisfaction in knowing that you’ve enabled progress and are changing people’s lives for the better, forever.

That the problems that we have in our society, in every society in the world and globally, are so big and so complex that they can't be answered by any one discipline.

It feels like i am genuinely working on real projects with the friends that i have made here, and there's just a lot of support from the Lecturers.

During the process, students become lifelong innovators, entrepreneurs, creative practitioners and changemakers. See how the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation (BCII) is education re-imagined for the future. It really is a degree like no other – there is nothing predictable or ordinary about the way that learning and assessments take place. UTS: Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation A degree like no other. (Instrumental Music Plays) Cutaway to students working in groups, presenting to peers and academics in an open lecture theatre. Dominica Ingui (BA Communications (Public Communication), B Creative Intelligence and Innovation) ""I decided on Creative Intelligence because I thought it was something really new, and interesting about Uni. I wasn't looking for anything traditional out of my degree, i was looking for something... for something unique and something to set me apart from the rest of the graduates."" Cutaway to students doing group work, sitting around tables with large flat-screen monitors and working in collaborative classrooms. One male student giving a presentation. Tommaso Armstrong (B Engineering (Hons), B Creative Intelligence and Innovation) ""The difference with the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation is that it allows you, sort of to more play with ideas and its a lot more fluid. They haven't taught us any facts, they've taught us ways to look at problems and then set us up with things to go and look at and research."" Cutaway to students in discussion in collaborative workspace. One student taking notes on a laptop computer. Professor Anne Cranny-Francis Professor, Cultural Studies Program""In designing this course, we are coming from the viewpoint that many people have arrived at these days... That the problems that we have in our society, in every society in the world and globally, are so big and so complex that they can't be answered by any one discipline. That what we need are teams of people bringing the knowledges and skills that they have from each of their own disciplines together, to solve these major problems."" Cutaway to students attending a workshop, being briefed in creative agency ""The Hallway"" Dr Julia Prior Senior Lecturer, School of Software ""So the course was designed by people from across seven different faculties and the students that can do the course at present, are from eighteen core degrees across the seven faculties."" Cutaway to student cohort on site in ""The Hallway"" creative agency, being briefed for a project. Annabel Vici - (B Science, B Creative Intelligence and Innovation) ""One of the things that they really stress is the importance of collaborating with people from other disciplines, and they call it a transdisciplinary degree because they educate us in the methods, and ways of thinking of the other disciplines. It really opens up possiblities for solutions."" Cutaway to student field trip inside ABC recording studios. Dominica Ingui: ""Creative Intelligence doesn't really feel like Uni... It feels like i am genuinely working on real projects with the friends that i have made here, and there's just a lot of support from the Lecturers. They don't feel like superiors to you, everyone is on an equal grounding here, everyone's voices are heard and all of the possibilities that we come up with as young people, all of those possibilities are exhausted."" Cutaway to students working with an academic, students at tables deconstructing small electronic devices with screwdrivers to investigate the way that they function inside. Students making presentations with presentation slides displayed on large screens in lecture theatre setting. Michael Northey (B Design in Architecture, B Creative Intelligence and Innovation) ""The BCII is real world problems, and real world possibilities and i think that working with clients such as ABC and Google which we are currently doing in our summer school - really enables students to have that kind of perspective on what its like to work in real life. Cutaway to set of ABC KIDS TV show ""Giggle and Hoot"" with BCII students observing filming of the show. Students in lecture theatre giving presentations for workshop with Google. Cutaway to diagrams made with post-it-notes and students collaborating with a representative from Google as facilitator. Some students speaking into microphone as part of class discussion. Michael Northey: "" I think a student who would really benefit from BCII, is one who wants to be extended in their learning opportunities and really go outside of the traditional kind of classroom structure that you get."" Eleanor Crumpton (B Design in Integrated Product Design, B Creative Intelligence and Innovation) ""I would definitely recommend BCII to people who are looking for more than just the standard degree, who are really looking for things to add to the real world, (and take sic.) people who are ambitious, people who want to network and really make the most of their lives."" Tommaso Armstrong: ""I can already tell its going to be invaluable experience to me and its going to allow me to look at the world differently, and give me a unique perspective on things.""

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/transdisciplinary-innovation/undergraduate-courses/td-electives-program,"Be Transdisciplinary. Your degree at UTS will open up a world of professional opportunities, but what about the possibilities to learn outside, beyond and across your degree? This is where the Transdisciplinary Electives Program at UTS comes in. UTS has pioneered a unique, multi-award-winning approach to transdisciplinary learning, filled with purpose and passion. Learn how to collaborate with others to tackle the complex problems of our time. Learn methods drawing on your own and others’ knowledge to expand your core degree and yourself. And importantly, make friends for life from across the university, well beyond your faculty. You've gone into university to pursue a degree with the view that you'll leave that degree and practice that, but actually being able to critically reflect on what it is you're doing, how you might be able to learn from other approaches, recognising that actually there is no one right way, there are multiple ways that we can approach a problem is a really constructive and useful thing to do. What the TD subject gave to me was an appreciation for other methods of learning and other cultural and personal approaches to learning and thinking that you just don't get by writing numbers down on a page. The perspective that TD has given me has enabled me to approach my other subjects in a new way. How is this impacting the world or from what angle or what approach can I perceive this in a practical way. The fact that students are able to leave or do an elective leaving with a portfolio demonstration that they've actually done practical work and thought about and engaged with the problem and walked away with some potential solutions or intervention for how they might shift that space shows potential employers that they've got some flexibility that they are generalists as well as specialists. Being able to push and extend and be a leader in that space because they recognise that there's other ways of operating in the world. In all my other electives I haven't had access to third parties other than UTS academics or fellow students and so working with an additional partner on top of that was incredibly unique and an opportunity that I believe you know I can put that on my resume and say I have experience with stakeholder management. I have you know these really valuable experiences and considerations which is a skill in and of itself. My skills in terms of community focus have strengthened. I've put myself out there way more and taken up different opportunities within my own community and then also sought out other opportunities. Transdisciplinary electives are your opportunity to differentiate yourself, which is why the university is embedding eight of them in every undergraduate degree between 2022–2025. All you have to do is choose which one inspires you the most. In each TD elective subject, you’ll work on a real-world challenge presented by an industry partner organisation. Exercise your knowledge as an emerging professional, put your ideas to the test and learn alongside some of the great minds of industry who are working on some of the most wicked problems of our time. From 2023, students will undertake a transdisciplinary elective as a required component of their UTS undergraduate degree.* * With the exception of students concurrently enrolled in the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation. You can take the following transdisciplinary elective subjects at 6- or 8-credit points. Unleash your creative thinking to develop novel responses to a real-world challenge posed by the Australian Red Cross. Collaborate with fellow students in multidisciplinary teams to scrutinise assumptions, probe the unknowns and test your professional capabilities by devising new approaches to tackling climate change and building community resilience. Ask ‘big questions’ about the future, supported by insights from developments in diverse disciplinary and professional fields and become a critical and empathetic futures-thinker. Work in multidisciplinary teams on a real-world challenge from the City of Sydney and use futuring methods to identify transformative paths to more sustainable and ethical, regenerative futures. Keen to tackle some of our most complex social and environmental challenges? Learn how to think differently about the ‘wicked’ problems we face in our networked world by experimenting with regenerative principles in real-world contexts. Working with an industry partner, Regen Studios, develop your professional, analytic, and creative skills and build sustainable networks relevant to you today and in the future. Learn to understand and lead change in response to emergent complex problems that call for a transdisciplinary approach. Work in multidisciplinary teams on a live industry partner brief from Stockland and be challenged to deal with rapid response timeframes, dynamic conditions and resource constraints, amongst other complexities. This subject provides a creative, safe space for collaboration, thinking differently and experimentation to develop strategies for taking proactive steps when facing the unknowns for the rest of your professional life. Enrol via My Student Admin Pick the format that best suits your study plan. To see the full range of options, refer to My Timetable Planner for details. You can take a transdisciplinary elective subject as part of your undergraduate degree if you have available elective subjects. The Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation is not compatible with these subjects. For the Diploma in Innovation at TD School, one of these subjects can be counted towards the diploma in lieu of 81539 via Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). In such cases, students are required to choose another elective towards their core degree. If you have questions about enrolling in a transdisciplinary elective subject within your course program, speak with UTS Student Centre. If your course structure contains multiple free electives, you can enrol in more than one TD subject as part of your degree. If you’re not sure, check in with UTS Student Centre.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/design-architecture-and-building/about-design-architecture-and-building/featured-courses/bachelor-design-visual-communication/visual-communication-student-work,"Visual communication students work across a broad range of media and sectors, developing innovative solutions that combine high levels of craft refinement with strategic thinking and social change agendas. Michelle Chan and Rachel Holt. Winner Yellow Pencil, D&AD Awards Visual Communication students Madi Chan and Rachel Holt won a prestigious D&AD Gold Pencil for Blackout, their awareness campaign and speculative mobile app that visualises the unseen and alarmingly large carbon footprint of our online activity. The project was the result of an intense six week research and design process that involved surveys, literature reviews, persona development and customer journey mapping, to dig down into this complex issue and identify barriers to young people acting on climate change. Young Australians are watching their country burn.1 billion animals are dead. 250 million tons of Co2 produced. We feel totally powerless. As we hopelessly watch, scroll and share videos of the bushfires, we think ""I'm just one person, what difference can I possibly make?"" What we don't realise is that the problem is in our hands. For every 1GB of data used, 27KG of Co2 is put into our atmosphere. That's more than a flight from Sydney to Melbourne. So what do we do? We propose ... a blackout. Connect 4 Climate's carbon neutral app changes the settings of your phone to produce as few carbon emissions as possible. By tracking your data usage you can create a sustainable digital lifestyle. Once you're set up, you don't have to do a thing. We'll switch your default video preferences from high definition to standard definition to save 20kg of Co2. We'll let you know which apps have a poor Co2 rating, and provide you with better alternatives. To help you stick to your new habits, you can even set a daily data allowance and once you've reached the limit, we'll blackout your phone. Blackout will send you one notification a day to show you how much data you've saved. We donate this data to Australians in need. Our partners will greyscale their logos and #blackout on social. We're showing young Australians the real impact of using their phones. We've teamed up with Google Maps to track how your little changes are making a big impact. Blackout will alter everyday user behaviour without you having to do anything differently. You can make your actions count, with Blackout. Madeleine Garratt, Hayley Kim, Marc Pizzinato, April Tran, Daisy Yang In this project, students rebranded Soulgen, a social-enterprise consultancy which collaborates with councils, organisations, young people and diverse communities to grow their confidence and work better together. To drive the rebrand, and updating of digital touchpoints, students applied various design methods including ABCD (Asset Based Community Development), co-design, storytelling and creative arts. Emily De Freitas. Awarded Merit, ISTD (International Society of Type Designers) Uncovering Migration Memories is a publication exploring experiences of migration, documenting the often dangerous and emotionally arduous journeys undertaken by migrants. Memory provides an unreliable record of our lives, often fading and distorting over time. Uncovering Migration Memories uses typography to suggest this instability, leaving the viewer to physically uncover and reconstruct each individual story. Hayley Cumming. Awarded Merit, AGDA Student Awards We live in an algorithmic culture. Computation is everywhere. Algorithms curate our social media feeds and determine our search results. They are all around us, yet remain inscrutable: packaged behind slick, user-friendly interfaces. ‘Uncanny Algorithms’ is a design research workshop that seeks to reveal the hidden algorithms that surround us by translating them into tangible objects and activities. Participants work in pairs; one plays the role of the ‘computer’, while the other plays the part of the ‘human’, The relationship that unfolds between them acts as a metaphor to challenge the uncanny ways computers understand us, and encourages designers to seek moments of intervention when creating the systems that surround algorithms. Annabel Cook, Lina Lindberg, Samson Ossedryver. Winner Gold Pencil, D&AD Awards Tasked with rebranding the Crown Plaza hotel chain to appeal to younger generation of business travellers, the UTS team came up with a campaign to combine business with pleasure.Up to no good or down to business — what will you get up to at Crowne Plaza? Young, urban business professionals are defined by their dualistic desires and demands. They are a generation who yearns for the serenity of the woods but with high speed WiFi in the cabin. The Crowne Plaza rebrand targets this generation through a dualistic brand identity and experience where guests are encouraged to indulge in both business and pleasure in the one trip because, why have it one way when you can have it all? Hello young urban business professionals. The nature of business is changing and the nature of travel is changing. You want flexible, individual, authentic experiences. You want it all. You want WiFi in the woods. You greedy bastards. We may have been late to the party, but we've got the best costume, and we brought a cake. Introducing Crowne Plaza. Down to business. Up to no good. You want to party and sleep. Get crazy in the bedroom and then seal the deal in the boardroom. Skull a vodka, but then down it with a San Pellegrino. And eat fries while you're on the treadmill. So will you be getting down to business or up to no good when you stay at Crowne Plaza? Our 5 Crowne Plaza emojis suggest what your trip will be like based on your customised choices. For this guest, its somewhere in between. Tickets to a rave on a business trip? You're definitely flirting with danger. We offer a self check-in service, because, we don't like talking to people either. While you're at it, you can check out what other guests are up to. And then head straight up to your room. Swipe swipe. In your room every object has two sides, allowing for no fuss indulgence whenever you please. No matter which space you're in, we'll be encouraging you to work hard, play harder. And at the end of your stay, you'll be getting two invoices. One for your boss ""Oh yes... very professional"", and one for you ""Oooh, 22 beers, hey?"". Its our little secret. Crowne Plaza. Down to business. Up to no good.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/transdisciplinary-innovation/undergraduate-courses/diploma-innovation/diploma-innovation-faqs,"These FAQs are aimed at current UTS students. Note: Future UTS students (i.e. high school leavers), see also Diploma in Innovation course page. Points of distinction include: While ‘diploma’ normally implies a degree that sits somewhere between high school and a bachelors degree, this one is designed to be done concurrently to a bachelors degree, including double degrees. In this context ‘diploma’ only means that it’s a 48cp degree program (half the credit point of a bachelor degree). It’s a premium experience but contained to 48cp so you can finish it alongside a bachelor degree (single or combined). This course enables students to gain exposure to real-world problems and collaborate with a diverse group of students, academics and industry partners, consolidating the course aims in their chosen area of study while developing the creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial capabilities that are highly sought across all sectors. As the name suggests, the Diploma in Innovation has a strong emphasis on innovation. This means you get to learn the processes and methods by which ideas are generated, vetted, tested, iterated on, brought to market, adapted to local contexts, and more. These frameworks and capabilities are eye-opening for graduates entering the professional and commercial world beyond their core degree. The Diploma is available to any undergraduate student at UTS with only one exception: you cannot simultaneously be enrolled in Diploma and the BCII. Apply direct to UTS through My Student Portal. Not through UAC. You can apply simultaneously to applying to UTS. If you are accepted to UTS, we’ll then automatically process your application for the Diploma. Most students apply immediately after they have started their core degree. Students can apply for the Diploma prior to the July or December sessions. It is recommended to enrol during your first year to graduate simultaneously to your core degree. You can still enrol later into the Diploma and recombine the subjects in a more intensive way for an accelerated completion, and still meet your core degree’s graduation date. You cannot study the Diploma by itself (with no core degree), after graduation, or enrol during the final session of your core degree. No, it cannot be taken full-time. Subjects only run in July, December and February sessions, to enable their integration with your core degree. Yes. This is a frequent question for 2nd-year students. There are ways to timetable the subjects to complete the course in less than three years. This is because subjects run across three sessions (July, December and February) and because of how you can double-up Monday & Thursday intensive subjects with Tuesday & Friday ones. You can enrol in Diploma subjects as electives first, and then upgrade to the Diploma in Innovation. You're able to enrol in just about any of the Diploma subjects as an elective in your core degree(s). If you like what you see and want to commit to more, then apply for the Diploma and: a. receive cross credit for the subject(s) you have completed (up to 24 cpt). You do not need to find another elective for your core degree(s) and you finish early; or, b. submit an eRequest to count the credit points to the Diploma. You’ll then need to find another elective for your core degree(s). Starting 2022, TD School is offering new transdisciplinary general electives to undergraduate students through the TD Electives Program. You can start by studying a TD elective and then enrol in the Diploma and submit an eRequest to count the elective subject as credit towards the Diploma (in place of 81539). Then you’ll have to find another elective for your core degree. Ready to roll? Or, want to pack the Diploma into two years? No problem. We recommend starting the Diploma in Innovation at TD School in your first year. But, we recognise some students only find out about it in their second year. You can start it in your second year and still finished in your third year. Or, you can graduate from your core degree and return for a 3-week intensive to finish up the Diploma. Joint with UTS Startups The Diploma in Innovation is perfectly suited to simultaneously registering for support from UTS Startups. The wonderful and sometimes whacky world of startups is best explored in a safe-to-fail environment like university. By the time you graduate, you might be onto your third or fourth startup, dramatically increasing the chances of success with each one. And, UTS students get steeply discounted access to the ProtoSpace, Australia’s most advanced additive manufacturing facility, right under Alumni Green. Other options A popular choice with students in the Bachelor of Business or Bachelor of Management is the Digital Creative Enterprise submajor, which draws on a 24cp mix of subjects from the Diploma. The Diploma in Innovation is also the perfect segue into the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence. Your choice, really! We generally recommend starting with either 81539 in the Creative Intelligence stream or 94663 in the Innovation and Entrepreneurship stream. In the Innovation & Entrepreneurship stream, 94662 Fundamental of Innovation must be taken before 94658 Innovation Funding Platforms. They can be taken in any sequence. However, the subjects build on each other best in the sequence of 94663, 94662, and then 94658. The Diploma in Innovation can be a pathway into the BCII. Eligibility criteria include: Applications are lodged internally to TD School. Here's more information about internal course transfers (ICTs) at TD School. Students already in the BCII who don’t complete the fourth year will be able to graduate with the Diploma in Innovation via the internal course transfer (graduating) process. Applications are lodged internally to TD School. Here's more information about internal course transfers (ICTs) at TD School. The BCII is the 96cp component of a combined (double) degree that the vast majority of students enter via UAC. Students enter as a cohort, complete the first 3 years of BCII during the winter and summer breaks and continue with a BCII-focussed 4th-year. In comparison, to the BCII: Make an enquiry Based on your enquiry we then may put you in touch with the TD School academic programs officer or Diploma course director.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/law/courses/undergraduate-law/course-experience/undergraduate-profiles/adelle-elhosni,"What led you to choose UTS:Law for your studies? I chose UTS:Law because I knew I would gain a tertiary educational experience at a reputable and well-established institution. From my research into different law schools, I was quick to realise that UTS:Law would provide me with a practical and contemporary legal education, all within a supportive learning environment. The university was welcoming and the students I had the chance to meet prior to my selection of UTS, were equally as welcoming and spoke very highly of the supportive culture within the faculty. Now in my fifth year, I can attest to this supportive and friendly culture. If you are working while you are studying, what does your job involve? I am currently working as a paralegal at a top-tier commercial law firm. In this role I engage in a range of tasks that involve assisting junior and senior lawyers, to partners. Tasks I often engage in include the preparation of documents for court proceedings, the compilation of briefs for counsel, developing research memos on particular points of law or on recent legal developments, and assisting in drafting advises to clients. I am also employed by UTS as a U:PASS leader. U:PASS stands for UTS Peer Assisted Study Success, and in my role as a leader I facilitate weekly group study sessions for first year business students in a subject called Business Statistics. This role allows me to give back to the university by assisting students with their studies in a difficult subject, as well as encouraging cooperative learning in a comfortable environment. There are also UTS U:PASS leaders who lead in select law subjects including Criminal Law and Real Property Law. How do you balance study and work commitments? It is important to strike a healthy balance between study and work commitments as well as leisurely activities. I have been able to do this by managing my time, and prioritising my tasks during semester. As a law student, I quickly learnt the importance of applying myself consistently to my studies, and I benefited from being able to set myself weekly goals to complete my university work each semester. It was certainly beneficial to have part-time work, as I noticed that throughout my university studies, I was able to learn the importance of time management as a result of having other work commitments. It is also important to remind yourself that there is always time for work, but that there must always be time to spend with family and friends. Working out a suitable approach to study for each subject at the beginning of each semester is how I have been able to achieve a balance between my personal and professional commitments. How have/will your studies at UTS contributed to your career? How have they informed the way you work? My studies at UTS have contributed to my professional development in a number of ways. I have been able to enhance my written communication skills through various assessment tasks including academic essay writing and problem solving exercises. In addition to gaining an invaluable insight into the law across a range of subject areas, the opportunity to apply the law in practice has presented itself across most law courses, as we have been assessed on our application of the law to practical scenarios. This has been a beneficial way to transition from learning the law in theory and applying the law in practice. Engaging in in-class discussions has also allowed me to develop inter-personal and oral communication skills, and I have come to appreciate the importance of succinct and well-considered answers. In addition, the faculties ongoing support of the UTS Law Society and the opportunity to engage in competitions such as client interviewing and mooting, has allowed me to develop a range of professional skills, and appreciate the importance of cooperative teamwork. Finally, the opportunity to be lectured and mentored by academics, many of whom have and continue to engage in different professions in law, has allowed me to gain an insight into where my degree might take me. It is exciting to know that a law degree can pave the way for your future career development in any direction you choose! What is the most rewarding aspect of your degree? Why? The most rewarding aspect of my degree has been the opportunity to learn about different areas of law and complex legal concepts. As I began my degree at UTS I quickly came to the realisation that a law degree and practice in the legal field involves a life-long learning process. I have found enjoyment in learning about the law, and knowing that I will one day use my knowledge for the benefit of others, will be a rewarding experience that I look forward to as I enter the workforce. In addition to the learning experience, the people that I have met throughout my degree have presented another rewarding aspect of my studies. The friendships that I have developed with my peers are friendships that I know will last a lifetime, as well as the academics that I have come to learn so much from and been inspired by, have all contributed to an amazing learning experience. What would your advice be for someone who is looking at studying Law at UTS? Do your research about the degree to see if law is something that might interest you. Try and talk to students currently studying at UTS and pay the faculty a visit so you can see for yourself just how friendly and supportive the culture at UTS really is. Apart from that, don’t question whether you have the ability to engage in a law degree. Go for it, and know that UTS is an institution where you will have the support you need to succeed. If you have come this far and feel that a law degree is something you are interested in, then embrace what will be a challenging yet greatly rewarding experience. Is there anything else you’d like to add about your experience at UTS:Law, or the University as a whole? I have enjoyed every moment of my time at UTS – it is important to find a place where you fit, and I found this at UTS. My studies at UTS:Law have been both challenging and insightful, and I would encourage others who decide to take the journey of a law degree, to do so at UTS:Law.

Some say ‘no’, but we say, ’yes, of course!’. Entrepreneurship, like any other professional field, can be learned through practice. The tools, methods and mindset of entrepreneurship can be studied, especially if taught in an experiential way. This is why every student in the Executive MBA in Entrepreneurship works on a project from ideation to launch. Since the program was launched in 2016 (in its first format), about 130 students have taken subjects or graduated from the program. While every student launches a startup or social venture by the end of the program, about 10 per cent are still working on that project a year later. Many graduates have moved on to other projects, joined another startup or taken roles in larger organisations. Yes, the Executive MBA in Entrepreneurship is specifically designed so that you can work on your own ideas. Over the course, you have many opportunities to also work on startup ideas of your fellow students or other startups and scale-ups associated with the degree. Yes, although you should at least have an area of interest or problem space to work with. Most subjects in the Executive MBA in Entrepreneurship will require that you apply the learning to your own project. We understand that your ideas change as you progress through the program. This is a normal part of the entrepreneurial journey. Your ideas will transform as you learn more about the problem you are trying to solve and understand more about entrepreneurship.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/law/courses/undergraduate-law/course-experience/undergraduate-profiles/harry-power,"Are you working while studying? Yes. For the past year and a half, I've been working as a part-time Law Clerk in a law firm in the City. Before that, I was involved as a U:PASS tutor here at UTS and working in the hospitality industry. What does your job involve? Is it related to your degree? The job involves doing a lot of legal research, drafting letters to clients, preparing briefs for Counsel, doing discovery of documents and reviewing evidence for trial etc. So yes, it is definitely related to my degree: seeing how what I’ve learnt in Law School plays out in the real world. How do you manage the competing demands of university and work? Yeah, it certainly can be a challenge at times. Having to juggle full-time study and part-time work definitely doesn't leave a lot of spare time, especially if you've got extra-curricular or family commitments on the side. Really, it comes down to being organised and managing your time effectively. Fortunately, UTS really encourages that form the get-go and allows for a flexible approach to study that I haven't really seen in other institutions. By this I mean they offer night-classes, allow you to take subjects in block-mode, and generally has a pretty good online course content delivery. The uni also has a number of programs which help new students adjust to university life; such as U:PASS, a fantastic initiative which sees older students who have already passed a subject returning to run supplementary sessions for new students to help them understand the content. I went to every U:PASS session that I could when I was in my first two years and I attribute a lot of my success to it. What led you to choose UTS:Law for your studies? UTS was the only university that offered the degree I wanted to do. As a wide-eyed high school leaver, the chance to combine two very interesting areas, medical science and law, made UTS a pretty compelling choice. What is the most rewarding aspect of your degree? Why? The people I’ve met and the lessons I’ve learned. From my own experience, generally all of the students that attend UTS are an easy-going, down-to-earth, bright bunch which makes it a real joy coming to campus every day. I’ve met some of my best friends here at UTS, and that's something I’ll always be thankful for. Furthermore, what I really enjoyed about UTS was that many of the lecturers tried to go beyond focussing on what the law simply is; but rather, what the law should be and the various challenges we’re facing in getting there. That kind of 'bigger picture' perspective I’ve been incredibly grateful for. In many cases, the lecturers strove to go beyond your classic lecture-theatre environment, delivering the content in a more thought-provoking way. For instance, in my Refugee Law and Practice course, rather than simply getting to know the legislation and case law (read: the approach taken in nearly all other subjects), we were tasked with stepping into the shoes of a stakeholder involved in a refugee detained upon Manus Island and developing an advocacy strategy for achieving our stakeholder’s respective goals. It was a fresh take on the content that made me identify my stakeholder’s limitations, forcing me to think globally about a real world problem. This kind of experience was invaluable, and for me, indicative of UTS’ deeper determination to teach their courses in a more dynamic and practical way. Where would you like your double degree to take your career? I'm still weighing up my options, but at this point I'd love to go into an area of the law that draws upon both my legal and medical science knowledge. Are you involved in extra-curricular activities such as the Mentoring program, Brennan program, Mooting, LSS? How has this experience aided your career/personal development? Yes, throughout my degree I've been involved in several of the extra-curricular activities offered here at UTS. In my first year, I attended the UTS LSS First Year Peer Mentoring program which proved a really valuable experience in getting to learn some of the basic legal concepts and skills from older students. In my third year, I was the mentor helping out the newbies, a kind of circularity characteristic of UTS that comes with being really happy and willing to give back on campus. I was also lucky enough to be involved in the Mooting program here at UTS. Mooting, for those of you who don’t know, is essentially legal debating. You take either side of a dispute and present your best arguments before a judge to try and win the case. For those who succeed, the University supports competitors at both the national and international level. I was lucky enough to represent UTS over in Oxford at the Price Media Law Moot competition which was a great experience. Finally, I’ve been involved in both the LSS (Law Student’s Society) and the United Nations Society. Both societies are pretty active on campus and, for a naive kid straight out of high school, it was welcome to meet some like-minded students who were in the same stage of life as me. What would your advice be for someone who is looking at studying Law at UTS? Give it a go, if you’re keen. There’s a lot to be had here, so take it. Take advantage of the opportunities that are available to you such as the exchange program, the BUiLD (Beyond UTS International Leadership Development) Program, the Brennan Program and many of the clubs and societies that exist on campus. It’s a good fun ride, but, you have to make the effort. Also, don’t be put off by the work load. Yes, it can be big at times, but by banding together, getting through the content isn’t so difficult. Don’t miss classes and don’t be afraid to engage with your lecturers. You’ll be surprised how helpful they are. Is there anything else you’d like to add about your experience at UTS:Law, or the University as a whole? If you’re considering law, then I would highly recommend UTS. It’s a well-respected degree without the angst or pretence of some other institutions. You’ll come out more confident, and (hopefully) you’ll have learnt a little something which puts you on a career path you’re interested in.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/speech-pathology-courses,"Dr Catherine Gregory: When people think of speech pathologists, they often think of us working with children in helping children speak. But speech pathologist's can help people in a lot of different ways. Dr Lucy Bryant: A speech pathologist accesses, diagnoses, treats and managers a range of communication and swallowing disorders. So things like speech, language, literacy, fluency, voice and social communication. Helen Blake: And because we also learn about all the anatomy and physiology you need to speak, we know about any difficulties you might have with swallowing and feeding, so we can help with that too. Dr Amy Freeman: It's such a diverse profession. We work right through the age spectrum. So from infancy right to old age. Associate Professor Emma Power: Speech pathologists work with individuals, but we also want to change systems. So, can we make systems accessible for people with communication and swallowing disorders. Professor Bronwyn Hemsley: Here at UTS in Speech Pathology, we're looking to prepare practice-ready graduates so they're ready to go out and perhaps work in a private practice or eventually run their own private practice. Dr Lucy Bryant: We have specialized learning classrooms that offer our students the chance to work in small groups to apply the skills that they learn, rather than just being lectured and obtaining loads of knowledge, so that students can actually apply their skills in the types of settings that they would see in clinic rooms. Professor Bronwyn Hemsley: The other thing we're doing is helping them to work with other professionals, inter professional practice. The job prospects for our graduates are extremely good and growing. Dr Amy Freeman: Speech pathologists work in hospitals, health care settings, community health, schools, mental health, private practice. It's just so broad, it's a really diverse range of settings. Professor Bronwyn Hemsley: And we're really focused on the future of Speech Pathology, so areas such as virtual reality, augmented reality, gaming technologies, the smart home devices and 3D printing of food are all areas that Speech Pathology might be going into. Harmony Turnbull: I chose to be a speech pathologist because I really like the mix of science together with really connecting with people and making a different in people's lives. Dr Lucy Bryant: I chose to be a speech pathologist because I believe that every human needs to have the ability to communicate. Dr Amy Freeman: I knew I wanted to work with people and I loved science and I loved teaching. Associate Professor Emma Power: I really loved communication. I love science. I like connecting the two because we're in a profession that involves interpersonal skills where we have to deliver the science through the medium of communication. Helen Blake: I also love the fact that I'm actually helping people to be able to participate fully in whatever opportunities they want to have across their life.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/law/courses/undergraduate-law/course-experience/undergraduate-profiles/jason-corbett,"What motivated you to study this degree? For me, I made a choice to study at UTS as an institution rather than a choice to study any particular degree at first. I didn't really know what I wanted to study leaving high school, but I was pushed into studying a double degree of Business and Law out of practicality by my parents. Overtime, I have come to appreciate and cherish studying Law at UTS. I have felt welcome from my first day here, and the Law faculty is very open in showing that they care about who their students develop into in their time at university. What is it like to study at UTS:Law? UTS is a wonderfully supportive study environment. UTS has a particular focus on teaching students how to engage with their materials in a practical manner, so essentially all course work is structured around teaching students to apply the law they learned to problem questions that mirror practice. There are also some assessment tasks which are performance based such as mooting and negotiation, both activities of which have facilitated my learning remarkably well by letting me engage in them as a practitioner would. But the studies, of course, come with a very vibrant social life. UTS has social clubs aplenty, and every week there is a party, meet-up, or event of some sort on. Where would you like your degree to take your career? My hope is that my degree will take me into practice as a lawyer in a commercial law firm with a global outlook and strong social justice conscience. I genuinely find commercial work (particularly transactional work) to be interesting as I am currently working in it, and this is where I see the bulk of my future heading. Time and time again we see that the law does not always protect those most vulnerable, so working for a firm with a strong pro-bono practice and significant community involvement through charity programs and the like is important to me. Are you working while studying? What does your job involve? Is it related to your degree? I currently work as a legal associate to an independent international commercial arbitrator. I find my job very interesting and engaging. It's an incredibly unique field of work which involves resolution of large-scale commercial disputes from the arbitrator's point of view. My work is closely related to that of a judge's tipstaff, only my work is more flexible and far more international, often involving disputing parties not just from different countries, but entirely different legal systems (civil law v common law). As an alternative dispute resolution procedure, my work as a legal associate to an arbitrator will commonly entail drafting tribunal communications with the parties, sifting through and researching submissions made by the parties, and contributing to my boss's business development practice. How do you manage the competing demands of university and work? A lack of sleep and an tidal wave of coffee every day. No but seriously, you just do it. All good opportunities will necessarily take time to involve yourself in, but the value of being a part of these opportunities is far too significant to pass up simply because you can't envision yourself being as busy as you'll need to be to keep everything together. Everything is important, but I prioritise the commitments according to what is due and when they're due, and work to that schedule. After all, you'll only ever be able to experience university at this stage of your life once, so you will always find a way to manage competing demands to get the most out of the experience. Have you been involved in extra-curricular activities such as the Mentoring program, Brennan program, Mooting, LSS? How has this experience aided your career/personal development? The most enjoyable and most practical extra-curricular activity I have been involved in are the variety of skills-based competitions available. In negotiation, my partner and I competed at the national level in Hobart. We were fortunate enough to win on behalf of UTS, and we have since been invited to represent Australia at the International Negotiation Competition to be held in Oslo in 2017. In mooting, I have competed nationally through the law faculty in Melbourne as part of the UTS Gibbs Constitutional Law Moot team, and now prospectively internationally in the Price Media Law Moot to be held in Oxford University in 2017. These were never on my mind when I first began competing, but they're a nice bonus to everything. The Brennan Justice and Leadership program is another extra-curricular I have cherished by a part of. I graduated the program by earning my leadership hours through my involvement in the LSS and volunteering for the Law Faculty. In 2017, I will be embarking on the inaugural Allens Neota UTS Law Legal Tech Challenge for Social Justice. This is the second of its kind in Australia, and I will be part of a team working alongside NGOs such as Anti-Slavery Australia and RACS to develop an app for a social justice objective of the NGOs' choosing. What would your advice be for someone who is looking at studying Law at UTS? What's commonly said is ""you miss 100% of the shots you don't take"", and I think that's entirely true. Put your hand up to be involved in every opportunity that arises, and worry about the logistics of your schedule later. University is always about what you put in, no matter who you are, where you are from, or where you are going. Your experience and development as a student, as a professional, and as a person, depends on your exposure to the wide variety of opportunities available to you. Don't waste this chance. Start from day one and give yourself the opportunity to enjoy university. Is there anything else you’d like to add about your experience at UTS:Law, or the University as a whole? Throughout my entire degree, UTS has taught me so much about the world around me, the people who fill it, and the role I can have in its future. For this, I will always have so much gratitude for UTS and the people in its walls. UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands.

https://www.uts.edu.au/isf/learning/short-courses/connecting-climate-and-circular-futures/climate-and-circular-plastics,"Part of the Connecting Climate and Circular Futures series of masterclasses presented by ISF in partnership with One Planet Consulting. Plastics are under pressure with changes underway in design, composition, targets, recycling, bans and deselection. This is the start, with more to come to shift for reuse, repair and recycling, and to cut losses, costs and emissions. Australia has a powerful position globally with full production supply chain and can do more to influence its own sustainable low emissions plastics future. What does the future hold with Australian and overseas trends and directives? From plastics packaging to pipe, from toys to textiles, what are the policies, financial incentives, regulations and partnerships to support smarter collections, production and use so we meet immediate bans and targets in 2022, 2025 and 2030? Ton is CEO of Werven Plastic Recycling, based in Netherlands with seven plants located across Europe and two more proposed in 2022. In 2021 his company processed a record quantity, over 200,000 tonnes of plastics. Werven Plastic Recycling is on a major growth path given the policies and demand for quality recyclate, and is significant amongst plastics companies given they handle 25 different plastics and sell 50 different formulations to global customers. Ton has been active in waste management and recycling since 1980. He is also Chair of the Dutch Recycling association, Vice Chair of the Supervisory Board of Holland Circular Hotspot, and Vice Chair of the European plastic value chain organisation, the Polyolefin Circular Economy Platform based in Brussels. Ton’s long and distinguished career and vision in business, industry, government and trade as practitioner and advocate means he has valuable insights on what works, consequences of policy decisions, and directions for the future. Helen provides research and strategic support to a range of industry and government clients on product stewardship and packaging sustainability. Helen has been actively engaged in product stewardship for almost 30 years, with various positions including strategic advisor and consultant tot he Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO) and CEO of the Australian Battery Recycling Initiative. In her previous roles at the Centre for Design at RMIT University, including 5 years as Director, she helped to establish some of the first programs in Australia on design for sustainability and life cycle assessment. Helen has written widely on product stewardship and corporate social responsibility including several books. She published Product stewardship in action in 2016and is a co-author of Packaging for sustainability (2012) and Design + Environment (2001). She is an Adjunct Professor with the Institute for Sustainable Futures (ISF) at the University of Technology Sydney and a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Packaging. Helen uniquely combines 30 years' expertise and experience in industry, business and government. She is currently advising the Australian Government and state governments on circular product design and systemic strategic changes to policies, strategies, targets, financial instruments and regulations. She is also collaborating with national peak industry associations on climate risks and emissions reductions. Helen has international networks in circular economy policies and effective programs, and depth in experience in packaging, plastics and organics. Recent roles include circular programs for the Vinyl Council of Australia, Victorian Government (Circular Economy action plan, Kerbside Reforms, renewable energy jobs fund) and the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation on strategic targets and recycled content. Helen has formal qualifications in business, carbon accounting, and through AICD in corporate governance. Helen has been recognised in several awards and scholarships, including a Churchill Fellowship and Victorian Government Women Leaders scholarship. Helen is currently Chair, Churchill Trust Committee; Board Advisor, Repeat Plastics (Replas) and co-founder of a new program Australian Associations on Climate and Emissions. Professor Damien Giurco is Deputy Director, Research at the Institute for Sustainable Futures. With a focus on responsible prosperity, Damien has worked collaboratively with government and industry spanning the minerals, water, waste and energy sectors on strategy, modelling and policy, including circular economy. Damien is a director of the Product Stewardship Centre of Excellence, chairs the advisory group for Ewaste Watch and was a member of the Expert Reference Group for the NSW 20 year waste strategy. Ton van der Giessen outlines some of the points he will cover in his presentation and his views on the economics and priorities for plastics going forward. He highlights some of the challenges we face with continued growth in plastics consumption and difficulties recovering waste plastics for a more circular future. Ton van der Giessen: Maybe also in 2040, I think only 10 percent of all the recycled plastics will be chemical recycled. And the rest is mechanical recycled. Sometimes a lot of people think that chemical recycling is the solution of the problem. I don’t think so because it needs a lot of energy and you have only one third of yield out of the chemical recycling unit. Compared to mechanical recycling, we take out 95 percent of all the plastics and with a chemical recycling plant, it is around 30-35 percent what you are getting out. When there is also not enough they’ll put too much in the chemical recycling because that is a high standard but that is not necessary use it as much in all kinds of other products. And also price wise I think it is not competitive for us as a recycling company. t: +61 2 9514 4950 e: isf@uts.edu.au Level 10, UTS Building 10 235 Jones Street Ultimo NSW 2007, AustraliaDirections Contact us for media requests and other enquiries Subscribe to newsletter UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/orthoptics-courses/orthoptics-student-profiles/zoe-deuxberry,"Tell us about yourself I grew up in Sydney and was born in Spain. When growing up, I was always interested in anything health or medical related. My Abuela used to be an army nurse, my mother worked in the medical device industry and when I was 11, my dad broke hip while skiing meaning at the young age of 34 he had to get a hip replacement! When finishing school, I was not sure where I wanted to go, so I did an undergraduate degree in Medical Science. I ended those three years still not knowing what I wanted to do! But I went to a UTS Postgraduate Information Night and learnt about Orthoptics. It was a field I had never heard about, but the sales pitch got me hooked and I applied, and I am glad I did because I have really loved it! What are you passionate about? Through doing a month-long placement in Darwin, I have realised I have a real interest and passion for remote health. Being able to provide services to people who live remotely is really rewarding. I also find strabismus (eye turns) incredibly interesting and love working with children and seeing how they improve with exercises and other management options. Giving people the chance to improve their vision or help stop or slow down the progression of vision loss is really great. Vision is something many people take for granted and many think that vision loss is only a problem for the elderly – when really, vision loss can happen at any stage of life, which is why it is important to take care of it. What inspired you to study this degree? Orthoptics is a growing field; not only in Australia, but in other countries around the world. I chose to study orthoptics because it is an allied health, it means I have the opportunity to see, manage and treat patients alongside working with Ophthalmologists. It is also a job that is flexible and allows for a great work-life balance. Due to the limited spots for learning, it is also a degree that can take you both around Australia or the world, where the degree is recognised. Why did you choose to study at UTS? I chose UTS because it is the only university in the South-Asia Pacific that offer Orthoptics as a postgraduate degree! What is the most rewarding aspect of the course? The part I love most about the course is how the teaching staff do not treat you like students, but as future colleagues – they really want you to succeed and become competent workers. This has also helped by the relatively small cohorts and plenty of hands-on practical classes. There is always someone willing to help, along with having online Facebook groups with the cohort, where everyone helps each other out, as we all want each other to succeed as well. There isn’t any competitiveness as we all help bring each other up to ensure that the people we are working with are people we know are the best orthoptists they can be. What do you hope to achieve in the future? I am hoping to work in the hospital system, however that can get quite competitive. I like working in a hospital setting because you get to see every aspect of eye health and that keeps the work constantly new and refreshing, rather than becoming bored with the same thing everyday! I think coming straight from graduating, I want to keep all of my skills up and continue to learn about everything until a time where I may find an area I enjoy more. What advice do you have for students who are considering the Master of Orthoptics? You may think that there is not a lot to know about eyes, but there is and there is a wide range of different jobs available that can cater to anyone’s goals and lifestyles – from hospitals, private clinics, research, management, or medical device sales representatives. In terms of the course itself: I’m not going to lie, it is hard work – you are squeezing a whole degree into two short years. It is very busy but achievable two years; full of hands on experience and plenty of clinical placements that will make you fall in love with the field. My name is Zoe and I'm studying a Master of Orthoptics. I got to the end of my Medical Science degree and had no idea what to do. To be honest I had no idea what an orthoptist was when I first heard of it and then when I found out about the course I thought it sounded pretty interesting. And what made me want to do it was you get to interact with patients, you get to do some management and treatment but you also get to work with doctors as well. And another selling point at the time was that there's definitely jobs in the area and it's a needed profession it's a growing area as well. In the word itself ortho is straight and optics is eyes so it started as a profession to straighten eyes but here in Australia we're also taught an ophthalmic side of it which is where we work with the ophthalmologists who are the eye doctors. The Master of Orthoptics at UTS is a two-year course and in the first year and a half you learn all of your content and then on top of that you also do research subjects and from second semester in your first year you start going out on placement so you spend almost as much time doing practical work as you do coursework. And everything you learn in your classes is directly related to what you learn in practical classes. And then on top of that you get such a varied amount of experiences through placement. They try and send you to as many different types of places as they can, so different public hospitals, private clinics, specialised clinics, so you get a really good understanding about all the different areas that you can possibly go into. My advice for anyone considering orthoptics is that it's a very rewarding career. Everyone's going to be behind you and everyone wants you to succeed. It's definitely worth it and I've loved my two years and I'm very glad I did Orthoptics.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/transdisciplinary-innovation/undergraduate-courses/creative-intelligence-and-innovation/student-experience,"The Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation (BCII) has had some extraordinary feedback – some spontaneous and some elicited – from students who have gone through the winter and summer school intensives. Here are just a few comments on the learning experience from the student perspective. [Music playing] Speaker 1: I would describe this course as an opportunity to learn extremely broadly, and particularly for someone that likes to think outside of the box – to think a bit creatively, to move laterally through topics. Speaker 2: It’s like this exciting opportunity to just take your brain to places where you haven’t been before and to think about the possibilities that are, like, trapped within the different disciplines. Speaker 3: I had a lot of conceptual-based ideas, so ideas about the way that, um, society is at the moment, the way that we can change it. Speaker 4: I’ve experienced over the start of the course – it’s, it’s like a springboard for launching new ideas. Speaker 5: This course really is about broadening your horizons. Whatever your passion is and your core subject, or in your life in general, they want you to take this further and develop your ideas and learn how to express and communicate your ideas to your wider community. Speaker 6: Today we are looking for places and times that otherwise remain invisible or meaningless in Kings Cross. Speaker 7: We were looking for things that provoked emotions; things that helped us understand our experience with our environment. Speaker 8: One of the most important places I think we found for our card would have to be an alley we went through, where one side was completely let up and the other side was in darkness, and it split the residential areas of Kings Cross. Speaker 9: We’re looking for signs of exploitation or flourishing economic environments. Speaker 10: We’re applying hugely divergent ideas and theories and it just gives you so much more freedom to, I guess, explore solutions, and really be at the cutting edge of your field. Speaker 11: It makes you think differently. It makes you – gives you all these opportunities to just think outside the box and completely tear an idea apart. It’s really, really cool. “It’s evident as a result of undertaking a new style of university education as opposed to the traditional style of large lectures, large tutorials and no interaction-based contact with academics, that something is wrong with the methods being taught within the status quo. The interdisciplinary way that the BCII is being taught, as well as the fantastic access to academics, has given students (myself included) a much greater ability to question things being told to us, rather than simply taking them as a blind truth.” “Pick an object, person, place, something. Now take everything you know about it and store it in a neat little box, labelled ‘preconceptions.’ Now – and this is the most important part – step out of that box and open your eyes, your ears, your imagination, to the world as it really is. Take this newfound understanding and sketch it, describe it, picture it, take another discipline’s perspective on it, reinvent the world as you know it: that is the art of the BCII.” “I have worked before in groups, but never have I been in a cohort where working with each person introduced a totally new possibility for business ventures. But above all, it is the people with you that make this course more than worth it.” “It is not your average course with a linear approach to learning. The singular perspective that can sometimes arise from focusing on a singular core degree for so long is erased by the crazy amount of perspectives and ideas that are thrown at you within a span of two weeks.” “Aspects and lessons from my own life, combined with the required readings, as well as BCII workshops and lectures, came together in the discovery and absolute certainty of the potential of diverse groups of people. This was already something I theoretically ‘knew’ yet here the reality of it all really hit me…Facing real-world problems in a place so close to home, really shows how powerful and useful this degree is going to be in the upcoming years as a catalyst for change in the following generations.” “The foundation of an Ideas Arena provided a rich resource hub of creativity, innovation, images, ideas, theories and tests. The ideas were abstract. They were fluid. They were full of life, meaning, and purpose. Yet they were disorientating. We were challenged to see the possibilities out there; to think of our own speculative proposals, what-if scenarios, and thought experiments; to act on our own ideas and inspirations.” “With the creation of BCII we are now given tools and methods that range over a broad spectrum. The most important part is how to use each discipline’s methods to be able to see the world through a new lens.” “As an individual my ability to link business information and material to creative expressions and outlets has improved dramatically. The ability to observe the creative process of design students and the methodical reasoning of I.T students has proven invaluable to the end result of this subject, and the beginning of this degree.” “During the final presentations, I found it quite amazing that such creative and original insights were formed in an incredibly small amount of time. It is especially amazing when there are people whose full-time job it is to create these ideas and plans for a city. I feel that people become caught up in the repetition and monotony of their work, and cannot think innovatively or progress. This is why I love BCII: to be constantly reminded that you must 'think different' in order to excel creatively within any field.” Creative Intelligence and Innovation Essential information Available combined degrees Career options UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/business-courses/graduate-research/economics-phd-program,"At the heart of a great graduate program is a first-rate training in the foundations of Economic Theory and Econometrics. In our Economics PhD Program, this outcome is achieved via a program of ‘core’ PhD classes, taken by all students, which provide the concepts and analytical tools required of every economist. In addition, each student develops expertise through field subjects in which students study advanced topics and become familiar with the frontiers of research in that field. A list of the fields to be offered is provided below. This program will normally require five years to complete. Significant scholarship support, free from teaching obligations, is awarded competitively. There will also be opportunities for additional financial support from teaching assistant or research assistant roles. The program will be synchronised with programs in North America, Europe, and Asia. We aim to routinely place students in regular tenure-track academic positions in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. The PhD in Economics requires the completion of nine high-level coursework subjects, five research field subjects, and three years of research producing a PhD thesis. PhD students in Economics progress through the degree in three stages, as outlined in the UTS Business School Doctoral Framework, and use the Graduate Research Study Plan (GRSP) to plan, monitor, and review their progress. The coursework component of the PhD in Economics consists of nine core subjects and five research field subjects. The core subjects provide the foundational knowledge essential to first-rate research. The research field subjects take PhD students to the frontiers of research. Year 1: Students receive rigorous training in Economic Theory and Econometrics. At the end of their first year, students must pass comprehensive exams in Econometrics and Economic Theory in order to continue the program. Year 2: Students complete the core coursework and take research field subjects in their research areas. Year 3: Students continue to take research field subjects in their research areas. The program offers a variety of research field subjects to provide state-of-the-art training in economics research. The topics offered reflect the diversity of research strengths of the department, and include: A Master of Business Thesis will be due at the end of Year 2. Upon completion of a Master's Thesis and the first two years of coursework, students will be awarded Master of Business (Research). Students will present their papers in the Economics PhD Conference in August, attended by faculty and graduate students. The conference achieves several important objectives. It provides students with the opportunity to develop the presentation skills they will need when on the job market and afterwards. It fosters a research environment among the graduate students – in a good graduate program students learn a great deal from other graduate students. Finally, it ensures that all students are making good progress as they transition from coursework to research. By the end of their second year, students should have chosen their Primary Supervisor and the other two members of their Supervisory Panel. Years 3-5: Students are expected to participate in the research activities of the department. They should attend and participate in the department seminar series. At the end of Years 3, 4 and 5, students will present their papers at the Economics PhD Conference, attended by faculty and graduate students. Students should have three complete research papers by Year 5. One of these papers should be polished and suitable for serving as the student’s “job market” paper. At the end of the fifth year, students defend and submit their thesis for external examination. A thesis will typically consist of three high-quality chapters, with a brief introduction and conclusion. It should be the view of the students' Supervisory Panel that each chapter will be suitable for submission for publication after further development and polishing. The final thesis will be examined by at least two external examiners. Significant scholarship support, free from teaching obligations, is awarded competitively. There are also opportunities for additional financial support from teaching assistant or research assistant roles. Teaching experience is an integral part of PhD training. Many academic employers expect new assistant professors to have experience either as teaching assistants or an instructor of their own classes. Students will have various teaching or research opportunities of their interest while in the program. For admission requirements, fees, and other details, visit Doctor of Philosophy. The Program runs in sync with programs in the US and Europe with courses starting towards the end of July. Those interested in applying to the PhD Program in Economics at UTS should submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) form. To complete your EOI, make sure that a minimum of two (preferably three) confidential letters of recommendation are sent by the referees (not by the applicant) to BusinessHDR@uts.edu.au. Questions about applying should be directed to the Business Research Office at BusinessHDR@uts.edu.au or the Economics PhD Admission Officer at PhD.Economics.Admission@uts.edu.au.

I also work one day a week at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC - right next door to uni!) where I am an Operations Group intern. Here, I have rotated around the Operations Group, including their Audit, Financial Control, Operations & Planning, Capital Works, Technology and Tax divisions. This job is directly related to my business and law degree as I have contributed to compliance work relating to, among other things, contract management, accounting and audit work. Further, I’ve also secured a full-time summer and winter internship at Telstra, working with their in-house legal team as a Legal Intern in their Consumer, M&A and Global Enterprise & Services legal teams. Being a legal intern, this job is directly related to my law degree and it was so great to see that a lot of their lawyers had been UTS:LAW alumni! How do you manage the competing demands of university and work? A lovely teacher and mentor of mine in high school always told me that “organisation is the key to success”. Law school has taught me the great value of this mantra and it is something I will always live by. The only way I can be organised is by living a very balanced lifestyle where I make sure I get a healthy amount of sleep, food and exercise - I think that students undertaking a combined degree in business and law will eventually find the value in ensuring a healthy mind, body and spirit. Further, I always dedicate an amount of time during the day and night to simply do nothing but relax, reflect and let my mind and body unwind. What led you to choose UTS:LAW for your studies Comparing all the law schools in Sydney, I found that the UTS Law School was well-suited for my personal approach to learning. I always learn best in interactive, innovative and practical settings where there is conversation and dialogue and most importantly, real-life applications to learning. The UTS Law Faculty and its staff are renowned for harnessing the constant growth of technology to provide an inventive, pragmatic and relevant approach to teaching. What is the most rewarding aspect of your degree? Why? So far, the most rewarding aspect of my degree would be my role as a peer tutor teaching younger law students. I gain a sense of achievement gained after each lesson with my students, knowing I can help positively shape their learning, ethics, morals and beliefs - and ultimately, their maturity as a law student. Ironically, after most of my lessons I feel that I’m doing most of the learning as my students often each have their own personal wisdoms and understanding to learning, law and life! Where would you like your double degree to take your career? The best thing about undertaking a double degree is that it provides different opportunities to unique and remarkable career paths. I often feel that I ought to give everything a go before settling down with a career choice. However, whether I choose to become a lawyer, regulator or banker, I know I’ll be able to harness the invaluable technical wisdom I have gained studying at UTS to see me in a leadership position where I can create a dynamic change that will disrupt the business and legal world! Are you involved in extra-curricular activities such as the Mentoring program, Brennan program, Mooting, LSS? How has this experience aided your career/personal development? I am involved with almost all of the programs within the LSS and I’m also involved in mentoring initiatives and young lawyers associations with the NSW Bar Association and the NSW Law Society. The greatest advantage in participating in so many extra-curricular activities is that it helps you build strong networks and friendships with experienced lawyers and law students, and access to wonderful legal opportunities and mentors. For example, one day I was able to casually shadow the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of NSW (The Hon. Thomas Bathurst) and His Honour’s tipstaff with the help of my networks and mentor at the NSW Bar Association! What would your advice be for someone who is looking at studying Law at UTS? The trick to succeeding in law school is threefold. First, live a balanced lifestyle nurturing a healthy mind, body and spirit. Second, do whatever it takes to find a mentor already practicing law - they’re always full of contagious passion and wisdom and have already gone through what you’re about to! And finally, always remember that organisation is the key to success! Is there anything else you’d like to add about your experience at UTS:LAW, or the University as a whole? Every university has innovative facilities, new technologies and a different learning style. What makes UTS so different from all other Sydney universities is its greatest asset - its teaching staff. I absolutely enjoy the passion, creativity, and intelligence possessed by the staff and it is the learning environment they create that give me the confidence and security to proudly exclaim that there would be no place I’d rather be when it comes to studying business and law! UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands. We would also like to pay respect to the Elders both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for these lands.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/law/courses/undergraduate-law/course-experience/undergraduate-profiles/nicholas-bentley,"What led you to choose UTS:Law for your studies? After attending the UTS Open Day I knew I had found the right university for me. Though I had no idea what courses I was interested in, UTS as an institution was down to earth and friendly. There is no ivory tower attitude and everyone you meet is unique and interesting. Ultimately, I ended up choosing law after meeting several of the older UTS law students. They were not only intelligent and engaging, but were genuinely interesting, well rounded people. For me it is the people at UTS who make it the unique and engaging place that it is. The ability to just study law, or to combine it with another degree, also attracted me to UTS. Despite the fact that I eventually combined my legal studies with a business degree, it was apparent that everything at UTS was flexible. In my first year I was able to receive a sports scholarship that allowed me to manage strenuous sporting commitments with my study goals. It was all these factors combined that led me to choose UTS. If you are working while you are studying, what does your job involve? During the first few years of my degree I was lucky enough to work in a small solicitor office. After undertaking a summer law clerkship in my fourth year I worked at a law firm as a clerk while completing my final year of core subjects. This year I am working as a Tipstaff in the Supreme Court of NSW while completing my research honours thesis. As a law clerk in a large law firm you gain an understanding of how the concepts and notions taught in law school are applied in practice. I worked in a litigation and dispute resolution team, which required me to undertake lots of legal research, document proofing and court attendance. There were some days where I would be taking notes in the Federal Court during a hearing, and would then be sitting in class that very evening. This mix of practical and theoretical learning was a great experience that I will always value and which only UTS could easily provide, since it is located just outside the Sydney CBD. This year while writing my thesis I am working full time for a Supreme Court Judge. As a Tipstaff I assist the judge in court and in chambers. The role involves continuous legal research, judgment editing, and liaising between the Court registry and parties involved in proceedings. How do you balance study and work commitments? Fortunately for me, at UTS you are able to pick your subjects for the entire upcoming year, while also being able to create your class timetable so that you can plan ahead to fit study in with your workdays and other commitments. UTS supports its law students early on through the Law Peer Mentoring Program, run jointly by the Faculty and the UTS Law Students’ Society. Through this program older students give study and social advice to first years so that students can gain an understanding of the demands and requirements of law school. Getting this guidance early on was critical for me in learning how to balance my work and study commitments. I feel very lucky to be able to work full time while writing my thesis. The Law Honours Program is very flexible and doesn’t require you to attend any set classes during the semester. I am able to visit my research supervisor after work hours, fitting in with my work schedule and extracurricular commitments. How have/will your studies at UTS contributed to your career? How have they informed the way you work? UTS: Law is renowned for its practicality. In class you do not just learn what the law is, but you also gain an understanding of how to apply the law to scenarios and issues that occur in our everyday society. At both my law firm, and as a Tipstaff, I have been able to continuously apply what I have learnt at university to my work. Indeed, both my former and current employers have commented on how UTS students seem to require less on the job training, as they leave law school ready to face real world legal problems. What is the most rewarding aspect of your degree? Why? The most rewarding aspect has been the social and career building activities offered by UTS. As a UTS law student I was able to compete in university and intervarsity negotiation, client interviewing, mooting and witness examination law competitions throughout my studies. I was also able to give back to the UTS student body as a competition director and Vice President of the UTS Law Students’ Society, while also serving as President of the University Union in my 5th year. All of these ‘outside of the classroom’ experiences really complemented my learning, allowing me to develop as an individual as I prepared to commence my future legal career. What would your advice be for someone who is looking at studying Law at UTS? If you want to enjoy your university experience while knowing that you are giving yourself the best possible chance for a successful future career, then UTS:Law is for you. I would suggest that you attend the open days and law info events offered by the University and the Law Faculty. Talk to the law students and the academics and discover what wonderful opportunities await you as a UTS Law student. Is there anything else you’d like to add about your experience at UTS:Law, or the University as a whole? I know that I will reflect on my years at UTS as some of the most enjoyable. Everyone at UTS is given the ability to do so much more than simply attend classes. It is these opportunities that allow you make your university experience extremely unique and rewarding. As a UTS Law student you are able to discover what interests you, both in and outside of the law. By UTS fostering your interests and desires, it makes learning and working all the more enjoyable.\ UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands.

Global energy systems are undergoing a period of accelerated change in the bid to achieve sustainable growth. Transitions in this sector have resulted in an increased demand for professionals with knowledge and experience in power electronic interfaces, distributed energy resources, improved modelling, control and optimisation. We have designed this series of modular courses to provide professional engineers and decision makers with the current, cutting edge knowledge that is required to thrive in this rapidly evolving industry. Each separate module is delivered though a half-day virtual classroom session. The modules can be combined and customised depending on the context, needs and priorities of you and your team. This course is intended for professional engineers and decision makers. After completing all of the modules in this series you will be able to: Each module is offered as a half-day virtual classroom session, these modules can be combined and customised depending on the training needs of you and your team. Electric vehicles (EVs) are the future of transportation and their usage is increasing significantly worldwide. The uptake of EVs are an essential part of the energy transition strategy, which will result in significant changes for vehicle manufacturers, government, companies and individuals. In this module, you will be given a comprehensive overview of the technology of electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and electric mobility. You will develop a deeper fundamental understanding of the technology behind electric cars, electrical machines, charging technology, infrastructure and the role of electric vehicles in the energy transition strategy. The integration of small-scale renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind energy, has increased significantly in developed countries including Australia, however the variability of wind and solar power does not fully correspond with demand, and can create challenges associated with reliability and economic viability. Advanced power electronic converters and controllers are required to ensure the resilient operation of power systems with large-scale renewable energy sources and microgrids. This module will provide an overview of the technological advancements in renewable energy systems, microgrids, smart power electronics interfaces and controls for managing the impacts of integrating large-scale renewable sources. Smart and active distribution systems will play a key role in the future of smart grids with emerging technologies such as distributed generation, renewable energy, microgrid and consumer engagement. This module looks at the challenges associated with the planning, engineering, design and operation of electrical distribution systems and smart grid systems. Smart grids will be a major contributor to next generation electricity grids, with secure communication systems, optimised operation and advanced control. The implementation and management of smart grids requires a number of new tools and techniques. This module is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary for designing, analysing and controlling smart grids with secure communication systems. You will also acquire knowledge in cyber-physical systems, IoT enabled fault tolerance and dependable control. With the deep penetration of renewable energy generation and emerging distributed energy management technologies, there are significant opportunities to modernise the current grid towards the smart grid to improve its efficiency and performance through market-based transactive exchanges between energy producers and energy consumers. This module looks at the concepts and frameworks associated with transactive energy as a new economic tool, and explores the potential of transactive energy to improve the resilience, safety, efficiency, reliability and adaptability of the grid. Technological developments have significantly impacted energy storage systems, which have gained wider adoption in power systems to facilitate the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources, improve power quality and increase both energy and power densities. Developments in this area are largely due to the availability of new materials, improved power and energy management technologies and requirements resulting from more challenging working environments. This module provides an overview of the latest technologies and applications associated with batteries, supercapacitors and superconductors. Power electronics converters play an essential role in today’s power grids and will undoubtedly be a key enabling technology in next generation power systems. Currently there is a need to integrate more renewable energy sources and energy storage sources to the power grid, while increasing its reliability. In this new context, power electronics technology is vital in the modernisation of the power grid. At the transmission level, power converters provide flexibility to the grid in terms of power flow control, voltage regulation/reactive power injection control, and HVDC power transmission. At the distribution level, power converters can be used for load compensation, harmonic reduction, dynamic voltage support, distributed energy resources, energy storage systems and microgrids. This module is designed to provide you with the necessary knowledge and skills on power electronics operations and control in order to satisfy the needs of next generation power systems.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/speech-pathology-courses/speech-pathology-student-profiles/tanya-ramadan,"I studied an undergraduate degree in science majoring in neuroscience and physiology before starting my Master of Speech Pathology at UTS. I am currently part of the Speech Pathology Australia Early Career Reference group which focuses on identifying concerns faced by early-career speech pathologists and working to identify and provide support. When I'm not working or spending time with my family, I like to read, bake, and listen to podcasts and one day I hope to publish a novel. I am extremely passionate about playing a role in person-focused interactions. I aspire to do this by contributing to health practices that place the patient at the centre of all care, treating patients holistically and as a full person rather than a condition, and creating environments where my colleagues, patients, and everyone I interact with feel heard and valued. A series of speech pathology podcasts resonated with me and inspired me to pursue this degree. The speech pathologists I was listening to seemed to work in areas that utilised my interests in health science and apply my theoretical knowledge for the betterment of others. Once I started the degree, I knew there was nothing that would stop me from being part of this profession. The UTS Speech Pathology course interested me as it allowed me to develop my clinical skills and be involved in research. Prior to studying at UTS, I worked in a research lab which showed me the importance of being involved in ongoing research for the advancement of knowledge and best practice. The UTS course has research-based subjects and the option of taking part in a research project which provided me with the skills I felt I needed to be part of that ongoing growth within the profession. Further, learning from lecturers who are involved in the latest research, have a forward focus on preparing speech pathologists for the future, and have clinical experience themselves seemed an ideal environment for my learning and preparation for the working world. Taking part in the UTS course taught me more than I had anticipated. I learnt how to holistically support people with swallowing and communication concerns across the lifespan from newborn babies with feeding difficulties to adults with Parkinson's Disease. I learnt how to support clients and family members to communicate more effectively when they may be struggling, how changes can be made in classrooms to support student involvement, how to utilise people's strengths, and how to keep people connected to the things they love. So many elements of the course are rewarding. I felt that learning from staff who celebrated your achievements and so clearly cared about each student's growth and development was extremely rewarding as it allowed me to view myself as capable (because if experienced clinicians believed in me, why wouldn't I believe in myself). I am also very thankful for the diverse and invaluable experiences of clinical placements as they prepared me for my role as a clinician. As a speech pathologist and during clinical placements, you see people at their most vulnerable and when they may be struggling. But being part of that person's journey is very rewarding as you regularly see your patients and collaborate with them to support their goal progression. As a result, you celebrate each patient's successes no matter how big or small with them, and it's very special to be part of that. I found it very important to create a divide between my studies and the things I did that make me feel fulfilled outside of my career. I found that dedicating time every day to other activities like walking, calling a friend and even calling a friend during my morning walk was so important for my overall well-being. Everyone has different needs and interests and taking the time to reflect and identify what works for you helps reduce burnout and makes your day feel a lot more balanced. It was clear the staff worked extremely hard to replicate the face to face learning experience online. I think the greatest thing lecturers did was maintain the interactive nature of classes through utilising breakout rooms and discussion-based learning. This meant I still felt connected to my peers and the staff even during larger lockdowns where I wasn't in a position to leave my house. I currently work within NSW Health specifically with an adult caseload. This means I see patients with swallowing and communication concerns specifically supporting them during their time in the hospital and preparing them for when they are discharged. Every day I work I utilise the knowledge I built in my degree about speech, language, swallowing, voice, and fluency disorders as well as the professional skills I gained from my placements, my assessments, and the feedback and guidance I received from my lecturers. I aspire to continue growing within the field I work in. I hope to grow my skills clinically and be in a supervisory role for students and other speech pathologists. I aspire to play a role in quality improvement within the workplace and potentially on a larger scale. I also hope I will be fortunate enough to be involved in teaching and do as my lecturers did for me; supporting students to support their patients. This course is a commitment but it is a great place to be with staff that will support you and your place within the profession and perfectly sized classes that allow you to connect with your classmates and future colleagues. If you are interested in supporting people's quality of life and want to learn from speech pathologists who always make learning clinically relevant then this course is a great choice.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/law/courses/undergraduate-law/course-experience/undergraduate-profiles/antoine-najjarin,"What led you to choose UTS:Law for your studies? Firstly, I was adamant on studying a law degree since high school – my exposure to consumer rights and protections in ‘Legal Studies’ was, perhaps, the causative reason. It was an area of law that affected us at a personal level, and made me acutely aware of how close the legal system was in governing our day-to-day relations. After realising the direction I wished to take, the second issue quickly arose: which university? Herein I will consider the reasons for selecting UTS:Law over its sandstone competitors. Upon reflection, there may have been too many reasons, but for the sake of brevity I will address the significantly attractive features. The UTS Law faculty is quite renowned for its practicality in teaching and, thus, the quality of lawyers it often produces. This was a highly desirable quality, as every student considers employment prospects resulting from university study. Enrolling with a well-respected institution was a primary concern, and UTS was more than sufficient in this respect. Further, UTS was the most generous institution in providing scholarship awards and financial assistance to students. In fact, I was quite privileged in receiving the Vice-Chancellor’s Merits Scholarship. If you are working while you are studying, what does your job involve? I currently work as a research assistant. This, primarily, involves researching cases and statute to assist legal counsel with urgent matters. How do you balance study and work commitments? By being reasonable and practical with my limitations in, both, time and physical capacity. Every student must recognise their limitations, and undertake commitments accordingly. A stringent deadline assists in pushing oneself to work at full capacity; however, flexibility is also a necessary quality in adapting to challenging circumstances which may require more time than, initially, planned. Efficiency in utilising one’s time and resources is a discipline that develops with constant practice, and a hardened fortitude. In saying this, I’ll have to reverberate the platitude that every student needs to “work hard and play hard” as it is incredibly essential to a balanced mental and physical lifestyle. Reserving time over the weekend for church services, exercise, family gatherings and friends is important in maintaining steady working commitments during the week. The quality of one’s work is often reflected by the quality of their greater life. How have/will your studies at UTS contributed to your career? How have they informed the way you work? Presently, the law faculty’s practical approach to teaching has assisted me in developing an efficient work ethic. This is essential as a research assistant, as I am often faced with an insurmountable number of articles, case law and statute that requires analysis within an allocated period of time. Being able to discern between relevant and irrelevant information at any given moment is an invaluable quality that I accredit UTS with developing. Further, the faculty’s focus on oral participation has positively contributed towards my communication skills in the workplace, as succinctly and accurately conveying ideas between colleagues is an essential attribute for any prospective lawyer. UTS has, also, assisted me in developing a clearer future career path upon the completion of my studies. Exposure to commercial and international law, as well as the close entwinement of both areas of study is a personal interest of mine. I must accredit the vast array of electives available at UTS for assisting me in determining where my interests arise, as well as facilitating international study to further realise a potential career path (as I will be studying international human rights law at Oxford University). What is the most rewarding aspect of your degree? Why? Initially, I was struggling to prioritise between the following three rewarding aspects: engagement with amazing lecturers; participating in mooting competitions; and the close community developed throughout my degree. However, I realised that each has facilitated underlying personal growth and development. I remember starting university as quite a shy and inward student. I was crushed by the illusion of never developing into an adept legal advocate, or having the self-confidence to effectively communicate with lecturers and fellow peers. These concerns quickly dissipated. To attest to this, I was recently awarded the best oralist in the grand final of a mooting competition before the honourable Justice Leeming, Keith Mason (former president of the NSW Court of Appeal), and Professor Simone Degeling. Through its staff, facilities and events, UTS fosters an incredibly constructive environment for personal growth. Developing confidence in my own ability has been, by far, the most rewarding aspect of my degree. What would your advice be for someone who is looking at studying Law at UTS? To provide a terse statement of advice, I would suggest that any prospective law student engage with the vast competitions and extra-curricular activities available, as well as actively attempt to constantly challenge their current conceptions and understandings. In saying this, it’s important to never lose sight of your individual perspective which is an invaluable quality for prospective lawyers – especially, in driving law reform.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/business/business-courses/study-economics/postgraduate-options-behavioural-economics,"Explore this leading postgraduate program in behavioural economics, a field that brings together psychology and economics. Get our info pack This groundbreaking newly developed postgraduate program trains students in behavioural economics, a field that brings together psychology and economics to better describe and predict what people will do. Behavioural economics takes the methodology of economic theory beyond the standard economic assumptions of rationality and self-interest to consider the trade-offs people make when forming what may well be imperfect decisions in complex environments. Its insights can be used in a wide range of settings, including financial decision making, health decisions, education decisions and in addressing environmental issues like climate change. It’s useful across many domains, including fields such as consulting, financial services, human resource management, marketing and product design. People with training in this field are in demand across a broad range of business and policymaking settings. Jason: There are more possible games of chess than there are atoms in the observable universe. We cannot possibly consider all the options. The economic decisions we make every day, whether buying a coffee or buying a house, are even more complex. And like when we play chess, we are often able to make a functional decision. We do this using heuristics, mental shortcuts that enable us to survive and thrive in a complex would. But we are often unaware of the real reasons why we’ve made a given decision and what may have influenced us in the process of making up our mind. Elif: Behavioural economics is the discipline, merging the insights from psychology and the principles of economics to understand how people make decisions. It tells us why people sometimes make mistakes. Why sometimes people do not know what they want or why they fail to carry out their personal plans. Jingjing: With the knowledge gained from behavioural economics. We can help people make better decisions for themselves. We can understand how people interact in groups and networks and how these social environments shape their values and behaviour. Jason: We have launched a new Masters in Behavioural Economics at UTS. This program teaches the foundations of behavioural economics and how to apply them in the real world. UTS has an outstanding group of researchers in this area with extensive experience in industry and policy application. Jingjing: A key aim of the program is to give you the practical skills to use behavioural economics in your professional life. You will learn to design and run trials to study how people behave in different situations. Elif: You will learn behavioural principles and techniques in the context of practical, economic, and financial decisions, whether it is understanding how consumers choose complex banking products or how companies organize teamwork. This will give you a new grasp of the world around you and new skills to change it for the better. Jason: Behavioural economics provides a set of skills in demand everywhere, from private companies to government bodies. Join us for a new journey. Economics is about how we organise society. Behavioural economics helps us understand why people make the decisions they do, and how we can help them make better decisions for themselves. — Dr Jason Collins, Program Director, UTS Business School Choose from: Delivered in a blend of face-to-face and online learning, the UTS Behavioural Economics postgraduate program provides students from diverse professional backgrounds with a thorough understanding of the principles of behavioural economics and its application in the real world.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/good-manufacturing-practice-courses,"Join us in 2023 Info session Course guide (PDF) Enquire now Our Good Manufacturing Practice programs are designed for students who seek in-depth knowledge of regulations, compliance, process development and quality assurance in the pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology sectors. Gain expert knowledge of Quality and Good Manufacturing Practice to meet TGA, FDA, EU and PIC/S requirements, and specialise in your chosen stream with this modular degree. UTS GSH has partnered with SeerPharma, the industry’s leading provider of technical compliance and QA knowledge to deliver innovative, university-accredited graduate programs in Good Manufacturing Practice. Practice-based and contemporary, the programs are unique in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. You will learn from industry-based experts who have spent many years working with pharmaceuticals, biologics and/or medical device companies. The units of study cover all stages of the product life cycle -from pre-clinical and clinical through to commercial manufacturing. Industry-based research projects may also be offered to students on the basis of availability and merit, helping students to build relationships with local industry. Offered on-campus or online (distance mode): Speaker 1: The GMP programme offered at UTS is a collaboration with SeerPharma, a leading training and consulting organisation, focusing on the quality assurance and compliances areas in the life sciences. The advantage of a collaboration with SeerPharma is that the students get to benefit from the experience of the teachers, and also from our context in the industry in terms of arranging site visits and guest lecturers. Speaker 2: UTS GMP offering is really important for two reasons. The first reason is there is no other university across this region, which offers this unique course. And the second reason is the students actually get well-equipped in the area of good manufacturing practice, which they really need to use in industry setup, once they are employed in a particular industry Speaker 3: iNova pharmaceuticals has been hosting students for their research projects for almost three years now. We take in four students each year, and one of those students will receive an award from iNova. Speaker 1: The GMP courses are offered in two modes. There's the standard on-campus learning mode, in which there's a mix of student-led learning and collaborative workshops led by the teacher. In the distance learning mode, students learn independently in a collaborative online environment. Speaker 3: I decided to study GMP at UTS because it gives you a clear picture on best practice international GMPs in different countries like USA, Australia, European countries. And this course also offers you a Master of Good Manufacturing degree. Speaker 1: There are many varied career options. And whilst a typical path is probably to go into quality assurance areas of the pharmaceutical industry, there are also options in the veterinary industry, food industry and in areas such as consulting regulatory affairs and in laboratories. Speaker 4: I think the biggest thing is actually how immediately applicable what I've been studying has been to my everyday work. Given the practical applications of this course to my current role in the pharmaceutical industry, it made a lot of sense for me to understand the conditions that the facility that I'm transferring into work under. And that meant this course was going to be very useful. Speaker 2 : Australia and internationally, there are quite a significant number of pharmaceutical, biotech med device industries are existing and every single industry look for the graduates: those who are well equipped and skilled with the attributes, knowledge and skills of good manufacturing practices. You can map out a pathway for your professional advancement, ranging from entry into the pharmaceutical, medical device or biotechnology sectors to senior and executive management. A qualification in Good Manufacturing Practice is also relevant for pharmacists who are seeking a career in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical devices and allied industry. There is a great demand for industrial pharmacists in Australia, making advanced good manufacturing practice skills highly desirable. Students can enter or exit this course at Graduate Diploma or Graduate Certificate, providing they meet the requirements of each degree. The Graduate Certificate in Good Manufacturing Practice articulates into the Graduate Diploma in Good Manufacturing Practice, which is an exit point for students enrolled in the Master’s course. Our Good Manufacturing Practice courses have two intakes per year - Autumn and Spring. The program operates on Calendar B. The online delivery of this course is designed for professionals looking to upskill in the area of good manufacturing practice.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/physiotherapy-courses/physiotherapy-student-profiles/tye-sieger,"I grew up in Merimbula which is a beautiful small quiet coastal town on the far south coast of NSW. My childhood was mainly spent surfing, skating, playing footy (AFL) and tennis, playing guitar and bumming around the beach whenever possible. At school I was always interested in sports and I enjoyed knowing how the body worked, but throughout high school I was encouraged to pursue engineering by my teachers. I didn’t set the world on fire at high school and ended up just scraping into an engineering degree at the University of Wollongong (UOW), however, I dropped out before my first session was over and moved back home for a year due to my father passing away. I took a year off studying and then decided to transfer into Exercise Science. After completing exercise science I was accepted to study Physiotherapy at UTS. Looking back, I think the main thing that attracted me to physiotherapy was my desire to help people and my love of sports. At school I never considered studying physiotherapy as I was pushed towards engineering by my Careers Advisor. So, I ended up starting a Bachelor of Engineering. During this time a few of my friends were studying Exercise Science and told me about the course. I transferred across from Engineering after my year off and never looked back. By my second year in Exercise Science I knew I wanted a skillset that would allow me to help the broader population. I was confident that I could be a very good physiotherapist and so from that point on I knew I wanted to do a Master of Physiotherapy. The small cohort was a huge factor in my decision to study at UTS. I also enjoyed that the course was new and innovative. As physiotherapy is an ever-evolving discipline, it made sense to me to come to the newest degree in the country. I also liked the idea of being one of the first students to graduate and experience the degree. I heard about the UTS Graduate School of Health through my course co-ordinator at the. He only spoke highly of it and the other courses that it offered. By far the most rewarding aspect of the course is the friendships I’ve made so far. I’ve also enjoyed the self-development I have experienced and the challenges that this degree has dealt me. I think I have changed and developed throughout my study here. I approach problems and situations more analytically, I communicate better and I find solutions to problems now where I think I wouldn’t have before. I have definitely been pushed to think differently and I am more professional now than I was before entering the degree. My knowledge of the discipline has expanded enormously and I see a far bigger scope to physiotherapy than I imagined before I started. Most of the assessments cover situations you would deal with in the real world. They are very practical and force you to take what you have learnt in class and apply it to different situations, giving you a good context on where you will use your new skills as physiotherapists. They are very evenly spaced out and at no point do you really feel overwhelmed with your assessment workload, which is great because you don’t have to sacrifice learning new content for completing your assessments. The teaching staff look after us really well. As I mentioned, the assessment schedule is set up so we never really were overwhelmed with assessment work. But if we ever found a week challenging or felt like we needed support, the teaching staff are always happy to have an open dialogue about helping us through that period. They really want you to do well and get to the end of the degree both happy and accomplished. My hope for the future is just to be a great physiotherapist, but more importantly a great person. I want to be able to help patients I encounter and improve their quality of life. I want to be the physio that patients want to see because I can do my job well and because they enjoy my company. Contributing something substantial to the profession would also be great. Completing a PhD is also something I am keen on pursuing. The research subjects offered here are encouraging me towards that option. My advice for future students: Do not be afraid to make mistakes - no one will ever judge you for hopping up in front of the class and trying something. Every mistake is a learning experience, and not only will you learn from it, but everyone else will too. Identifying the gaps in your knowledge is a huge part of progressing as a student and as a physiotherapist. But with that in mind, be confident with yourself. If you exude confidence everyone else will feel comfortable with what you are doing. Also, don’t be worried if you do something slightly different than someone else. You’ll get sick of how many people tell you that every physiotherapist treats differently, but it’s true. Don’t be scared to adapt something to suit you. And lastly, if you ever have trouble with anything, come and chat to us second year students. Everyone is super lovely and I’m sure everyone will always have time for a quick chat! The UTS GSH is an exceptionally positive environment, and studying here has only cemented my desire to be a physiotherapist. Every day I get inspired by either my peers or my teachers to get better at what I do.

If you’re looking to progress or change the direction of your professional trajectory, a master’s degree can give you a boost. But for many students, the cost and time commitments, coupled with rigid course structures, can make postgraduate study a fraught proposition. Enter the Master of Technology and the Master of Professional Practice, two highly customisable new course offerings available at UTS. Led by Associate Professor Natalie Lloyd, these courses are aimed at established professionals in industries like business, engineering, IT or law; or in sectors like government, education, heath, the arts and social sciences, respectively, who want to move into leadership roles in increasingly transdisciplinary workplaces, build specialist expertise in a chosen area of practice, or increase their employability. Associate Profession Natalie Lloyd People are working in much more transdisciplinary or interdisciplinary ways and grappling with really complex problems that require more collaborative, integrated approaches to problem solving. That’s what these degrees really aim to tap into. The new courses are part of a broader UTS approach to disrupting traditional models of postgraduate study and it’s an approach that Lloyd, an engineer turned transformational education leader, is more than ready for. Over the past few years, she’s made a name for herself as an education researcher and curriculum designer, most notably for her ability to produce truly transdisciplinary learning experiences that bring together collaborators from across disciplines, industries, institutions and countries. In particular, she’s focused on tertiary learning transformation and its relationship to the future of work that is, how people work and how their sense of professional identity and their approaches to professional practice are changing over time. The Master of Technology and the Master of Professional Practice sit at the nexus of these two ideas: that the nature of work is changing, and that people’s understanding of their place within work is changing with it. “In the past, we might have talked about engaging stakeholder perspectives, but now we realise it’s beyond just engaging or harnessing or capturing those perspectives; it’s about working with stakeholders and other disciplines to codesign solutions and creatively look at problems in new ways and with different perspectives,” she says. Key to both courses is a series of studios in which students will engage in an iterative approach of solve-build-reflect-design in order to tackle open ended problems impacting a range of industry sectors. They’ll study under the guidance of leading academics and industry connected mentors, building collaborative networks with their student peers. The core studios can see students working on real-world issues that impact a range of industry sectors. The intention is that we will have industry connections for those studios so that problems can be seeded by industry and supported by industry in setting the context of discussion, Lloyd says. The studios will be supplemented by a series of highly flexible submajors, some that are pre-defined as part of the course, and others that can be configured to meet students’ individual learning goals. With the guidance of a Learning Concierge (Learning Advisor) who codesigns each student’s proposed course structure in relation to their personal and professional goals, participants can select made-to-fit studio options and submajors that reflect their current and future career needs. The Learning Concierge (Learning Advisor) is a really unique component of the course. They’re a human, not a bot, with professional skills and training to deliver careers coaching, as well as being an integral part of the team that designs and delivers the studios. The Master of Technology and Master of Professional Practice represent a turning point for postgraduate education, giving students the opportunity to create a truly tailored qualification. With micro credential, graduate certificate and graduate diploma options available alongside the master’s, participants can choose to start small and expand their learning if and when life and work allows. And when they do, there’s a team to guide them. For Lloyd, the courses are a partnership not only with a range of industry organisations, but also with some of UTS’s most talented researchers and educational designers. These include Associate Professor Julia Prior, who recently won a National Teaching and Learning Citation, and who was also part of the original design team for UTS’s highly successful Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation; transdisciplinary practitioner and sustainability expert Associate Professor Dena Fam, who codesigned the UTS award winning Transdisciplinary Living Lab model ; and Associate Professor Ann Reich and Dr Donna Rooney, who are part of a team that that developed the award winning Capability Wrap process used in the UTS Master of Education (Learning & Leadership). This Capability Wrap process will be among the defining features of both degrees. UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands. We would also like to pay respect to the Elders both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for these lands.

Governments and NGOs design and deliver various programs across many realms including education, health and justice. Financial organisations assess eligibility for loans and help customers to navigate financial decisions. A fundamental tasks for all such organisations is to determine what impact their programs and policies have on the people they serve. This task is known as ‘Program Impact Evaluation’. Given the crucial importance of such evaluations, as well as the steadily increasing industry demand for professionals with the skills to conduct such evaluations, our expert academics working within the Economics Discipline Group of the UTS Business School have developed our very first ‘Impact Evaluation Methods’ short course. The course covers the most important contemporary econometric evaluation techniques, without focusing on technical details. It emphasises hands-on application rather than theory, and covers essential topics and skills, such as randomised experiments, regression, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity designs, and differences-in-differences methods, as well as related methods. Enrol to build your capability in conducting more effective assessment and comparison of impacts achieved through the programs and policies of your organisation, ensuring that funding and efforts are allocated to where they will achieve the greatest impact.

INTRODUCTION TO IMPACT EVALUATION METHODS This module covers: 2. INTRODUCTION TO STATA Stata is the leading econometric software package. It is the package of choice for most impact evaluation practitioners. This module covers: 3. INTRODUCTION TO REGRESSION ANALYSIS Whilst not strictly necessary, regression is a fundamental tool for most impact evaluations. This module introduces participants to the intuition and anatomy of regression. Participants will learn to run basic regressions in Stata, to interpret the output, and to visualise the results. 4. RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTs OR EXPERIMENTS) This module covers: 5. PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WITH RCTs This module covers: 6. INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE (IV) REGRESSION IV Regression has a long and rich history and has many applications. It is a key technique for causal inference in its own right. It is also a key tool for implementing all of the quasi-experimental techniques. Whilst IV can be confusing, this module will show that its essence is straightforward. Participants will learn how IV can also be used to analyse the results of RCTs. The module will also introduce participants to the ‘local average treatment effect’ and ‘external validity’. 7. REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGN (RDD) Experiments are not always feasible or practical. But sometimes quasi-experimental techniques can be almost as powerful. RDD is a quasi-experimental technique that has emerged in recent years as the ‘Silver Standard’ of causal inference - the closest cousin of RCTs. A single graph is usually enough for a good RDD to be convincing. Participants will learn about the intuition and power of RDD, and will implement RDD in the Stata environment, both graphically and through regression analysis. 8. DIFFERENCES-IN-DIFFERENCES (DiD) & RELATED TECHNIQUES DiD is the most commonly used quasi-experimental technique. Like other quasi-experimental techniques, DiD seeks to mimic RCTs. In DiD, treated groups and comparison groups are followed over time. Participants will implement and interpret DiD regressions in the Stata environment. Participants will also be introduced to Panel Data, as well as the synthetic control method. Professor Peter Siminski | Professor, Economics Discipline Group One of Australia’s leading applied microeconomists, Peter has led the Impact Evaluation Methods course design and will contribute to its delivery. He has previously used all of the techniques covered in the course in his own research and has been teaching the techniques to undergraduate and postgraduate students since 2009. Much of his research has applied modern impact evaluation techniques to study the causal effects of Australian government policies and programs on people’s lives. Peter has published in leading journals such as the American Economic Review, AEJ: Applied Economics and The Review of Economics and Statistics.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/orthoptics-courses/orthoptics-student-profiles/nikita-nandoskar,"I was born and raised in Sydney and I have not yet found a more perfect balance of beach, bushland and brunch! While growing up my interests shifted between dancing, painting, swimming and archery – yet my love for health science remained strong. While completing my Bachelor’s degree in Medical Sciences, I also worked in hospitality, retail and accounting, which helped me understand my passion for working with people. It was not until I became a volunteer at St John Ambulance Service that I knew my interests and skills could be combined into a career. I have always had an interest in human vision and its intricacies and wanted to work in a field that could constantly teach me new things. I also enjoy meeting new people and have a passion for increasing access to health services for disadvantaged communities. I believe patient education is a critical part of the treatment process and being able to encourage people to take initiative with their own eye health is extremely rewarding. It is crazy to see how many people think glasses are the only solution to improving vision and I’d love to play a role in clearing this misconception. I wanted to refine my clinical skills and enter a field of expertise where I could treat and educate patients about topics I found interesting. After conducting some research and getting in touch with current clinicians, I discovered that Orthoptics could offer me opportunities for one on one patient interactions, job satisfaction and the flexibility to grow and travel within an evolving field. UTS is focussed on developing future industry leaders and being a young university, their passion for including the latest eye health research into our course work was inspiring and exciting. The university emphasises the importance of evidence-based learning and understands the value of hands-on experience. By far the most rewarding aspect of my course was the opportunity to travel to Darwin for placement. UTS allowed me to delve into my interests by conducting a 4-week placement at Royal Darwin Hospital. I was exposed to rare and interesting ocular cases, given a unique perspective on the impact of COVID-19 and encouraged to feel a part of the Ophthalmic team! I hope to enter the hospital setting and contribute towards bridging the gap in rural Australian eye health care. This would also allow me to work with leading eye specialists, increase the exposure of our niche field and constantly challenge me to improve my skills. Our clinicians offer a unique expertise and so I would like to encourage health professionals to consider our role in patient management. The course is goal-orientated and provides a strong platform for you to enter the workforce. There is a large variety of opportunities within the profession and a growing demand for our skills in this digital era. My name is Nikita and I'm studying the Master of Orthoptics at UTS. I grew up in Sydney and I've always had an interest in science. I studied all the way through high school and I did my undergraduate in medical science. So I've always had a passion for that field. My understanding of Orthoptics was that it's a form of eye therapy. And since doing the course, I've learned that the field's much broader than that, and they deal with pre and post-operative care and lots of diagnostic roles as well. The role is also expanded to treating pathological conditions in eyecare. Orthoptics has been a really exciting experience. The profession allows me to merge my two interests in science and patient care. I get to work with the patients one-on-one and it's a really good field for me to be able to give back to the community, through helping people. My interest in Orthoptics first sparked when my brother was receiving treatment as a child, as I continued the course, it was really interesting to see how the pathology behind his condition and how we treat children is through games and through fun activities but it's actually a way to maintain the child's vision. The master of orthoptics is a two year postgraduate course. They combine your theoretical classes with placement while you're completing the course. So it's a really good way to apply what you're learning in the classroom into the field almost immediately. I am passionate about rural and remote patient care. I had the opportunity recently to go to Royal Darwin hospital for placement. And in the month that I was there, we were able to treat patients as if we were clinicians and supported by the entire hospital staff. And it was a really wonderful opportunity to see conditions that you wouldn't necessarily see in a metropolitan setting like Sydney. The job prospects for orthoptics range, from research to working in private clinics or in public hospitals and for Orthoptists at the moment with an ageing population, there's an increasing demand for us in the field. My advice to students, if they have an interest in patient care and an interest in science, this is a beautiful way to merge those two industries and, uh, definitely apply.

Take advantage of our flexible online learning environment to balance the demands of study and work. - I really enjoy the aspect of quantitative finance because it fuses mathematics from the physical sciences in a commercial setting. - It lies on an intersection of three disciplines: mathematics, finance, and programming, and I'm kind of interested in all of them at the same time. Does this thing really exist? Yes, it exists. It's calledquantitative finance. - Now, I wanted to do something which involved maths,and coding, and finance, and UTS has just that exact combination. - So we're very proud of ourMaster of Quantitative Finance because it's actually quitedistinct from a lot of degrees. All the subjects in our main Master ofQuantitative Finance curriculum are taught only tostudents in that degree. We can actually use the mathematics at an appropriate levelof sophistications, rather than catering to a muchbroader class of students, which perhaps don'thave all the preparation that is necessary. - The subjects were very relevant to what the industry looks for in a quant, particularly in modelvalidation, model development, pricing libraries. The languages which UTS teachesin terms of C++, VBA, Excel, those are exactly whatthe industry is asking. - The Master of Quantitative Finance is now nearly 20 years old, but that doesn't mean that we're still teachingthe same subjects in the same way that wewere teaching 20 years ago. One of the important changes that came in were the various valuationadjustments, the so-called XVAs, that were introduced in the industry. They are now covered in the subject. More recently, of course, machinelearning, neural networks, and the like have becomevery important tools in many areas of application. And we are applyingmachine learning techniques to quantitative financeproblems in this degree. - The preparation that UTS gave us in terms of the industryrequirements was just awesome. They provided notes, they gave us a lot ofguidance during class, the assignments were really useful. - The quality of teachingat UTS is very high. Being associated with theQuant Finance Research Centre has well meant that wehad dedicated professors that really knew their subject matter and were really approachable. And you really get dedicated time with tutors and your professors, and that helps with growing and learning. - Traditionally, you'd expect them to become quant analysts in a bank, but the areas of potential careers are actually much broader than that. We've had people go to fundmanagers, including hedge funds, work for the bank regulator,or also for large corporates. - I love mathematics so much. I just wanna use it moreand more and apply it. - It's a rewarding career. You are in markets, you're dealing with bigdeals and big transactions. - The Australian FinancialReview's BOSS Magazine did a ranking in variousbusiness disciplines. And in quantitative finance, our university, UTS, wasranked first in Australia and second in the world. - It's heaven or someonewho loves maths, and coding, and finance, and someonewho wants to become a quant.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/speech-pathology-courses/speech-pathology-student-profiles/marina-samaan,"Tell us about yourself! I graduated with a Bachelor of Speech, Hearing and Language Science in 2018. In high school, my younger cousin had been seeing a Speech Pathologist and I went to an appointment with him. I remember thinking, “What they do is amazing, it must be so rewarding!” That was my first real introduction to Speech Pathology. I got a taste for both Speech Pathology and Audiology during my undergraduate studies, and after graduating, I had to choose between the two career paths. I know I made the right choice choosing speech pathology, especially after going on my clinical placements. Speech pathology is the perfect fit for me. I’m so fortunate! Why did you choose to study at UTS? I chose to study my Master of Speech Pathology at UTS because the course was brand new – there were subjects that other universities don’t offer, and everything at UTS is up-to-date. For me, one of the standout aspects was UTS integrated technology throughout the course, for example the use of telehealth. Everyone is using this technology now, and we’re among the first to have a clinical placement entirely focused on telehealth. My cohort are like a little family. We have great interactions and relationships with the wonderful staff, they’re amazing. I am honoured to learn from such experienced academics. Anyone in my cohort would tell you that it’s been such an remarkable journey for all of us. I can’t brag enough about my colleagues, I’ve made relationships that will last a lifetime. I am very grateful for them, we’re all very supportive of each other. I really look forward to seeing how well everyone does once we graduate! What is the most rewarding aspect of the course? Learning in a safe workplace environment has been a highlight for me. On my first placement, my goals were at a novice level. It was all about me, and how I could could improve my abilities, but then it slowly shifted. Now that I’m more confident and have some clinical experience, my sessions are tailored to better suit the needs of the client. I love communicating and I love helping people. I really enjoy the counselling aspect of Speech Pathology. I love helping people to communicate and enabling them to achieve their goals. What do you hope to achieve in the future? In the near future, I would love to work with children with communication disabilities. The overall course was tailored to a diverse client population providing me with many learning opportunities. Hence, I am open to the possibilities that I may work with a different populations in the future. What advice do you have for students who are considering the Master of Speech Pathology? If you enjoy problem solving, technology, communicating and helping people – studying a Master of Speech Pathology is such a fulfilling and rewarding choice. Take the leap. You’ll love it! My name is Marina, and I'm studying a Master of Speech Pathology at UTS. I did my Bachelor's in Speech, Hearing and Language Sciences so I did have a bit of a background of what a Speech Pathologist did. I knew that a speech pathologist works with children and adults with speech and language difficulties, as well as a stutter and swallowing difficulties. But throughout the course, it's changed in terms of our scope of practice. So we work with adults with acquired disorders like TBI, aphasia, stroke, you know, cognitive communication disorders. It's across the lifespan as well for people with cerebral palsy, autism, down syndrome, intellectual disorders. I was inspired by my first ever interaction with a speech pathologist. One of my cousins was attending speech pathology services. I was amazed by what they did. I just thought it was so rewarding. So I was like, this might be it. And I love talking. So it was like, it's a perfect fit for me. So I chose to study at UTS because everything in terms of our course units were up to date. I think the main thing for me was that they were integrating technology. So I was just like, this is the future. So I'd like to be a part of it. The Master of Speech Pathology at UTS is a two year degree that's been accredited by Speech Pathology Australia. It's an innovative course where you have flipped classrooms so you do some work in the background and then you use that knowledge that you've learnt in your home practice in your classrooms. We have these amazing world-renowned speech pathologists and psychologists and we've learnt such a vast variety of knowledge from them. The most rewarding thing about the course was just being able to watch people grow and achieve their goals. I've been very fortunate to have a wide range of clinical placements, private pediatrics, government funded pediatrics. I've worked at a hospital, I've worked with disabilities. They really prepare you for what it's going to be like in the workforce. A speech pathologist can work in hospitals, they work in clinics, community health centres. My advice for students that are considering a Masters of Speech Pathology is do it.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/genetic-counselling-courses,"Alison McEwen: UTS and the Graduate School of Health recognised that genetic counseling is a growth area at the moment and that's really because genomic technology is meaning that we have increasing access to more and more genetic and genomic information. Chris Jacobs: It is a time of huge change for Genetic Counselling, it's a time of huge change for health care and the huge impact that genomics and genetics are going to make for people in terms of understanding disease, treating disease and preventing disease. Alison McEwen: Quite a few things make this program different from other genetic counselling programs. I really felt that it was really important that we had a course that was accessible and so because of that we're offering this program in our blended mode utilising zoom to have an online classroom. Chris Jacobs: Teaching students online is very engaging and it's almost like having everybody in the front row because you can see everybody, everybody's engaged, everybody's participating and you very quickly, once you start teaching online, you forget that you're online. Alison McEwen: It's really an exciting environment. It's just like being in a physical classroom except that we're on a screen. Gabrielle Flemin: It's just been a really good fit for me personally with the self directed learning I'm really able to take advantage of my time. Courtney Katrina: It's also an interesting way of learning because we get through the material first and then we can go over the main points. Erin Turbitt: UTS is the best place to study Genetic Counselling because the academic staff bring a variety of different experiences and knowledge and have worked with world leaders in Genetic Counselling, education and research. Megan Williams: Girra Maa works with genetic counselling to ensure that indigenous ways of knowing and being and doing are woven into every element of the coursework as possible. Because genetic counselling is taught online, I could be doing teaching while I was out on the country of my ancestors and students wouldn't get that experience to hear from me what that means if we weren't in that online environment. Alison McEwen: International students can come and study and we really welcome applications and interest from students, particularly I guess from countries where genetic counseling is developing. Maggie Law: We don't have a master of Genetic Counselling in Hong Kong. We only have the Palmer course for Genetic Counselling. If I want to study master of Genetic Counselling, the most closest place to study is Australia. Alison McEwen: Graduates of the UTS master of Genetic Counselling will be extremely competent counsellors and really able to go out there and work alongside and empower clients and families as they come to learn about genetic and genomic information in their families. Chris Jacobs: There are lots of jobs around at the moment for genetic counsellors because there was an expansion of genetics and genomic testing, so there are more and more people wanting genetic counsellors, but I think there's gotta be lots of new roles that emerge over the next year and a half that we don't even know exist yet. Join us in 2024 Applications openAugust 2023 Info session Course guide (PDF) Enquire now The Discipline of Genetic Counselling offers the following programs: Uniquely in Australasia, the Master of Genetic Counselling sits alongside other allied health disciplines in the Graduate School of Health, offering opportunities for inter-professional training and research.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/law/courses/undergraduate-law/course-experience/undergraduate-profiles/katherine-agapitos,"What led you to choose UTS:Law for your studies? From the outset I was always interested in UTS as a university. UTS:Law’s PLT program was one of the outstanding features of the degree as it was encompassed within the 5 years of a combined degree at the time of my enrolment in 2010. Further the combined degree itself has prided itself on its flexibility and focus on students building practical legal skills from the commencement of their degree in order to produce well rounded graduates. If you are working while you are studying, what does your job involve? For the past four years I have been a paralegal in the Workplace Practice Group of a large commercial law firm. This has been an invaluable experience as I have been able to build practical skills whilst undertaking my studies. Being a paralegal is definitely an experience I would recommend all law students take advantage of where they have an opportunity to. As a paralegal some of the roles and responsibilities include: How do you balance study and work commitments? Balancing work and university commitments was difficult at first but enabled me to become very efficient with managing time. Throughout my degree I also balanced work and university with my involvement in the UTS Law Students’ Society. This meant that I did not have much time to waste and procrastinate and I learnt how to maximize my time with all of these activities. Developing effective time management skills has played a significant role in how I approach and prioritise tasks in the workforce. How have/will your studies at UTS contributed to your career? Undertaking a combined law degree at UTS has played a significant role in my ability to practice as a lawyer as there has been a strong practical component encompassed in the majority of subjects which makes it very unique when comparing to many other law schools in Sydney and New South Wales. These skills have been significantly transferable in the workplace which is constantly identified by employers. How have they informed the way you work? In the course of the degree, there has been a strong focus on ensuring that students are equipped with the skills to be reflective practitioners. The graduate attributes that underpin each of the courses have resonated when approaching tasks in my final year of law school as well as in my role as a paralegal. I found from my experience in the workforce, that the graduate attributes that are developed at university flourish once you commence practical work experience. What is the most rewarding aspect of your degree? Why? The most rewarding part had been having such a strong involvement in the UTS Law Students' Society over the past four years and becoming the President of the Society in 2013. It was a fulfilling experience to have contributed to the student body and Faculty throughout the duration of my degree and enabled me to build networks that will be incredibly significant in my career. The continuous contribution was rewarded by the receipt of the Dean's Special Award which formally acknowledges a major individual contribution by a student, in terms of time and effort, to the general work of the Faculty and, in particular, to student and staff relations at the UTS:Law Awards Ceremony. Another rewarding aspect was achieving the Brennan Justice and Leadership Award and being presented by the former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Gerrard Brennan. These remarkable moments were certainly the pinnacle of my degree and experience at UTS. What would your advice be for someone who is looking at studying Law at UTS? My advice would be to take advantage of all of the opportunities outside the classroom that are provided by the UTS:Law Faculty and the UTS Law Students’ Society. Taking part in initiatives such as the Brennan Justice and Leadership Program are invaluable with respect to forming a well-rounded education at law school. Competitions such as negotiation, client interview, witness examination and mooting are phenomenal initiatives that can assist students in building practical skills to enhance the knowledge built within the classroom, enabling them to attain advocacy and client based skills before commencing their PLT or entering the workforce. Is there anything else you’d like to add about your experience at UTS:Law, or the University as a whole? Law school is demanding both academically and physically, so it’s vital that you all take care of yourselves during the process. Maintaining a work/study-life balance is crucial. Whether you are undertaking your legal studies at UTS as a Juris Doctor (JD), a Post-Graduate or an Undergraduate student, your time at law school will be one of the most challenging, yet one of the most rewarding experiences of your life. My advice would be to get involved at university outside of the class room. Whether it is with the Law Students’ Society or other sporting or social clubs, it is vital that you make the most of the opportunity to have a complete university experience. UTS acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Boorooberongal people of the Dharug Nation, the Bidiagal people and the Gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands.

https://www.uts.edu.au/human-technology-institute/projects/strategic-ai-courses-legal-sector,"HTI offers world-leading training on AI for Australian legal professionals. We help build critical competencies in governance and regulatory risk analysis, supporting lawyers and their clients to seize the opportunities related to developing, procuring and implementing AI systems. Australia faces a critical AI skills gap. Work is underway to build Australia’s technical skills in data science and STEM. However, there remains an urgent need to build strategic expertise in AI. Without the latter, we risk powerful AI tools causing adverse impacts, ranging from inaccurate predictions to system inefficiencies, to unfair discrimination. When it comes to AI and the law, we know that there is a sector-wide need for legal professionals to upskill. The 2017 Future of Law and Innovation in the Profession report made 19 recommendations about how the profession needs to adapt to technological change – but we are still some way from the profession rising to meet the opportunities and challenges posed by AI. HTI’s training for the legal profession is designed to help bridge the gap between where we are now, and where we want to be. In partnership with LexisNexis, HTI’s Skills Lab is offering courses to address these critical skills gaps within the legal profession - whether using AI within your legal practice; advising organisations on the procurement, use, or development of AI; or supporting clients who have been impacted by AI. Growing legal professionals’ expertise in these areas will be vital to ensuring that AI is developed, procured, and implemented to meet our community’s needs. Customised leadership workshops for senior lawyers These leadership workshops build understanding of the strategic risks and opportunities related to AI for senior lawyers and executives responsible for the stewardship of law firms, government legal practices and in-house legal departments. These workshops offer leadership development for senior lawyers and focus on: - governance and regulatory risks and opportunities - applying a sound ethical approach to maintain a strong reputation - strategic intent and path to scale - workforce transformation and adaptation Customised leadership workshops for senior lawyers are face to face and run for half to one day and have a maximum of 15 attendees. Masterclasses for lawyers engaging directly with new technology Lawyers specialising in the use of AI and related new technologies need a more sophisticated understanding about AI, its risks and opportunities. These masterclasses help to build skills to effectively guide the development, procurement and implementation of AI-powered systems. These masterclasses are particularly useful to lawyers who advise clients in sectors where AI growth is high, such as financial services and insurance, taxation and infrastructure. Too often AI systems fail to meet their aims, especially in the fairness and accuracy of AI-informed decisions. This creates regulatory, trust and economic risks. These masterclasses include: - introductory information regarding the operation and possible failure points of AI - how to identify and address legal and reputational risks typically arising in systems that use AI use of obligations registers - the ‘lifecycle’ of AI. Masterclasses for lawyers engaging directly with new technology run face to face for approximately 6 weeks with 2-hour weekly sessions. Classes have a maximum of 20 people. Training on AI fundamentals for all lawyers All legal professionals need a core understanding of the legal implications of AI. This training is useful throughout the legal profession, at all levels of legal experience. The training covers areas including: - an overview of how AI operates - key causes of AI system failure - key considerations that must be taken into account when designing, procuring or deploying an AI system Training on AI fundamentals for all lawyers courses are entirely online and can be undertaken in the student’s own time. AI is not well understood in Australia – including by senior decision makers in government, by executives in the private sector, and by many legal professionals who provide critical advice around AI development and use. This has created significant risks. For instance, Australia’s automated social security debt-recovery system (known as ‘Robodebt’) is emblematic of the dangers associated with AI and automation. Artificial intelligence is powering a multi-trillion-dollar transformation for Australia’s economy. The exponential growth in AI is reshaping our world. This technological revolution brings significant economic and other opportunities, but it also threatens serious harm, including to our privacy, right to equality, and other basic rights. We must upskill legal professionals across the board to ensure that Australians enjoys the benefits of AI while avoiding the harms.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/speech-pathology-courses/speech-pathology-student-profiles/susannah-challita,"I am currently working as a paediatric speech pathologist and I am dedicated to supporting children and their families in their communication journey. I believe that empathy and patience are essential traits to have as a speech pathologist as well as the willingness to continuously learn. I am passionate about making a difference to the lives of others including children with communication difficulties and their families. I am passionate about assisting children in achieving their full potential. I love meeting new people, connecting with others and learning about their lives and backgrounds. I have always been someone who has looked out for others and always wanting to help people in need. I love empowering others and helping them to see the positive factors and lessons in all situations. I chose this degree as it has always been an essential aspect of my career journey. I was inspired by my first interaction with a speech pathologist that I had met when my grandmother had a stroke and was hospitalised. I have always been passionate about helping others and forming strong connections and relationships with many different people. I knew I wanted to pursue a career that would be rewarding and motivating. I chose to study at UTS as I had heard from many people that they had enjoyed their experiences at the university. I had also completed my own research at the time I was applying for a postgraduate course in speech pathology and loved that the UTS Graduate School of Health was growing. I was quite intrigued by the course description and loved that there were countless opportunities to put theory into practice including simulated environments and workshops. I also loved the integration of technology as it is growing exponentially. I was learning all about the discipline of speech pathology including who speech pathologists work with and the variety of environments they work in. I learned about the range of communication and swallowing difficulties that people can present with that can be related to a range of health conditions and disabilities. I was learning about the various areas of speech pathology including speech, language, voice, stuttering, multimodal communication and swallowing and how speech pathologists can improve people's lives. The most rewarding aspect of the course was being able to connect with others who share a common goal of wanting to help and support others. I felt extremely supported by others in the course including the lecturers. Making time for your personal/social life is important when completing a postgrad course. Time management was a crucial aspect to maintaining a healthy balance. I tried not to procrastinate in completing tasks for the course including study and assessments. I used a diary to plan my days and organised my time well. I divided the times in my day into study and other commitments. I remembered to schedule in my down time and kept on top of my physical and mental health by exercising, sleeping well, going for regular walks and spending time with family and friends. Despite not being able to have much face to face contact in my last year of study, I did enjoy the online mode of learning. Studying from home was quite convenient in terms of having more time to do other things such as an increased amount of personal commitments. I was able to adapt quickly to the new situation. It allowed me to learn from a comfortable space and we were still able to engage in smaller group discussions during most of our lectures. I am currently working in a private practice in Sandringham and Ramsgate Beach. The clinic provides occupational therapy and speech therapy services to children aged 0-18 years. Over the past year, as a new graduate speech pathology I have used much of my acquired knowledge from my postgrad course. I feel that the various opportunities for practical applications and the range of experiences and clinical placements I undertook have provided me with the clinical confidence I have had in my current workplace. During placements, I experienced working with children in a range of settings including private clinics, hospitals, community health settings and delivering telehealth therapy. I experienced working with children and adults that have speech, language, literacy, fluency and swallowing difficulties as well as children and adults who require alternative modes of communication. I hope to attain a leadership role in my workplace and become a mentor and supervisor to new graduate speech pathologists as well as a clinical educator for speech pathology students. My advice is that if you are a person who is looking for a rewarding, enjoyable and evolving career then this is the course for you. It is an extraordinary and rewarding course and you will definitely feel that you have achieved a huge accomplishment at the end. Embrace everything the course has to offer and be prepared for an unforgettable journey.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/engineering/courses/electrical-and-data-science-engineering-majors/meet-dhruv-electrical-engineering-student,"Electricity powers the world around us and is core to the future of engineering and technology. Taking inspiration from a Year 9 Electrical elective, Dhruv chose to major in Electrical Engineering to future-proof his career opportunities through practical and hands-on learning and contribute to our changing world. Dhruv’s journey to engineering was ignited by his curiosity to this field at a young age. “My dad is an engineer. I was always interested to learn what he did at work”. Whilst he was certain about studying engineering, Dhruv was unsure about which major he would pursue. However, Dhruv recalled studying an electrical subject in Year 9 as an elective. “I really enjoyed that subject and its practical element such as making circuits, and I was really looking for that hands-on approach to study when considering my major”. Dhruv also felt that Electrical Engineering was a future-focused major and would set him up for success. ""Technology moves at such a rapid pace, but electricity is always at centre of technology and powers the world around us. It is crucial to so many elements of our society, and I felt Electrical Engineering would also give me a variety of career opportunities to explore in the future.” Dhruv also decided to study a business management degree together with his engineering degree with the hope that he would be set up for a future in management. He believed that the dual-degree approach would enhance his skill set preparing him for various roles in the future. Engineering Undergraduate Courses Guide (PDF, 7.2MB) When choosing UTS for his Electronic Engineering major, Dhruv was drawn to the hands-on and practical approach on campus. “I like being challenged to think differently, and I get the freedom to do that in my engineering subjects. We also get access to some great facilities like the UTS Robotics Institute where I get to experience real-life working equipment that I wouldn’t get anywhere else”. In 2nd year, Dhruv worked with other engineering students for the UTS Rover Team project that saw him design rovers to be launched on the moon. “It was so cool to be a part of something space-related that combined so well with my degree. We got to use some really high-end equipment that I would have otherwise not had the chance to experience”. In his third year, Dhruv joined the UTS Aerospace Society where he took part in the Spaghetti and Space launch project that involved building a high altitude balloon that travelled 25kms into space with a plate of spaghetti. “It was such a great project and received so much attention across Australia. It felt like a fever dream!”. Having taken part in these experiences, Dhruv believes they have helped complement his skills learnt within his studies and explore different facets of engineering. I really love UTS’ hands-on and collaborative approach to learning. It makes so much sense, especially during excursions or when working on practical projects through the students’ clubs and societies. ""I also appreciate the university’s willingness to employ students on campus through the Student Promotional Representatives (SPROUT) program which I am a part of where we can inspire other potential students to study degrees like Electrical Engineering that they may not have considered.” As a part of his Electrical Engineering major, Dhruv has had the chance to gain industry exposure and make connections through internships. “I am interning for Alstom, who work closely on the Sydney Light Rail and Sydney Metro projects. I am specifically working on the Sydney Trains project”. Working with a close team of experienced Engineers, Dhruv has received practical experience and is able to contribute to real-world projects that keep the Sydney rail network running. ""I have physically contributed to the traction maintenance of the Millenium fleet commissioned in the early 2000s working with a close team of experienced engineers. I’m involved in the repairs and get the chance to work on projects that are meaningful. Dhruv believes that engineering enthusiasts should explore their passion, and not be afraid to explore their options. It’s a common misconception that Electrical Engineering is very difficult and math-heavy. Don’t just rule out a major because you’ve heard that it’s difficult. If you have a passion for it and are looking for solid graduate opportunities and a community to be a part of, Electrical Engineering is a great major to pursue. Dhruv attributes his academic journey’s success to his ability to be involved in extracurricular projects. “I would say be as productive and proactive as possible in your degree. Try as many things as possible and find your niche”. The Electrical Engineering major is offered to undergraduate students and can be paired with an Engineering degree.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/genetic-counselling-courses/genetic-counselling-student-profiles/emma-celis-rivas,"Tell us about yourself! I studied a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Genetics and Pharmacology at the University of Western Australia. I finished my undergraduate degree with a love for genetics, but I was unsure what I wanted to do with my future. I didn’t have a deep love for the lab, preferring people and conversation. I pursued work in the pharmacology field and worked in biotechnology research then pharmaceuticals but found myself yearning for personal connection and a desire to make a difference in people’s lives. It wasn’t until speaking with a friend that I was introduced to genetic counselling. She has a daughter affected by a genetic condition. Hearing her journey as a mother and what the genetic counsellor did for her and her family really resonated with me. The first thing I Googled was Genetic Counselling courses in Australia. That was in January of 2009, and at that point, my only options were to move interstate. Based on my situation at the time with my partner, and work and living situation, it was just never an option to pack up and move interstate to pursue it. It remained in the back of my mind. In the meantime, I became a mother and had two children. I pursued volunteer opportunities that resonated with me, and I ended up becoming a volunteer Breastfeeding Counsellor through the Australian Breastfeeding Association. I went through counselling training and volunteer work, which I knew would serve me well for an application in the future, if a course became available! Why did you choose UTS? I had waited 10 years for this dream career, but I refused to give up! In 2019, something made me Google genetic counselling courses again and I found out the UTS had developed a course that was delivered with a hybrid of online and on-campus blocks. I joined the online information session, learnt more about the course and realised that this could actually be possible for me – living in Perth – to complete this course. How has your experience been? Do you have any highlights? My first placement was unfortunately cancelled due to COVID-19. In response, the course coordinators created a fantastic virtual clinical placement, designed to give us a taste of placement via Zoom. They had other students, members of the academic team, and members of the genetic counselling community acting in the role of clients. It allowed us to participate in multidisciplinary team meetings, respond to phone messages left by clinicians, talk to a wide range of clients about what was going on for them and reflect on these experiences in small groups. Placements have been like putting the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle together and seeing the bigger picture. I’m recognising how many skills we’ve learnt in our course so far and seeing how it all actually works in practice. For example, I now understand why we had a workshop on interpreting a pathology report, because now I’m seeing pathology reports every day! It’s rewarding and also a privilege talking with people about their journey and hearing their stories. We have students across most states of Australia and New Zealand. Since the course is mostly virtual, sometimes the time difference can be challenging with group assignments with students spread across multiple time zones. However, I love that I can study from home and balance my hours around my family commitments. Although we are spread out, supportive and close connections have been built within the small cohort and we all help each other out and communicate frequently. In terms of clinical skills, we have so many people involved in the course, and each one of them brings something special and unique. We have doctors that talk to us, we have guest speakers, and we hear from patients or people living with genetic conditions. There’s been a lot of thought put into who presents content to us, and I’m constantly blown away by the level of expertise, the stories that they have to share, and the fact that the Genetic Counselling team have managed to find these people to talk to us. What do you hope to achieve in the future? Ideally, I would like to work as a genetic counsellor within the genetic services here in Western Australia. The course has also been really good at identifying new and emerging roles for us with our skills, and I’m aware that there may be opportunities in research with clinical trials or with laboratories as well. Do you have any advice for future students? Getting experience talking with people is so important; whether it’s in a volunteer role or a workplace, feeling comfortable talking to people about potentially challenging things. If you’re an older student or a parent, go for it, because the life experience you can bring to the course is a really wonderful thing.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/speech-pathology-courses/speech-pathology-student-profiles/jacob-decates,"My favourite things in life are being outside amongst nature, playing and watching sport and being with family, especially my three nieces. Unfortunately, the relationship with my eldest niece is deteriorating, as I have stopped letting her beat me at FIFA and she is still winning. Professionally, I get the most satisfaction from helping people overcome a problem. My undergraduate degree was in Psychology which has been incredibly helpful in my work – working in customer-facing roles and training staff positively and effectively. I love to help the people around me. Whether this is family, friends, or the people I work with. If I can leave a situation feeling like I contributed in some small way, that is my ultimate satisfaction. Whether that is a conversation with a friend, hosting a trivia night during lockdown for the university cohort or by meeting, getting to know and help clients on placement. I had never heard of speech pathology. All I knew about it was that it could be useful to help royalty make public addresses. Then, one day, I met a speech pathologist. We talked about what we did and the more they told me about speech pathology, the more I felt that it was something worth investigating. During my psychology degree, I had loved learning about social communication, cognition of language and neuroanatomy. The more I learnt about speech pathology, the more I realised that I could take these areas of interest and combine them with my other passion – helping people. I researched all the Master of Speech Pathology programs offered by the various universities and made a list of pros and cons for each one. I liked the sound of the UTS program, as they appeared to embrace modern ideas. Having a personal interest in technology, I appreciated the modern technological approach UTS took. They have a unit of study dedicated to the use of social media engagement and they have a room dedicated to virtual and augmented reality. At a postgraduate information evening, I spoke to Rebecca Smith, a PhD candidate who was researching 3D printed food. I saw that this university put technology in the University of Technology Sydney. Their modern approach told to me that this would not only be a current course, but also one that would prepare me for an evolving future. The theory of speech pathology is interesting and always engaging. However, taking new skills out on placements is the most rewarding. It has been a pleasure to break down that knowledge and rebuild it to fit your client. Seeing a client learn from and demonstrate skills that you taught them is an extraordinary feeling. Of course, it’s not why you do it, but receiving the feedback that you have been a personal help to them is the cherry on top. Hearing that I have helped clients feel more control over a stutter or helped them adjust to life after a traumatic injury is the most rewarding aspect of this course. My experience has been three out of four semesters online, and five out of six placements had telehealth. However, I don’t feel that this has impacted my education at all. In fact, in my last placement, I was asked to present my telehealth experiences as a student, as student telehealth placements is still a new experience for some locations. I found that keeping a set schedule for myself to be extra important for online learning. Scheduling regular exercise, getting outside, seeing family (in-person or via zoom). Intentionally and mindfully stepping away from the computer at a certain time has been the best way for me to avoid ‘Zoom fatigue’. Most of these strategies I learnt at uni from our Head of Discipline, Bronwyn Hemsley. In the future, I hope to secure a position working with adult clients in a hospital setting, particularly clients with acquired brain injuries. It is a fascinating area where the research base is continuing to develop. I also hope that I will be able to contribute to this research one day, therefore contributing at an individual and a population level. My advice for students considering this course: speech pathology is so much more than speech. If you like communication, anatomy, working with kids, improving the quality of life for others: speech pathology can take you there. I came into this course with a strong idea of the direction I would head in when I finish. Since then, I have changed my mind more times than I can count on one hand. If you think that you might be interested in this course, then odds are there is something here that will capture your attention. Communication is something that is vital for everyone across the lifespan and something that can sky-rocket quality of life when improved. Studying speech pathology has opened many more doors than I ever thought it would. Learn more about the Master of Speech Pathology at UTS.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/law/courses/undergraduate-law/course-experience/undergraduate-profiles/robert-guzowski,"Which high school did you attend? St Ignatius College, Riverview. Which degree are you studying? What year are you in? Third year Bachelor of Laws/Bachelor of Science (Biotechnology). What led you to choose UTS for your studies in Law? Several factors led me to choose UTS, but the clincher was that UTS allowed me to combine the study of law with a really interesting and promising field of science – biotechnology. What influenced your decision? Both of my elder brothers are alumni of UTS – albeit from the Business School – so my family was a big influencing factor in deciding to come here. How have your studies at UTS helped you in finding a career path? Interaction with lecturers and other students at uni actually led to my current employment at the university, so my studies at UTS have definitely helped me in starting my career. That said, I’m certain that my career ‘path’ is far from straight or settled! Are you working while studying? If so, how do you manage the competing demands of university and work? I’ve currently got two jobs at UTS, and I recently left a third job outside of uni in preparation for the exam period. All of these jobs are on a casual basis, which is really the only possibility for me because of the long hours of labs and practicals involved in doing a science degree. However, I’m living proof that juggling study and some kind of financial independence is possible. How has your learning experience at UTS prepared you for your career? Studying at UTS is great because of the practical focus of the teaching. However, I think what has helped even more are the events run by the student societies here at UTS: the information nights and clerkship talks (organised by the Law Students’ Society) and the networking sessions (organised by the Medical Bioscience Body of Students) have really given me an insight into what a career in these fields may hold. What sets UTS students apart in your field? UTS:Law students are set apart from other law graduates in that they can elect to complete Practical Legal Training – a certification program administered by the College of Law – as part of their course at UTS. This, combined with the hands-on, practical focus of the teaching across the entire university, produces graduates, especially law graduates, who truly are workforce-ready. What is the most rewarding aspect of your degree? Why? I think the reason I choose my degree is because I wanted to make a difference – I’m just a doe-eyed idealist at heart. And studying at UTS has really allowed me to act on my desire to help others through some of the co-curricular activities available: the BUiLD (Beyond UTS International Leadership Development) Society, the Brennan Justice and Leadership Program and the U:PASS Program have all helped me to give back to the University and wider communities. What sort of work do you hope to be doing after you graduate? I’m hoping to eventually work in an area that combines my two areas of study – law and biotechnology. In particular, I would like to help reform the regulatory landscape that stifles innovation in areas such as biotech, but I think I’d call that a long term goal. In the meantime, with two years to go in my degree, I’m happy to work anywhere in the field, learning and increasing my experience. What is the most useful thing you have learned from your degree so far? By far the most important and valuable thing my degree has taught me is a solid work ethic and good time management. These things have been slow in the learning, and I’m sure that I can still improve in both areas, but the sooner you can start focusing on improving these skills, the better! Has anyone in particular at the University had a significant influence on your studies? I’ve met many people at the University who have inspired me with their example. From successful advocates to driven academics, from renowned innovators to individuals who are sticking to their passion and realising it – these people have showed me that the extraordinary isn’t out of reach; it’s just a matter of hard work and perseverance. What would your advice be for someone who is looking at studying Law at UTS? There are lots of things going for the UTS Law Faculty: award-winning teaching, an integrated practical focus and strong industry links, not to mention a great location. Is there anything else you’d like to add about your experience at UTS:Law, or the University as a whole? Get involved! The time you spend at university is some of the best time in your life, but you’ll only get out what you put in. There’s so much more to the university experience than just studying – there are the social, cultural and professional aspects, just to name a few. So explore the opportunities that UTS has to offer and be part of it!

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/design-architecture-and-building/about-design-architecture-and-building/featured-courses/bachelor-landscape-architecture-honours,"Learn to create the green and public spaces that make international cities great. Help to tackle the environmental and planetary issues of our time. No wonder careers in landscape architecture are booming. Find out more about Landscape Architecture (Honours) Make a difference to our global cities Study at the intersection of sustainability, ecology, environment and design. With the Bachelor of Landscape Architecture, you'll discover how landscapes and public spaces unify our complex urban environments, balancing sustainability concerns with the needs of contemporary society and culture. You’ll also have the chance to work across disciplines — architecture, art, planning, science and engineering – to respond to some of the critical challenges of our time, from climate change and urban densification to the loss of biodiversity. Zoe: I always knew I wanted to go into the design field and then kind of scrolling through the UTS website, I was just looking through their architecture options when I was kind of reading up on Landscape Architecture it was like a perfect balance between the structural elements of architecture, but also involving ecology, the environment. I think the environment is such an important issue at the moment and to nurture it and protect it and to be able to do that through design is pretty amazing. Mark: Landscape Architecture has a huge role in shaping the human experience of the city. Landscape Architecture is really about designing that setting where people live out their lives. I'd say it's one of the best kept secrets, because people assume that it is about landscaping or changing landscape on a small level when really it's about life. It's about culture. The public domain is always important, because it's that place that brings people together. Zoe: I've been working at TYRRELLSTUDIO for seven months. When I started working here, it was like everything, the past three years had just clicked into place. Hayley: Being able to work in practice while still at uni and having the two going at once, it makes you faster at doing little things and you get into the groove of it a lot more. The Western Sydney Parklands Project, it's a huge project and something that really interested me when I applied for the job here. Mark: So it's a vast and beautiful tract of land, a 1500 hectare park, which is five times the size of Central Park in New York, put aside as the greenbelt to limit the growth of Sydney in 1968 and since then, the city has leapt across that greenbelt and into western Sydney and more and more people will be living in western Sydney in the next 30 years, another one million people. So, there'll be a city three times the size of Canberra out there. So, a piece of greenbelt becomes a Central Park for these people. Some of the things we're doing to address the challenges of heat in that landscape are looking at the farm dam structure of water in that landscape. We're trying to take people into the coolest parts of the landscape and create these small areas where lots of people can gather and be in a more comfortable microclimate. Hayley: So what's different about working design is that you're not stressing, typically, for exams and taking notes and trying to cram information. You're actually working in the practical world and designing things that you're interested in. For now, doing honours year, you're given a lot more freedom as well as you progress in the course. So, that's kind of excited me, and now I think I will be coming back for something in postgrad as well. Great career prospects The prospects are good for landscape architects, with future jobs growth ranked in the highest 'Very Strong' category by the Australian government JobOutlook site (November 2021). Why study at UTS? Course highlights include: For ecologically minded students, landscape architecture’s emphasis on sustainability and the natural environment will also be rewarding. You’ll study in purpose-designed studios alongside academic and industry professionals, learning to create meaningful places and innovative solutions that put ecological thinking at the heart of your design practice. Get a global perspective At UTS, we believe it’s important for students to experience the best the world has to offer. You’ll have the opportunity to see your work in local, national and global contexts – hone your skills as an intern in a local practice, explore the landscapes of regional Australia or pursue international design studios, global study tours and student exchanges.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/transdisciplinary-innovation/undergraduate-courses/diploma-innovation/student-experience,"Hear from students about how the Diploma in Innovation adds value to their experience and helps develop practical, in-demand skills. The Diploma is a natural fit with Business, by taking a very human-centred approach to exploring problems. Business brings in the economic viability, while the Diploma emphasises the human-level and societal implications of the proposed solutions. These students are quick to adopt the entrepreneurial methods from the Diploma and have their horizons expanded by the creative intelligence methods. Meet Cooper McLean, one of our graduates. Here’s what he has to say about the Diploma. The Diploma in Innovation was a fantastic addition to my business degree. When completing both a finance and management major, the majority of the focus was on larger corporations and traditional structures of business. The Diploma challenged me to think differently about how businesses are operated and to take an agile approach to testing ideas that create change within a larger system. I continue to use the learnings from my course daily, working with my team in delivering value for our customers in new and innovative ways. Meet Alexandra Broad, one of our graduates who joined an innovation and co-design consultancy upon graduation. Speaking from personal experience, consultancy is a great way to get exposure to a wide range of organisations and their challenges before deciding the next career move. And, what better way to do that than via well-known innovation and co-design consultancy like TwoCollaborate. Communication, listening and expression of ideas are highly complementary of how to coordinate key stakeholders in an environment to generate value. Meet Olivia Baldini, who not only added the Diploma in Innovation to her BComm, but also followed up with the UTS Bachelors of Entrepreneurship (Honours), a one-year immersive and mentor-driven program that really brings out the longer-term implementation of innovative ideas. So many sectors are going through transition and becoming more networked and complex. Construction included. Meet Maddie King, who used her experience in creative problem solving to influence and lead change straight out of university: The construction industry is currently undergoing a revolutionary restructure to place innovation and sustainability at the forefront of project’s goals and targets. Naturally, I realised transdisciplinary thinking and creative problem solving were critical skills I had to develop in order to give me an edge in this competitive industry. By studying the Diploma in Innovation alongside my Bachelor of Construction Project Management degree, I have developed a unique perspective that has enabled me to make immediate impacts in my current position at Webuild, while also influencing my colleagues to have a more creative approach to complex problems. Meet Peter Binns. Peter has already taken up a series of professional roles relating to organisational innovation and collaboration, digital transform, and UX/UI. Along the way, he’s also becoming a serial entrepreneur. He is a graduate from Visual Communication who now works at Faethm AI. He was one of the first students to take 94663 Navigating Entrepreneurial Ecosystems and wrote up his experience in the subject. At the time, half the live classes were located right at the Sydney Startup Hub to immerse the cohort in the heart of Sydney’s startup ecosystem. For his project, Peter explored, mapped and proposed changes to the NSW educational ecosystem, including more support for transdisciplinary learning. Connor is one of those students who loves intense challenges. He completed all the Diploma in Innovation subjects within the first two years of his engineering degree, by taking two diploma subjects during the same three-week period. He’s off to a great start, with his work from 94663 Navigating Entrepreneurial Ecosystems being featured in the community news from Georges River Council (one of our industry partners that year), including this quote: ‘l liked most the opportunity to communicate directly with councils acting as the clients for the research being completed, a life lesson that will unquestionably assist with engineering work in the future.’ Connor has also had the pleasure of co-presenting the methods and results at the national Spark Festival. We can’t wait to see what he’ll get to when he graduates from his core degree! What a great pair: statistics and innovation! The former often focuses on patterns and repeatability, while the latter is more qualitative, experimental and creative. Beth Williams is one of those students looking to graduate with a significant point of difference.

https://www.uts.edu.au/study/health-gem/courses/orthoptics-courses/orthoptics-student-profiles/genevieve-mooney,"I graduated from the Master of Orthoptics at UTS in 2017. Prior to commencing the Orthoptics course, I had completed a Bachelor of Medical Science at UTS. I love camping, brunch and gory medical TV shows and I’m a little bit nerdy, getting way to excited (and boring everyone, I know) about any and all eye facts! I decided to study Orthoptics because I had always loved the idea of health and medicine and realised that I really loved explaining medical concepts to people. Towards the end of my undergraduate degree in Medical Science, I knew I needed to keep studying to be job ready. I could choose to do honours, and being in a lab wasn’t really exciting me anymore. I also rote-learnt a lot and didn’t feel at all prepared or qualified to leave university and get a job in the field. I also loved the riddle of diagnosing a person and working out their management. I decided that studying in an allied health industry was the perfect place to continue on my path to a career. I began researching what options were available to study as a post graduate degree and came across Orthoptics. I’d loved studying the eye during HSC Biology, and it turned out that orthoptists were in high demand and the job had plenty of branches for new career paths down the track. It ticked all the boxes! After already being a student at UTS for four years, I’d seen the beginning of the master plan being built and the introduction of the Graduate School of Health. During my undergraduate degree, we had the opportunity to spend some time in the health facilities with state of the art patient and clinical simulators to learn new skills. I also spent a lot of time in the labs and anatomy classrooms and knew I could expect modern teaching facilities with great staff. One of the best moments of my course was the first time I was able to confidently perform a full assessment on a child while on clinical placement! I also loved going on interstate placement and EyeBall (our end of year ball), which is a great social event with both students and staff. The course left me prepared and confident to begin working in the field immediately after graduation. I finished with a degree that is relevant, highly regarded and in demand. This meant that I was able to begin my professional life, get a job straight away and not have issues of unemployment or lack of confidence in my ability to work in the industry. The course is a lot of hard work! But it is really rewarding. You learn an enormous amount in the two year degree. The course is literally a full time degree and your days will be filled with lectures in the mornings and clinical skills classes in the afternoons. From teh second session onwards, you begin clinical placement where you get to see how it all works in the real world and get to begin to put all your clinical skills together. Assessments are varied from research papers to simulated and real life clinical exams. The practical exams seem really daunting but the teachers put a lot of time into preparing students with trial exams and exam simulations throughout semester. They are the best way to prepare for the real world! The cohort size is intimate and nothing like my undergraduate. You’ll know everyone in your year and be able to form close friendships and support networks. Not only will you form bonds with your peers, but you’ll get to know all the teaching staff who treat you as future colleagues, ensuring they impart as much wisdom on us as possible. The staff are super approachable and always there for help. The staff work in the industry and with the orthoptic professional bodies so know what is expected of us when we graduate and what is currently happening in clinics. I’m working in a variety of orthoptic disciplines including pediatrics, neuro, refractive and general ophthalmology. Every day is a little bit different and the patients definitely keep me on my toes. Between helping improve the vision in a child with amblyopia, helping someone manage their double vision, or seeing patient’s faces when they realise their improved vision after cataract surgery, I end my days feeling very rewarded. I want to keep working across a variety of ophthalmic specialties and continue to learn and contribute to orthoptics. I also hope to go on a volunteer overseas trip one day soon! My top tips for future students is to absorb everything you can when on clinical placements and try to leave your comfort zone to do patient assessments yourself. It is daunting but really worth it! A highlight of my time here was going on placement to Queensland where I was immersed in clinic life for three weeks straight. It was the absolute best way to learn.
