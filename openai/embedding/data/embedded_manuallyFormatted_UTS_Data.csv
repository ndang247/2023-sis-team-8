It also offers a four-year Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (C09066) and a three-year Bachelor of Engineering Science (C10066) to international students only, and a number of combined degrees in partnership with other faculties. The same educational philosophy underpins all awards: students undertake a set of core subjects, a set of practice subjects that defines their major and, in some cases, a set of electives. The Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice award requires the completion of two internships. The single Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and combined Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) courses require the completion of 12 weeks of work experience. The recognition of prior learning policies and assumed knowledge are the same for all courses. Course structure - The course comprises five principal components: (i) core program; (ii) Engineering Practice Program; (iii) field of practice (major); (iv) electives; and (v) Capstone Project. The core program, Engineering Practice Program and Capstone Project are common to all students undertaking the BE (Hons) DipProfEngPrac. Core program -This component provides a framework covering knowledge, skills and attributes that are relevant to all engineers across all fields of practice. It consists of common mathematics and physics subjects, and common engineering subjects which draw on several fields of engineering practice to develop interdisciplinary knowledge and skills within the larger context of professional practice. The core program runs throughout the course from admission to graduation. Students take differing combinations of subjects in their first year, and in each successive year, depending on their choice of major. Engineering Practice Program - The Engineering Practice Program supports and assesses student learning in workplace and community environments. Its objectives are to prepare students for engineering work experience, to support them during that experience and to assist them in maximising learning. The program also supports the integration of this experiential learning with the theoretical and practical aspects of the academic curriculum. A fundamental objective is to develop the ability to learn in a wide variety of modes and contexts and to critique and contribute to those learning environments on a lifelong basis. The program is administered through a series of subjects offered in various modes. Students enrol in the program as a whole and are guided through the respective modules. Students are ultimately responsible for their progression through the program. Academic staff and workplace mentors and supervisors act as facilitators; administrative staff assist in ensuring that students' progress is recorded and validated; and Industry Partnering Unit staff assist students in securing suitable work placements and in establishing cooperative programs with industry and the community. The minimum time in the workplace required to satisfy each engineering internship subject is 22 weeks. In total, however, 48 weeks must be gained by the required deadline to meet course requirements and to be eligible to graduate. Internships are organised into two blocks of six months each. Students are required to undertake the relevant prerequisite subjects prior to undertaking their internships and in a session following an internship are required to enrol in the appropriate review subjects. Credit point limits also apply to some of these subjects. While students are encouraged to undertake additional work experience, they are only permitted to complete each of the two official internships once. STM90993 Professional Engineering Practice Program subjects - Details of prerequisite subjects and subjects required to be completed after each internship are as follows: 41035 Professional Practice Preparation1 - 3cp, 41036 Professional Experience 1 - 6cp , 41037 Work Integrated Learning 1 - 12cp, 41038 Professional Practice Review 1 - 3cp, 41045 Professional Practice Preparation 2 - 3cp, 41046 Professional Experience 2 - 6cp, 41047 Work Integrated Learning 2 - 12p, 41048 Professional Practice Review 2 - 3cp, Total - 48p Electives - With the exception of combined degrees and double majors, students may devote 24 credit points to electives. A range of electives may be taken to broaden or deepen knowledge. The elective component also provides a mechanism for recognition of prior learning. Further, the elective component affords maximum flexibility for students wishing to undertake study on international exchange with our overseas partner institutions. Students are not permitted to take an elective subject that covers substantially the same material as a required subject or a subject already undertaken. Undergraduate students may enrol in approved UTS Engineering postgraduate subjects provided they have completed at least 120 credit points of their undergraduate degree and met prerequisite requirements. Undergraduate students may undertake up to four approved postgraduate subjects. A maximum of three approved postgraduate subjects recently undertaken as part of an undergraduate degree may be used to apply for exemptions from a UTS Engineering master's degree provided the subjects fulfil the equivalent subject requirements. Capstone Project - In the final sessions of the degree, each student undertakes a Capstone Project, supervised by a member of academic staff and designed to consolidate and integrate learning in all aspects of the program. Industry-linked projects, under joint supervision, are strongly encouraged. The project topic must be approved by an academic supervisor and must be relevant to the field of practice concerned. It may be largely technical in emphasis or it may encompass a range of technical and contextual challenges. The Capstone Project results in a substantial report which must be written and produced to professional engineering standards and must demonstrate the student's readiness for professional engineering practice. Recognition of prior learning - Students with relevant prior formal learning completed as part of a qualification (such as other university study or TAFE qualifications) in which study ceased no more than 10 years prior to the student's first semester of study may be entitled to recognition of prior learning in the form of subject exemptions. The level of recognition of prior learning depends on the relevance of the area of study to the proposed major in the BE(Hons) DipProfEngPrac. For a TAFE diploma in the same area, students can expect to receive between 24 and 36 credit points of exemptions, depending on the grades obtained in the TAFE subjects. Exemption from part of the Engineering Practice Program is granted only on the basis of actual work experience completed before commencing the course that can be shown to meet the required standards. The maximum exemption given is for one work-experience session. Without exception, all students in the engineering practice program must complete all components associated with the second internship. The faculty reserves the right to advise any student who is admitted with recognition of prior learning, and who is not succeeding in the program, to undertake some or all of the subjects from which exemption had been granted. Majors - Majors are currently offered in the following engineering sub-disciplines: biomedical (not available in the BEngSc and combined degrees with medical science and science), civil (with specialisations in construction and structures), civil and environmental (not available in the BEngSc and combined degrees), data, electrical, electrical and electronic (not available in the BEngSc and combined degrees), electronic, flexible (no specified major), mechanical, mechanical and mechatronic (not available in the BEngSc and combined degrees), mechatronic, software. The name of the major completed appears on the student's academic transcript and testamur.","[-0.009634681977331638, -0.012469606474041939, -0.006596780382096767, -0.04828166589140892,

1,https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c09067.html,"C09067v6 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice - The program leading to the award of Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice (C09067) (BE(Hons) DipProfEngPrac) is a comprehensive preparation for careers in the professional practice of engineering. The BE(Hons) DipProfEngPrac is a combined award and the Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice is not available separately. Both elements of the program are closely interwoven and interdependent, and prepare students for professional engineering internships by linking theory and application. The degrees combining engineering with business, international studies, medical science and science may also be combined with the Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice. As noted above, the combination of formal academic learning in the University and experiential learning in the workplace is called 'cooperative education'. UTS Engineering courses have embodied this principle for over 30 years. The courses are highly regarded in industry and, according to many reports and surveys, graduates have enjoyed correspondingly high employment rates – the highest of any engineering degree courses in Australia. Engineering education in many countries is undergoing revolutionary change and the UTS program is at the forefront of much of this change. Overview - This program is a comprehensive preparation for careers in the professional practice of engineering. Students learn to deal with complex systems and manage large-scale projects using the most appropriate emerging technologies. The course offers an authentic, professionally focused and practice-based education program with two sessions of internship (normally paid) in a real workplace setting. A number of the areas of study are available with explicit specialisations. For example, Civil Engineering is available with specialisations in Structures and Construction. Students can also focus on or broaden their studies by completing electives. By appropriate choice of electives, students can gain knowledge in a second engineering discipline, obtain a sub-major in a different field or study postgraduate-level subjects and apply for credit towards an engineering master's degree. The concept has been strongly endorsed in wide-ranging industry consultations. Interaction between work experience and academic curriculum is very strong, giving the program a depth that no other full-time academic course can match. Course aims - The course aims to equip graduates with the skills and attributes needed for professional practice and leadership. It is based on the themes of academic development, personal development and professional formation. It provides sound foundations in engineering theory, technical expertise and knowledge of professional practice, while also developing academic literacy, advocacy skills and social awareness so that graduates become lifelong learners and effective citizens in many different capacities. Career options - Career options depend on the major chosen. Course intended learning outcomes - A.1 - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice graduates are culturally and historically well informed, able to co-design projects as respectful professionals when working in and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, B.1 - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice graduates identify, engage, interpret and analyse stakeholder needs and cultural perspectives, establish priorities and goals, and identify constraints, uncertainties and risks (social, ethical, cultural, legislative, environmental, economics etc.) to define the system requirements, C.1 - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice graduates apply research, problem solving, design and decision-making methodologies to develop components, systems and processes to meet specified requirements, D.1 - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice graduates apply abstraction, mathematics and discipline fundamentals, software, tools and techniques to evaluate, implement and operate systems, E.1 - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice graduates work as an effective member or leader of diverse teams, communicating effectively and operating within cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural contexts in the workplace, F.1 - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice graduates critically self-review their performance to improve themselves, their teams and workplace. They take responsibility and accountability for their own life long learning. Admission requirements - Applicants must have completed an Australian Year 12 qualification, Australian Qualifications Framework Diploma, or equivalent Australian or overseas qualification at the required level. Current school leavers are advised to complete the Year 12 Engineering and IT Questionnaire. The questionnaire allows applicants to demonstrate their strong motivation to study engineering or IT at UTS and may assist applicants whose ATAR falls short of the required cut-off by up to three points. Non-current school leavers are advised to complete the employment question on their UAC application and provide supporting statements of employment to UAC, as adjustment factors may be applied on the basis of relevant work experience. The English proficiency requirement for international students or local applicants with international qualifications is: Academic IELTS: 6.5 overall with a writing score of 6.0; or TOEFL: paper based: 550-583 overall with TWE of 4.5, internet based: 79-93 overall with a writing score of 21; or AE5: Pass; or PTE: 58-64 with a writing score of 50; or C1A/C2P: 176-184 with a writing score of 169. Eligibility for admission does not guarantee offer of a place. Local students - Entry to individual engineering majors is subject to ATAR requirements. International students - Applicants who successfully complete a recognised pathway program are eligible to apply. Visa requirement: To obtain a student visa to study in Australia, international students must enrol full time and on campus. Australian student visa regulations also require international students studying on student visas to complete the course within the standard full-time duration. Students can extend their courses only in exceptional circumstances. Pathway course - Applicants who complete the UTS College Diploma of Engineering with no more than two subject failures are guaranteed admission to the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice with up to 48 credit points of recognition of prior learning (depending on the major selected). Inherent (essential) requirements - Inherent (essential) requirements are academic and non-academic requirements that are essential to the successful completion of a course. Prospective and current students should carefully read the Inherent (Essential) Requirements Statement below and consider whether they might experience challenges in successfully completing this course. This Statement should be read in conjunction with the UTS Student Rules. Prospective or current student concerned about their ability to meet these requirements should discuss their concerns with the Academic Liaison Officer in their faculty or school and/or UTS Accessibility Service on 9514 1177 or at accessibility@uts.edu.au. UTS will make reasonable adjustments to teaching and learning, assessment, professional experiences, course related work experience and other course activities to facilitate maximum participation by students with disabilities, carer responsibilities, and religious or cultural obligations in their courses. For course specific information see the Faculty of Engineering & Information Technology Inherent (Essential) Requirements Statement. Assumed knowledge - HSC Mathematics Extension 1; Physics; and English Standard. English Advanced is recommended. For the Biomedical, Civil, and Civil and Environmental Engineering majors, Chemistry is recommended. For the Software Engineering major, a sound knowledge of the fundamentals of programming is recommended. Recognition of prior learning - Students who have previously undertaken relevant study at a recognised tertiary education institution may be eligible for recognition of prior learning (RPL) if the subjects completed are deemed by the faculty to be equivalent to subjects in the student's course. Subjects completed as part of a qualification in which study ceased no more than 10 years prior to the student's first semester in the relevant UTS Engineering degree may be considered. Limits apply to the number of credit points of RPL granted. Course duration and attendance - Full-time students normally complete the program in five years, which includes four years of study plus two periods of engineering internship in the workplace totalling at least 48 weeks. The internship is typically taken in the third or fourth session and again in the seventh or eighth session. It is possible to complete the program entirely on a part-time basis, with continuous concurrent employment, by enrolling at half the full-time rate; however, this is not recommended. Students wishing to make extensive use of part-time attendance are strongly encouraged to negotiate with their employers for at least two full-time sessions of study somewhere through the program. Course structure - Students are required to complete 240 credit points, comprising:core program: 48 credit points, major (field of practice), including capstone: 120 credit points , professional engineering practice program: 48 credit points, plus 48 weeks of approved internship, electives (within this component students may undertake a faculty-approved sub-major totalling 24 credit points): 24 credit points. Students in the Civil Engineering major, Structures stream are recommended to complete 12 credit points of electives from approved postgraduate structural engineering subjects. Students in the Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering majors are required to select the specialist stream in their major in place of the electives. The major is selected at the time of application to the course; however, it is possible to apply to change major at a later date. Students admitted to the flexible major should decide by the end of the first year of full-time study whether to transfer to a designated major or continue with the flexible program. The Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice is not offered as a standalone qualification. Industrial training/professional practice - The Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice requires the completion of two six-month internships and the Professional Engineering Practice Program. Completing 12 months of relevant engineering experience before graduating enables students to link learning in the workplace and learning at university, with each experience enhancing the other.

2,https://handbook.uts.edu.au/subjects/details/48230.html,"48230 Introduction to Engineering Projects UTS: Engineering: Professional Practice and Leadership Credit points: 6 cp Subject level: Undergraduate Result type: Grade and marks Anti-requisite(s): 31265 Communication for IT Professionals Description This subject develops students' professional engineering practice skills within the context of a real-life engineering project, through the Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Challenge. Students work in teams to create an appropriate design solution for a given problem as set out in the EWB Challenge Design Brief. While applying the central role of effective communication and teamwork in engineering practice, students develop an understanding of the social, cultural, economic and environmental responsibilities of a professional engineer. This subject is a starting point for students' ongoing professional development that they undertake throughout their studies and as a professional engineer in their career. The skills introduced include understanding and applying principles of effective communication; researching the various discipline areas that inform the development of an engineering design solution; applying the engineering design process to identify, formulate and design a solution to solve a problem while considering socio-technical issues; written and oral communication for engineering contexts; expressing engineering concepts through visual communication; and, leading and participating in team processes. Subject learning objectives (SLOs) Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to: 1.Demonstrate an awareness of Indigenous Australian cultural, historic, and contemporary contexts in order to inform work in a complex project 2.Identify stakeholder needs through the empathise design stage 3.Apply a design thinking approach to develop solutions that meet stakeholder needs 4.Communicate an evidence-based design solution for an engineering project 5.Explain how different experiences of a diverse team work together to achieve a design solution Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs) This subject also contributes specifically to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs): Indigenous Professional Capability: FEIT graduates are culturally and historically well informed, able to co-design projects as respectful professionals when working in and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. (A.1) Socially Responsible: FEIT graduates identify, engage, interpret and analyse stakeholder needs and cultural perspectives, establish priorities and goals, and identify constraints, uncertainties and risks (social, ethical, cultural, legislative, environmental, economics etc.) to define the system requirements. (B.1) Design Oriented: FEIT graduates apply problem solving, design and decision-making methodologies to develop components, systems and processes to meet specified requirements. (C.1) Collaborative and Communicative: FEIT graduates work as an effective member or leader of diverse teams, communicating effectively and operating within cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural contexts in the workplace. (E.1) Contribution to the development of graduate attributes Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies This subject contributes to the development of the following Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies: 1.5. Knowledge of engineering design practice and contextual factors impacting the engineering discipline. 2.3. Application of systematic engineering synthesis and design processes. 3.2. Effective oral and written communication in professional and lay domains. 3.6. Effective team membership and team leadership. Teaching and learning strategies Each week students are required to prepare for tutorial classes by completing a set of online pre-class tasks provided on Canvas. The tasks involve such activities as reading from key resources, watching a video, completing a quiz, and other online exercises. Responses to the pre-class tasks are used in tutorial classes to add depth to discussion and are an essential component to the concepts covered throughout the subject. During tutorial classes, students will build on the pre-class tasks to learn and apply new skills. These skills will be practiced in class and are designed to be relevant to the tasks involved in the EWB Challenge team project. Areas of learning in tutorial classes include problem solving, team building, exploring scenarios, design and build activities, project management, reflection and group discussion. Activities support acquisition of professional engineering skills in a small group setting under the supervision of a tutor; these skills relate directly to your major EWB Challenge team project. OPELA: An aim of this subject is to help you develop academic and professional language and communication skills in order to succeed at university and in the workplace. To determine your current academic language proficiency, you are required to complete an online language screening task, OPELA. If you receive a Basic grade for OPELA, you must attend additional Language Development Tutorials (each week from weeks 3 to 12) in order to pass the subject. The development of these tutorials is a new university-wide initiative designed to provide personalised support and enhance students’ English language skills. They will focus on developing your communication skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) and your independent learning skills, which will help you to prepare for the subject assessment tasks and for professional workplace communication tasks.

Teaching and learning strategies The subject has one contact hour in Week 1 and three contact hours per week in the remaining weeks. A weekly online study module presents new material in the form of videos and written articles and shows working examples of code. Each study module on average is expected to take 1 hour to complete and needs to be completed before coming to the lecture and the lab. Note that access to the lab material is electronically blocked until the student has completed the required weekly study module. Regular lectures include interactive quizzes and reflections on the key topics and techniques. A weekly two-hour lab session gives students practice working in groups to analyse software specifications and construct software plans, and practice working individually to write, debug and run code. Content (topics) Basic programming plans Design rules and notations Debugging Strings Classes Linked lists Inheritance How to build a GUI The event model GUI Lists and list models GUI tables and table models Assessment Assessment task 1: Labs Intent: The labs, both assessed and non-assessed, provide practice in programming.

It is led by a student who has previously achieved a distinction or high distinction in the subject area, and who has a good WAM. Leaders will prepare activities for you to work on in groups based on the content you are learning in lectures and tutorials. It’s really relaxed, friendly, and informal. Because the leader is a student just like you, they understand what it’s like to study the subject and how to do well, and they can pass those tips along to you. Students also say it’s a great way to meet new people and a guaranteed study hour. You can sign up for U:PASS sessions via U:PASS website https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/upass/upass/sessions/register-sessions. Note that sign up is not open until week 2, as it’s voluntary and only students who want to go should sign up. If you have any questions or concerns about U:PASS, please contact Georgina at upass@uts.edu.au, or check out the website.","[0.0071136970072984695, -0.0064666857942938805, 0.005884718615561724,

This subject introduces the core programming concepts using an object-oriented approach to programming, prioritising project-based learning and independent research, experimentation, and communication skills. Additionally, most programming in industry occurs as alterations to a portion of a large existing codebase, and this subject introduces students to how their initial programming explorations may eventually expand to making fixes or improvements to complex industry-scale projects. Subject learning objectives (SLOs) Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to: 1.Apply basic programming concepts of state, iteration, and decision 2.Solve computational problems by using abstract modelling and conceptualisation 3.Design and create simple functioning programs to achieve objectives 4.Interpret, describe, and document programs using clear communication 5.Reflect on programming decisions and formulate alternatives Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs) This subject also contributes specifically to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs): Design Oriented: FEIT graduates apply problem solving, design and decision-making methodologies to develop components, systems and processes to meet specified requirements. (C.1) Technically Proficient: FEIT graduates apply abstraction, mathematics and discipline fundamentals, software, tools and techniques to evaluate, implement and operate systems. (D.1) Collaborative and Communicative: FEIT graduates work as an effective member or leader of diverse teams, communicating effectively and operating within cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural contexts in the workplace. (E.1) Contribution to the development of graduate attributes Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies This subject contributes to the development of the following Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies: 1.1. Comprehensive, theory based understanding of the underpinning natural and physical sciences and the engineering fundamentals applicable to the engineering discipline. 1.2. Conceptual understanding of the mathematics, numerical analysis, statistics, and computer and information sciences which underpin the engineering discipline. 2.1. Application of established engineering methods to complex engineering problem solving. 2.2. Fluent application of engineering techniques, tools and resources. 2.3. Application of systematic engineering synthesis and design processes. 3.2. Effective oral and written communication in professional and lay domains. Teaching and learning strategies This subject will employ several parallel learning structures to allow students to find a mixture of learning experiences that suits their particular needs. The flipped lecture format allows the students to engage with the learning material in an asynchronous, self-paced, location-independent manner. It also supports a modular approach to delivering core content, permitting students to revise, engage and re-engage as suits their needs. Included in the learning material are staged practice exercises to help the students develop their knowledge and skills in a consequence- and stress-free environment. In the workshops, this learning will be reinforced with scaffolded exercises that weave the core material together and provide a practical experience of the subject matter. These exercises are then capped with a low-stakes assessment task to help the students gauge their progress and understanding of the material. Tying these two structural components together is the weekly drop-in sessions, that offer students a face-to-face expert contact point tailored to their current progress, addressing the exact difficulties they are facing at the time. The learning material also builds towards the larger, ongoing project, which ties the content together into a functioning whole. Content (topics) 1. Simplest Working Program, and Simple Output 2. Data Types and Variables 3. Decisions and Branching Program Flow 4. Arrays and User Input 5. Loops and Iterative Program Flow 6. Classes and Constructors 7. Methods, Properties and Access Control 8. Lists and Polymorphism 9. File Input and Output 10. Object Oriented Programming Techniques and Structures 11. Inheritance and Interfaces 12. Review and Preview of Programming 2 Assessment Assessment task 1: Lab Assessments Intent: This task provides a mixture of formative and summative assessment to allow students to gauge their progress towards the subject objectives in a low-stakes, controlled environment. Objective(s): This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs): 1, 2, 3 and 5 This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs): C.1 and D.1 Type:Exercises Groupwork:Individual Weight:30% Assessment task 2: Code Comprehension Intent: The ability to understand code at a higher level than simple line-by-line translation is a key skill in developing strong mental models supporting program design and development skills. Being able to read, comprehend and explain code is a fundamental step in developing deeper understanding. Objective(s): This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs): 4 and 5 This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs): C.1 and E.1 Type:Exercises Groupwork:Individual Weight:25% Length: 50-100 lines of code, commented. Assessment task 3: Project Intent: While understanding of the elements of a computer program is foundational, without comprehending how they function in a larger whole the core goal of programming is lost. This task combines the individual elements learnt throughout the subject into a single, functioning whole. Objective(s): This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs): 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs): C.1, D.1 and E.1 Type:Project Groupwork:Individual Weight:25% Length: Approximately 500 lines of code. Assessment task 4: Exam Intent: Programming well requires robust mental models of both the problem to be solved and the tools and approaches that can potentially be used to solve it. The exam is an opportunity for students to demonstrate understanding of key elements of programming skills independent of more complicated software development concerns. Objective(s): This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs): 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs): C.1, D.1 and E.1 Type:Examination Groupwork:Individual Weight:20% Length: 1 day Assessment task 5: Extension Intent: Knowledge and skill can be demonstrated in many ways. In programming subjects in particular, more sustained and free-form development than that allowed by normal assessment tasks can reveal a deeper understanding than otherwise apparent. This task offers the opportunity for students to demonstrate a higher degree of knowledge and skill through work on more difficult computational and programming problems that extend beyond the immediate material of the subject. Objective(s): This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs): 1, 2, 3 and 5 This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs): C.1 and D.1 Type:Project Groupwork:Individual Weight:Mandatory task that does not contribute to subject mark Minimum requirements To pass this subject, students must achieve an overall mark of 50% or greater.

Teaching and learning strategies Lectures: Two 90 minute lectures per week Lecture materials including detailed notes are provided in Canvas for students to read before the class. Concepts and definitions are explored through the use of both pure and applied examples. Students have the opportunity to make notes and question concepts. Tutorials: One one-hour tutorial per week Students are required to attempt problems posted in Canvas before they come to the tutorial. These problems develop the concepts delivered in the previous lecture. In class students can ask questions about areas they don't understand with either their peers or their tutors. Computer labs: Three one-hour computer labs and eight mastery test sessions (four tests with a second chance sitting) Students work in the computer labs individually and in pairs. There is a problem sheet made available in Canvas which students use to prepare before they come to the lab. During the class students interact with the tutors and other students to complete the problems. The three labs make use of a program called minitab. This practice allows students the opportunity to get feedback in preparation for the Mastery Tests. The Mastery Tests are interspersed between the computer labs. The material covered in the computer lab relates to the subsequent Mastery tests. After each test submission students get immediate feedback on correct or incorrect responses. The maths study centre is then available as a support mechanism for students to get feedback on incorrect responses and work through correct solutions. The subject coordinator will offer further feedback as a third step. Webassign is the program used for practice tests. These can be accessed online by students at any time during the semester and students receive immediate feedback after each question is submitted. These questions cover all of the subject materials. Forms of attendance in this subject online flexible. There will be subject announcements indicating opportunities to attend campus, alternatively all activities can be completed online. Content (topics) Topics include: linear algebra including eigenvalues and eigenvectors and applications; 3D geometry and functions of several variables; partial derivatives; optimisation; multiple integrals and their applications; probability with a focus on the determination of the reliability of a system of components in various engineering contexts; descriptive statistics, probability distributions, statistical inference, introduction to linear regression. Minitab is used in the statistics part of the subject. Other software will be used as appropriate.

U:PASS (UTS Peer Assisted Study Success) is a voluntary  study session  where you will be studying the subject with other students in a group. It is led by a student who has previously achieved a distinction or high distinction in the subject area, and who has a good WAM. Leaders will prepare activities for you to work on in groups based on the content you are learning in lectures and tutorials. It’s really relaxed, friendly, and informal. Because the leader is a student just like you, they understand what it’s like to study the subject and how to do well, and they can pass those tips along to you. Students also say it’s a great way to meet new people and a  guaranteed study hour . You can sign up for U:PASS sessions via U:PASS website http://tinyurl.com/upass2017 Note that sign up is not open until week 2, as it’s voluntary and only students who want to go should sign up.

Teaching and learning strategies 1.5 hour lecture and 1.5 hour tutorial per week UTS has embraced the ‘flipped education’ model, rather than only attending lectures, students access digital resources and undertake preliminary tasks prior to coming to tutorial and lecture where they engage in collaborative, mentored activities. Learning in this subject includes viewing videos and recommended reading (both available from the UTS Library); each lecture contains details of preparation work for the following tutorial. Tutorial participation marks depend on the completion of the FLIP learning work as well as participation in tutorial. Content (topics) The major topics are: Quality Assurance Principles Definition of quality for software products, quality characteristics and their relationships, setting measurable and testable quality attributes, the relationship between the QA Function, Software Developers and Management. Implementing Software Quality Assurance SQA Plans: characteristics and documentation, quality standards, configuration management, quality audit, quality assurance justification, effectiveness and cost of SQA Verification, Validation and Test VV&T methods and techniques, VV&T tools, relation of VV&T to all phases of the software development life cycle, the processes of VV&T appropriate to each of the life cycle phases Quality Management practice How Quality impacts the business and its customers. The required infrastructure including testing tools, environments. The people and skills needed for good quality and the interaction of the test team and their work on other IT groups.

See access conditions. Anti-requisite(s): 31424 Systems Modelling AND 31475 Requirements Engineering AND 31485 Systems Development Description This subject introduces information system concepts and describes how these concepts can be used to model business requirements. It outlines how the ability to capture information about the system in ways understood by its eventual users improves the final quality of the system. An overview of agile and non-agile software engineering principles, methods, tools and techniques is presented and practised in small teams. The subject introduces various analysis approaches found in contemporary system development including object-oriented methods, agile methods, business process modelling and entity-relationship modelling. It explores the relationships between these techniques and their application, and how they are used to capture and model the business requirements. Students apply various requirements elicitation, analysis, modelling and specification techniques to case studies in small teams. Subject learning objectives (SLOs) Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to: 1.Identify stakeholders, understand their needs, and learn what/how to capture requirements in the system development process. 2.Apply modelling and systems analysis techniques that help understand the working of a business system. 3.Document and specify various requirements via Software Requirements Specification (SRS). 4.Develop various models using a range of systems analysis techniques to analyse and specify system and user requirements. 5.Work effectively in a small team. Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs) This subject also contributes specifically to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs): Socially Responsible: FEIT graduates identify, engage, interpret and analyse stakeholder needs and cultural perspectives, establish priorities and goals, and identify constraints, uncertainties and risks (social, ethical, cultural, legislative, environmental, economics etc.) to define the system requirements. (B.1) Design Oriented: FEIT graduates apply problem solving, design and decision-making methodologies to develop components, systems and processes to meet specified requirements. (C.1) Technically Proficient: FEIT graduates apply abstraction, mathematics and discipline fundamentals, software, tools and techniques to evaluate, implement and operate systems. (D.1) Collaborative and Communicative: FEIT graduates work as an effective member or leader of diverse teams, communicating effectively and operating within cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural contexts in the workplace. (E.1) Contribution to the development of graduate attributes Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies This subject contributes to the development of the following Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies: 1.1. Comprehensive, theory based understanding of the underpinning natural and physical sciences and the engineering fundamentals applicable to the engineering discipline. 1.5. Knowledge of engineering design practice and contextual factors impacting the engineering discipline. 1.6. Understanding of the scope, principles, norms, accountabilities and bounds of sustainable engineering practice in the specific discipline. 2.2.

Effective team membership and team leadership. Teaching and learning strategies This subject uses a lecture followed by a tutorial format. The tutorial provides collaborative and active learning workshops to support a practice-focused learning strategy. This subject is based on a practical case study and provides regular feedback. The teaching and learning approach is based on learning by doing collaborative work based on case studies. In lectures, topics from the recommended texts are covered and additional material from other sources is introduced where necessary. After introducing the concept and topic in the lecture, students will further apply and practice these topics via interactive and collaborative exercises during the workshops in the tutorials. Additionally, students will be provided with illustrative examples, practice exercises and case studies that further reinforce the material. The lecture followed by a tutorial format are also an extra opportunity for students to ask questions and generate a discussion based on Canvas material. Students will engage in a range of activities such as role playing, think-pair-share, attempting short quizzes each week, short presentations, working in groups, group discussion, critiquing other students’ work, problem solving exercises, analysing stakeholder needs, etc. During tutorials, students will apply the material and build a working relationship with other team members in a collaborative group learning environment. The collaborative and active learning environment will require students to work with other students in small groups on tutorial and assignment case study exercises. For the assignment case study, students are required to do some pre-work and bring the work in progress (draft models) to the tutorial sessions. Regular feedback will be provided to students each week in the tutorial, for both in-class case studies as well as the assignment case study. This will enable students to identify and correct any issues before formal submission of assignments, and consequently improve their learning and performance in the subject. For weekly assessable quizzes, each week immediate feedback will be provided straight after students have attempted the assessable weekly quizzes. Quizzes will be marked each week and marks will be uploaded to Canvas so that students can track their progress and performance in the subject regularly and before the census date. Please note students are expected to put in some additional study time outside of class time. The University regards a 6 credit point subject as requiring 9-12 hours of study per week, including class time. Students must read the recommended and reference books outside of class time so that they can effectively participate in group work and discussions that are integral to the understanding of the topics. An aim of this subject is to help you develop academic and professional language and communication skills to succeed at university and in the workplace. During the course of this subject, you will complete a milestone assessment task that will, in addition to assessing your subject-specific learning objectives, evaluate your levels of academic and professional communication.

Skills Development Tests will be held in the tutorial, with feedback given the following week. For students who cannot attend face-toface tutorials, they may apply to attend the online tutorial, with priority given to overseas attendees. In the tutorials, students may be required to work in groups, as discussion of mathematical ideas helps students to learn. Students will be working through problems with the assistance of the tutor, who may also demonstrate mathematical modelling techniques and mathematical programming which the students can then investigate themselves. Students will get more value from the tutorials if they have attempted all tutorial problems before attending the tutorials. Lectures may be supplemented by a live, on campus workshop to answer student questions. Content (topics) Vectors and their application to physical problems. Functions and their relationship to measurement and the interpretation of physical results. Trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions. Inverse functions. Hyperbolic functions. Differentiation. Integrals and methods of integration. Complex numbers. Differential equations arising from physical problems. Oscillatory motion. Matrix multiplication and determinants. Sequences and series, power series including Taylor series. Assessment Assessment task 1: Skills Development Tests Intent: These short tests (10 in total, of equal weighting) will provide regular feedback on how students are mastering the necessary skills in each area of the subject. They will be held in the tutorial classes according to the schedule.
