https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"Information Regarding Undergraduate Engineering - The Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology's flagship course is the five-year Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice (C09067). It also offers a four-year Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (C09066) and a three-year Bachelor of Engineering Science (C10066) to international students only, and a number of combined degrees in partnership with other faculties. The same educational philosophy underpins all awards: students undertake a set of core subjects, a set of practice subjects that defines their major and, in some cases, a set of electives. The Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice award requires the completion of two internships. The single Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and combined Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) courses require the completion of 12 weeks of work experience. The recognition of prior learning policies and assumed knowledge are the same for all courses."
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"Course structure - The course comprises five principal components: (i) core program; (ii) Engineering Practice Program; (iii) field of practice (major); (iv) electives; and (v) Capstone Project. The core program, Engineering Practice Program and Capstone Project are common to all students undertaking the BE (Hons) DipProfEngPrac."
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"Core program -This component provides a framework covering knowledge, skills and attributes that are relevant to all engineers across all fields of practice. It consists of common mathematics and physics subjects, and common engineering subjects which draw on several fields of engineering practice to develop interdisciplinary knowledge and skills within the larger context of professional practice. The core program runs throughout the course from admission to graduation. Students take differing combinations of subjects in their first year, and in each successive year, depending on their choice of major."
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"Engineering Practice Program - The Engineering Practice Program supports and assesses student learning in workplace and community environments. Its objectives are to prepare students for engineering work experience, to support them during that experience and to assist them in maximising learning. The program also supports the integration of this experiential learning with the theoretical and practical aspects of the academic curriculum. A fundamental objective is to develop the ability to learn in a wide variety of modes and contexts and to critique and contribute to those learning environments on a lifelong basis. The program is administered through a series of subjects offered in various modes. Students enrol in the program as a whole and are guided through the respective modules. Students are ultimately responsible for their progression through the program. Academic staff and workplace mentors and supervisors act as facilitators; administrative staff assist in ensuring that students' progress is recorded and validated; and Industry Partnering Unit staff assist students in securing suitable work placements and in establishing cooperative programs with industry and the community. The minimum time in the workplace required to satisfy each engineering internship subject is 22 weeks. In total, however, 48 weeks must be gained by the required deadline to meet course requirements and to be eligible to graduate. Internships are organised into two blocks of six months each. Students are required to undertake the relevant prerequisite subjects prior to undertaking their internships and in a session following an internship are required to enrol in the appropriate review subjects. Credit point limits also apply to some of these subjects. While students are encouraged to undertake additional work experience, they are only permitted to complete each of the two official internships once."
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"STM90993 Professional Engineering Practice Program subjects - Details of prerequisite subjects and subjects required to be completed after each internship are as follows: 41035 Professional Practice Preparation1 - 3cp, 41036 Professional Experience 1 - 6cp , 41037 Work Integrated Learning 1 - 12cp, 41038 Professional Practice Review 1 - 3cp, 41045 Professional Practice Preparation 2 - 3cp, 41046 Professional Experience 2 - 6cp, 41047 Work Integrated Learning 2 - 12p, 41048 Professional Practice Review 2 - 3cp, Total - 48p"
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"Electives - With the exception of combined degrees and double majors, students may devote 24 credit points to electives. A range of electives may be taken to broaden or deepen knowledge. The elective component also provides a mechanism for recognition of prior learning. Further, the elective component affords maximum flexibility for students wishing to undertake study on international exchange with our overseas partner institutions. Students are not permitted to take an elective subject that covers substantially the same material as a required subject or a subject already undertaken. Undergraduate students may enrol in approved UTS Engineering postgraduate subjects provided they have completed at least 120 credit points of their undergraduate degree and met prerequisite requirements. Undergraduate students may undertake up to four approved postgraduate subjects. A maximum of three approved postgraduate subjects recently undertaken as part of an undergraduate degree may be used to apply for exemptions from a UTS Engineering master's degree provided the subjects fulfil the equivalent subject requirements."
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c09067.html,"C09067v6 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice - The program leading to the award of Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice (C09067) (BE(Hons) DipProfEngPrac) is a comprehensive preparation for careers in the professional practice of engineering. The BE(Hons) DipProfEngPrac is a combined award and the Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice is not available separately. Both elements of the program are closely interwoven and interdependent, and prepare students for professional engineering internships by linking theory and application. The degrees combining engineering with business, international studies, medical science and science may also be combined with the Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice. As noted above, the combination of formal academic learning in the University and experiential learning in the workplace is called 'cooperative education'. UTS Engineering courses have embodied this principle for over 30 years. The courses are highly regarded in industry and, according to many reports and surveys, graduates have enjoyed correspondingly high employment rates – the highest of any engineering degree courses in Australia. Engineering education in many countries is undergoing revolutionary change and the UTS program is at the forefront of much of this change. Overview - This program is a comprehensive preparation for careers in the professional practice of engineering. Students learn to deal with complex systems and manage large-scale projects using the most appropriate emerging technologies. The course offers an authentic, professionally focused and practice-based education program with two sessions of internship (normally paid) in a real workplace setting. A number of the areas of study are available with explicit specialisations. For example, Civil Engineering is available with specialisations in Structures and Construction. Students can also focus on or broaden their studies by completing electives. By appropriate choice of electives, students can gain knowledge in a second engineering discipline, obtain a sub-major in a different field or study postgraduate-level subjects and apply for credit towards an engineering master's degree. The concept has been strongly endorsed in wide-ranging industry consultations. Interaction between work experience and academic curriculum is very strong, giving the program a depth that no other full-time academic course can match. Course aims - The course aims to equip graduates with the skills and attributes needed for professional practice and leadership. It is based on the themes of academic development, personal development and professional formation. It provides sound foundations in engineering theory, technical expertise and knowledge of professional practice, while also developing academic literacy, advocacy skills and social awareness so that graduates become lifelong learners and effective citizens in many different capacities.

This subject introduces the core programming concepts using an object-oriented approach to programming, prioritising project-based learning and independent research, experimentation, and communication skills. Additionally, most programming in industry occurs as alterations to a portion of a large existing codebase, and this subject introduces students to how their initial programming explorations may eventually expand to making fixes or improvements to complex industry-scale projects. Subject learning objectives (SLOs) Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to: 1.Apply basic programming concepts of state, iteration, and decision 2.Solve computational problems by using abstract modelling and conceptualisation 3.Design and create simple functioning programs to achieve objectives 4.Interpret, describe, and document programs using clear communication 5.Reflect on programming decisions and formulate alternatives Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs) This subject also contributes specifically to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs): Design Oriented: FEIT graduates apply problem solving, design and decision-making methodologies to develop components, systems and processes to meet specified requirements.

Application of systematic engineering synthesis and design processes. 3.2. Effective oral and written communication in professional and lay domains. Teaching and learning strategies This subject will employ several parallel learning structures to allow students to find a mixture of learning experiences that suits their particular needs. The flipped lecture format allows the students to engage with the learning material in an asynchronous, self-paced, location-independent manner. It also supports a modular approach to delivering core content, permitting students to revise, engage and re-engage as suits their needs. Included in the learning material are staged practice exercises to help the students develop their knowledge and skills in a consequence- and stress-free environment. In the workshops, this learning will be reinforced with scaffolded exercises that weave the core material together and provide a practical experience of the subject matter. These exercises are then capped with a low-stakes assessment task to help the students gauge their progress and understanding of the material. Tying these two structural components together is the weekly drop-in sessions, that offer students a face-to-face expert contact point tailored to their current progress, addressing the exact difficulties they are facing at the time. The learning material also builds towards the larger, ongoing project, which ties the content together into a functioning whole. Content (topics) 1. Simplest Working Program, and Simple Output 2. Data Types and Variables 3. Decisions and Branching Program Flow 4. Arrays and User Input 5. Loops and Iterative Program Flow 6. Classes and Constructors 7. Methods, Properties and Access Control 8.

The tutorial provides collaborative and active learning workshops to support a practice-focused learning strategy. This subject is based on a practical case study and provides regular feedback. The teaching and learning approach is based on learning by doing collaborative work based on case studies. In lectures, topics from the recommended texts are covered and additional material from other sources is introduced where necessary. After introducing the concept and topic in the lecture, students will further apply and practice these topics via interactive and collaborative exercises during the workshops in the tutorials. Additionally, students will be provided with illustrative examples, practice exercises and case studies that further reinforce the material. The lecture followed by a tutorial format are also an extra opportunity for students to ask questions and generate a discussion based on Canvas material. Students will engage in a range of activities such as role playing, think-pair-share, attempting short quizzes each week, short presentations, working in groups, group discussion, critiquing other students’ work, problem solving exercises, analysing stakeholder needs, etc. During tutorials, students will apply the material and build a working relationship with other team members in a collaborative group learning environment. The collaborative and active learning environment will require students to work with other students in small groups on tutorial and assignment case study exercises. For the assignment case study, students are required to do some pre-work and bring the work in progress (draft models) to the tutorial sessions. Regular feedback will be provided to students each week in the tutorial, for both in-class case studies as well as the assignment case study. This will enable students to identify and correct any issues before formal submission of assignments, and consequently improve their learning and performance in the subject. For weekly assessable quizzes, each week immediate feedback will be provided straight after students have attempted the assessable weekly quizzes. Quizzes will be marked each week and marks will be uploaded to Canvas so that students can track their progress and performance in the subject regularly and before the census date. Please note students are expected to put in some additional study time outside of class time. The University regards a 6 credit point subject as requiring 9-12 hours of study per week, including class time. Students must read the recommended and reference books outside of class time so that they can effectively participate in group work and discussions that are integral to the understanding of the topics. An aim of this subject is to help you develop academic and professional language and communication skills to succeed at university and in the workplace. During the course of this subject, you will complete a milestone assessment task that will, in addition to assessing your subject-specific learning objectives, evaluate your levels of academic and professional communication.

Teaching and learning strategies Each week students are required to prepare for tutorial classes by completing a set of online pre-class tasks provided on Canvas. The tasks involve such activities as reading from key resources, watching a video, completing a quiz, and other online exercises. Responses to the pre-class tasks are used in tutorial classes to add depth to discussion and are an essential component to the concepts covered throughout the subject. During tutorial classes, students will build on the pre-class tasks to learn and apply new skills. These skills will be practiced in class and are designed to be relevant to the tasks involved in the EWB Challenge team project. Areas of learning in tutorial classes include problem solving, team building, exploring scenarios, design and build activities, project management, reflection and group discussion. Activities support acquisition of professional engineering skills in a small group setting under the supervision of a tutor; these skills relate directly to your major EWB Challenge team project. OPELA: An aim of this subject is to help you develop academic and professional language and communication skills in order to succeed at university and in the workplace. To determine your current academic language proficiency, you are required to complete an online language screening task, OPELA. If you receive a Basic grade for OPELA, you must attend additional Language Development Tutorials (each week from weeks 3 to 12) in order to pass the subject. The development of these tutorials is a new university-wide initiative designed to provide personalised support and enhance students’ English language skills. They will focus on developing your communication skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) and your independent learning skills, which will help you to prepare for the subject assessment tasks and for professional workplace communication tasks.
