https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"Information Regarding Undergraduate Engineering - The Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology's flagship course is the five-year Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice (C09067). It also offers a four-year Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (C09066) and a three-year Bachelor of Engineering Science (C10066) to international students only, and a number of combined degrees in partnership with other faculties. The same educational philosophy underpins all awards: students undertake a set of core subjects, a set of practice subjects that defines their major and, in some cases, a set of electives. The Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice award requires the completion of two internships. The single Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and combined Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) courses require the completion of 12 weeks of work experience. The recognition of prior learning policies and assumed knowledge are the same for all courses."
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"Course structure - The course comprises five principal components: (i) core program; (ii) Engineering Practice Program; (iii) field of practice (major); (iv) electives; and (v) Capstone Project. The core program, Engineering Practice Program and Capstone Project are common to all students undertaking the BE (Hons) DipProfEngPrac."
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"Core program -This component provides a framework covering knowledge, skills and attributes that are relevant to all engineers across all fields of practice. It consists of common mathematics and physics subjects, and common engineering subjects which draw on several fields of engineering practice to develop interdisciplinary knowledge and skills within the larger context of professional practice. The core program runs throughout the course from admission to graduation. Students take differing combinations of subjects in their first year, and in each successive year, depending on their choice of major."
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"Engineering Practice Program - The Engineering Practice Program supports and assesses student learning in workplace and community environments. Its objectives are to prepare students for engineering work experience, to support them during that experience and to assist them in maximising learning. The program also supports the integration of this experiential learning with the theoretical and practical aspects of the academic curriculum. A fundamental objective is to develop the ability to learn in a wide variety of modes and contexts and to critique and contribute to those learning environments on a lifelong basis. The program is administered through a series of subjects offered in various modes. Students enrol in the program as a whole and are guided through the respective modules. Students are ultimately responsible for their progression through the program. Academic staff and workplace mentors and supervisors act as facilitators; administrative staff assist in ensuring that students' progress is recorded and validated; and Industry Partnering Unit staff assist students in securing suitable work placements and in establishing cooperative programs with industry and the community. The minimum time in the workplace required to satisfy each engineering internship subject is 22 weeks. In total, however, 48 weeks must be gained by the required deadline to meet course requirements and to be eligible to graduate. Internships are organised into two blocks of six months each. Students are required to undertake the relevant prerequisite subjects prior to undertaking their internships and in a session following an internship are required to enrol in the appropriate review subjects. Credit point limits also apply to some of these subjects. While students are encouraged to undertake additional work experience, they are only permitted to complete each of the two official internships once."
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"STM90993 Professional Engineering Practice Program subjects - Details of prerequisite subjects and subjects required to be completed after each internship are as follows: 41035 Professional Practice Preparation1 - 3cp, 41036 Professional Experience 1 - 6cp , 41037 Work Integrated Learning 1 - 12cp, 41038 Professional Practice Review 1 - 3cp, 41045 Professional Practice Preparation 2 - 3cp, 41046 Professional Experience 2 - 6cp, 41047 Work Integrated Learning 2 - 12p, 41048 Professional Practice Review 2 - 3cp, Total - 48p"
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/eng/area/ug.html,"Electives - With the exception of combined degrees and double majors, students may devote 24 credit points to electives. A range of electives may be taken to broaden or deepen knowledge. The elective component also provides a mechanism for recognition of prior learning. Further, the elective component affords maximum flexibility for students wishing to undertake study on international exchange with our overseas partner institutions. Students are not permitted to take an elective subject that covers substantially the same material as a required subject or a subject already undertaken. Undergraduate students may enrol in approved UTS Engineering postgraduate subjects provided they have completed at least 120 credit points of their undergraduate degree and met prerequisite requirements. Undergraduate students may undertake up to four approved postgraduate subjects. A maximum of three approved postgraduate subjects recently undertaken as part of an undergraduate degree may be used to apply for exemptions from a UTS Engineering master's degree provided the subjects fulfil the equivalent subject requirements."
https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c09067.html,"C09067v6 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice - The program leading to the award of Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice (C09067) (BE(Hons) DipProfEngPrac) is a comprehensive preparation for careers in the professional practice of engineering. The BE(Hons) DipProfEngPrac is a combined award and the Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice is not available separately. Both elements of the program are closely interwoven and interdependent, and prepare students for professional engineering internships by linking theory and application. The degrees combining engineering with business, international studies, medical science and science may also be combined with the Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice. As noted above, the combination of formal academic learning in the University and experiential learning in the workplace is called 'cooperative education'. UTS Engineering courses have embodied this principle for over 30 years. The courses are highly regarded in industry and, according to many reports and surveys, graduates have enjoyed correspondingly high employment rates – the highest of any engineering degree courses in Australia. Engineering education in many countries is undergoing revolutionary change and the UTS program is at the forefront of much of this change. Overview - This program is a comprehensive preparation for careers in the professional practice of engineering. Students learn to deal with complex systems and manage large-scale projects using the most appropriate emerging technologies. The course offers an authentic, professionally focused and practice-based education program with two sessions of internship (normally paid) in a real workplace setting. A number of the areas of study are available with explicit specialisations. For example, Civil Engineering is available with specialisations in Structures and Construction. Students can also focus on or broaden their studies by completing electives. By appropriate choice of electives, students can gain knowledge in a second engineering discipline, obtain a sub-major in a different field or study postgraduate-level subjects and apply for credit towards an engineering master's degree. The concept has been strongly endorsed in wide-ranging industry consultations. Interaction between work experience and academic curriculum is very strong, giving the program a depth that no other full-time academic course can match. Course aims - The course aims to equip graduates with the skills and attributes needed for professional practice and leadership. It is based on the themes of academic development, personal development and professional formation. It provides sound foundations in engineering theory, technical expertise and knowledge of professional practice, while also developing academic literacy, advocacy skills and social awareness so that graduates become lifelong learners and effective citizens in many different capacities.

This subject introduces the core programming concepts using an object-oriented approach to programming, prioritising project-based learning and independent research, experimentation, and communication skills. Additionally, most programming in industry occurs as alterations to a portion of a large existing codebase, and this subject introduces students to how their initial programming explorations may eventually expand to making fixes or improvements to complex industry-scale projects. Subject learning objectives (SLOs) Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to: 1.Apply basic programming concepts of state, iteration, and decision 2.Solve computational problems by using abstract modelling and conceptualisation 3.Design and create simple functioning programs to achieve objectives 4.Interpret, describe, and document programs using clear communication 5.Reflect on programming decisions and formulate alternatives Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs) This subject also contributes specifically to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs): Design Oriented: FEIT graduates apply problem solving, design and decision-making methodologies to develop components, systems and processes to meet specified requirements.

Application of systematic engineering synthesis and design processes. 3.2. Effective oral and written communication in professional and lay domains. Teaching and learning strategies This subject will employ several parallel learning structures to allow students to find a mixture of learning experiences that suits their particular needs. The flipped lecture format allows the students to engage with the learning material in an asynchronous, self-paced, location-independent manner. It also supports a modular approach to delivering core content, permitting students to revise, engage and re-engage as suits their needs. Included in the learning material are staged practice exercises to help the students develop their knowledge and skills in a consequence- and stress-free environment. In the workshops, this learning will be reinforced with scaffolded exercises that weave the core material together and provide a practical experience of the subject matter. These exercises are then capped with a low-stakes assessment task to help the students gauge their progress and understanding of the material. Tying these two structural components together is the weekly drop-in sessions, that offer students a face-to-face expert contact point tailored to their current progress, addressing the exact difficulties they are facing at the time. The learning material also builds towards the larger, ongoing project, which ties the content together into a functioning whole. Content (topics) 1. Simplest Working Program, and Simple Output 2. Data Types and Variables 3. Decisions and Branching Program Flow 4. Arrays and User Input 5. Loops and Iterative Program Flow 6. Classes and Constructors 7. Methods, Properties and Access Control 8.

The tutorial provides collaborative and active learning workshops to support a practice-focused learning strategy. This subject is based on a practical case study and provides regular feedback. The teaching and learning approach is based on learning by doing collaborative work based on case studies. In lectures, topics from the recommended texts are covered and additional material from other sources is introduced where necessary. After introducing the concept and topic in the lecture, students will further apply and practice these topics via interactive and collaborative exercises during the workshops in the tutorials. Additionally, students will be provided with illustrative examples, practice exercises and case studies that further reinforce the material. The lecture followed by a tutorial format are also an extra opportunity for students to ask questions and generate a discussion based on Canvas material. Students will engage in a range of activities such as role playing, think-pair-share, attempting short quizzes each week, short presentations, working in groups, group discussion, critiquing other students’ work, problem solving exercises, analysing stakeholder needs, etc. During tutorials, students will apply the material and build a working relationship with other team members in a collaborative group learning environment. The collaborative and active learning environment will require students to work with other students in small groups on tutorial and assignment case study exercises. For the assignment case study, students are required to do some pre-work and bring the work in progress (draft models) to the tutorial sessions. Regular feedback will be provided to students each week in the tutorial, for both in-class case studies as well as the assignment case study. This will enable students to identify and correct any issues before formal submission of assignments, and consequently improve their learning and performance in the subject. For weekly assessable quizzes, each week immediate feedback will be provided straight after students have attempted the assessable weekly quizzes. Quizzes will be marked each week and marks will be uploaded to Canvas so that students can track their progress and performance in the subject regularly and before the census date. Please note students are expected to put in some additional study time outside of class time. The University regards a 6 credit point subject as requiring 9-12 hours of study per week, including class time. Students must read the recommended and reference books outside of class time so that they can effectively participate in group work and discussions that are integral to the understanding of the topics. An aim of this subject is to help you develop academic and professional language and communication skills to succeed at university and in the workplace. During the course of this subject, you will complete a milestone assessment task that will, in addition to assessing your subject-specific learning objectives, evaluate your levels of academic and professional communication.

Teaching and learning strategies Each week students are required to prepare for tutorial classes by completing a set of online pre-class tasks provided on Canvas. The tasks involve such activities as reading from key resources, watching a video, completing a quiz, and other online exercises. Responses to the pre-class tasks are used in tutorial classes to add depth to discussion and are an essential component to the concepts covered throughout the subject. During tutorial classes, students will build on the pre-class tasks to learn and apply new skills. These skills will be practiced in class and are designed to be relevant to the tasks involved in the EWB Challenge team project. Areas of learning in tutorial classes include problem solving, team building, exploring scenarios, design and build activities, project management, reflection and group discussion. Activities support acquisition of professional engineering skills in a small group setting under the supervision of a tutor; these skills relate directly to your major EWB Challenge team project. OPELA: An aim of this subject is to help you develop academic and professional language and communication skills in order to succeed at university and in the workplace. To determine your current academic language proficiency, you are required to complete an online language screening task, OPELA. If you receive a Basic grade for OPELA, you must attend additional Language Development Tutorials (each week from weeks 3 to 12) in order to pass the subject. The development of these tutorials is a new university-wide initiative designed to provide personalised support and enhance students’ English language skills. They will focus on developing your communication skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) and your independent learning skills, which will help you to prepare for the subject assessment tasks and for professional workplace communication tasks.

It covers the fundamentals of mechanics (kinetics and dynamics), thermodynamics, electricity, fluid dynamics, waves and geometric optics. Students are introduced to the basic techniques of measurement, uncertainty analysis and technical communication.This subject aims to develop the student's understanding of physical principles governing natural processes, and the practice of applying these principles to create predictive models of simple engineered systems. Students also appreciate the limits of validity of these models by testing and analysing the models they have created. This subject also emphasises the quantitative problem solving that is possible with correct physical models through the use of calculus and algebra. Thus, students develop a framework for understanding and modelling natural phenomena that is carried over into design and analysis in engineering.Students see that physics both enables and restrains engineering. Designs that are inconsistent with the laws of physics cannot be realised while much engineering innovation demands new physical insight or innovative uses of existing physical and mathematical models.The subject also seeks to give students insights into the processes and pleasures of physics itself as a professional discipline. This includes basic experiences with the analytical, problem solving, observational and technical as well as measurement skills needed to model natural processes. The technical communication and other generic skills developed in this subject are further developed in later subjects. Graduates and later stage students, whether using physics themselves, working with physicists in a research or design team, or using new products based on advanced physics concepts, need to function in a world of innovation in which physical understanding and new physics plays a key role. This subject initiates the insights and attitudes relevant to this goal.Subject learning objectives (SLOs)Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:1.understand the conceptual basis in mechanics, thermal physics, oscillations, waves, electricity, fluids and optics2.solve problems proficiently in selected areas of fundamental physics3.apply mathematical models to describe and understand the natural world4.measure basic physical phenomena, analyse data and verify mathematical models5.demonstrate technical communication, project planning, team and time management skills6.understand the nature of physics as a professional discipline of great importance to engineering innovationCourse intended learning outcomes (CILOs)This subject also contributes specifically to the development of following course intended learning outcomes:Technically Proficient: FEIT graduates apply abstraction, mathematics and discipline fundamentals, software, tools and techniques to evaluate, implement and operate systems. (D.1)Contribution to the development of graduate attributesThe Physical Modelling subject embeds the UTS Graduate Attributes by having the following elements incorporated in the subject:‘Learning to learn’Students are expected to demonstrate information literacy and critical thinking and to use appropriate language to describe what has been learned. In 68037 these will be assessed through discussions in the laboratory sessions, laboratory reports and a final exam.‘Professional Attributes’The laboratory reports and the formal final exam will provide a summative evaluation of your command of the subject material. The subject teaches technical, manipulative and design skills in the form of conducting phenomena exploring laboratory experiments where communication and collaborative skills play an important part. Technical writing skills are developed and assessed by compiling laboratory reports. Experiments are carried out in small groups where students have the opportunity to develop collaborative, group work skills which are essential skills desired by employers.The University has a strong, enforced policy relating to assessment items on plagiarism, collusion, and fraudulent data to emphasise the importance of the life-long habit of ethical conduct.Each student has a number of tasks for this and other subjects, which must be efficiently and effectively managed throughout the semester. This also develops time management skills.‘Personal Attributes’The laboratory reports require you to seek and incorporate into submitted work up-to-date information from literature found in the library, on-line or other sources.

Creative, innovative and pro-active demeanour.Teaching and learning strategiesStudents will learn through a combination of lectures and tutorials where they will engage in collaborative learning activities as well as online discussions with their peers. Students will form teams to investigate information systems development methodologies with reference to case studies.Information Systems (IS) Development Methodologies is supported by slides, tutorial work and case studies on Canvas and a text book for this subject. Students are required to access and use the weekly pre-class materials as a sense making exercise attempting to create questions and explanations that will be used in class. The slides include directions on how to solve different problems arising out of the system at different times. Questions arise from discussions and experiences, these are proposed and discussed in tutorial groups. In class the lecturer explains the complex background for each topic based on these Canvas materials and encourages students to use their sense making to clarify their interpretations through verbal feedback.Tutorials follow the class, in which students form groups. Each week, fifteen minutes is spent to discuss feedback on the assessment tasks. Students work in groups and are given questions based on a case study. They are required to use design thinking to define the problem and encouraged to come up with solution ideas that they present to the whole class. Students are expected to critique and evaluate each other’s responses. This imparts peer feedback on a weekly basis so that students learn from one another. Tutorial activities and assessment tasks are based on collaborative activities which require decision making skills.Content (topics)Information System Development Life CycleTechniques and ToolsInformation System Development MethodologiesFramework for evaluating methodologiesComparison of some methodologiesAssessmentAssessment task 1: Review QuizObjective(s):This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs):1 and 2This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):B.1 and C.1Type:Quiz/testGroupwork:IndividualWeight:10%Assessment task 2: Project ReportObjective(s):This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs):1, 2, 3 and 4This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):B.1, C.1 and D.1Type:PresentationGroupwork:Group, group assessedWeight:30%Length:The Report should not be more than 2000 words.Criteria:Assessment details and marking criteria can be found in Canvas.Assessment task 3: Project PresentationObjective(s):This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs):3 and 4This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):D.1Type:DemonstrationGroupwork:IndividualWeight:15%Assessment task 4: Final ExamObjective(s):This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs):1, 2 and 3This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):B.1, C.1 and D.1Type:ExaminationGroupwork:IndividualWeight:45%Minimum requirementsIn order to pass the subject, a student must achieve an overall mark of 50% or more.Recommended textsPressman, R.S. and Maxim, B.R.

Orderly management of self, and professional conduct.Teaching and learning strategiesThe subject is delivered in block mode with a blend of online and face-to-face learning opportunities including 1 recorded lecture, 2 tutorials, and 1 seminar.The lecture outlines the requirements of the subject and the online resources available to students to support their learning. Students will be introduced to: 1) the writing of critical incidents, 2) the skills of constructive critical review, and 3) the demands of an online 3-slide presentation. Students are expected to have prepared for this lecture as outlined in the program (see next section of this subject outline).Students should familiarise themselves with the methods of giving and receiving feedback presented in the lecture and detailed in the Learning Guide. They should also look at the two models for writing reflections outlined in the guide.These models will be described in the lecture and the qualities of a good reflection will be elicited in the tutorials.Before the first face-to-face classes, students submit their reflections to the group journal function in Canvas. They then complete the reflection checklist found in the learning materials for the work of other group members.In the tutorial, these checklists will be used as the basis of feedback of each other’s work. The discussion will be widened to identify areas of common experience and difference, strengths they discovered during their internship as well as areas requiring work. Through this synthesis of experience, students will begin to articulate their professional identity.Students summarise the feedback they have received from their peers for assessment Task 1.After they have had time to react to the feedback, students will be required to submit their three reflections. This is assessment task 2.The second tutorial is designed for students to work collaboratively to prepare for a 3-slide presentation on their internship. Students should use photos or artefacts from their internship where appropriate.The aim of the presentation is to describe the student’s journey. This will include expectations before commencement of the internship, the role within the company and the lessons learned from their experiences.AssessmentAssessment task 1: Review of peers� draft reflectionsIntent:To give feedback on the three draft reflections, and to get feedback from peers on their internship and the writing of their reflections.Objective(s):This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs):1 and 2This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):E.1 and F.1Type:ExercisesGroupwork:Group, group and individually assessedLength:Approximately 1500 words for the draft reflections and 2c) a paragraph summarising the feedback received from peers.Assessment task 2: Completed ReflectionsIntent:Students begin to establish their identity as professional engineers which develops the confidence and the resilience necessary to succeed in their future studies.Objective(s):This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs):1 and 2This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):E.1 and F.1Type:ReflectionGroupwork:IndividualLength:1500 wordsCriteria:Reflections should:recount/describe experiencereact to and evaluate that experience including identifying feelings, and/or reflecting upon personal beliefsrecognizing and analysing difficultiesrelate the experience to academic, professional, or broader literature related to the topic referencing this literature in accordance with the UTS Harvard conventions, evidencing literate engagement with the topicsexplain what lessons have been learned (retrospective outcomes), and what the student’s future intentions are (prospective outcomes) in relation to each topic.Language use communicates meaning clearly with a professional/formal degree of accuracy indicative of careful editing.Assessment task 3: Three-slide presentationIntent:To assess students’ ability to verbally establish a professional identity and to discuss aspects of interest about their professional experience.Objective(s):This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs):1 and 2This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):E.1 and F.1Type:PresentationGroupwork:IndividualLength:5-8 minutesMinimum requirementsIn order to pass the subject, a student must attempt all tasks and meet a satisfactory standard in all areas and achieve a pass in all assessments.Recommended textsDowling, D., Hadgraft, R., Carew, A., McCarthy, T., Hargreaves, D., Baillie, C., & Male.

Application of systematic engineering synthesis and design processes.3.5. Orderly management of self, and professional conduct.3.6. Effective team membership and team leadership.Teaching and learning strategiesStudents engage in a group project with a focus on sustainability. They will learn how to take a systems thinking approach to understanding how sustainable solutions for complex problems can be developed. In successive iterations, students will rotate through looking at the project through different aspects of sustainability, each iteration building on the work of their peers, incorporating peer and teacher feedback at each stage.Students will be given a project context to research from various angles individually, and will then share and build on each other’s work to develop an understanding of the context and their collaboration skills. Students will use this research as a basis for selecting sustainability approaches, frameworks and tools that can best be used to develop a solution. As a group, they will design and propose a solution that incorporates consideration of different factors of sustainability, including financial considerations, and will engage with report frameworks to help present their solution.By this stage in their degrees, students have completed several teamwork and design projects. In addition to their work on their design project, in this subject, students learn about reflection and apply these skills to reflect on their learning thus far about engineering projects, and identify what other skills they would like to develop. They will have opportunities to further reflect on their professional development in the Professional Practice Program.Content (topics)The subject covers the following topics:Systems thinkingproblem definition and analysisbusiness rationale and financial considerations of sustainable developmentchoice of sustainability approaches including frameworks, methods and tools – fit for purposesustainability lifecyclewhole system designenvironmental, economic and social implications – including competencies and other such resourceslocal reporting requirements – Environmental-Social-Governance (ESG) criteria, National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER), mandatory vs optional frameworksAssessmentAssessment task 1: Research reportIntent:To demonstrate an understanding of the underlying concepts of sustainability as they apply to a specific context.Objective(s):This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs):1 and 3This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):B.1 and E.1Type:ReportGroupwork:IndividualWeight:20%Length:1000 wordsAssessment task 2: Presentation of interim reportIntent:To present an interim report detailing project progress and application of sustainability and systems thinking, in order to receive feedback to inform the final project design.Objective(s):This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs):1, 2 and 3This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):B.1, C.1 and E.1Type:PresentationGroupwork:Group, group and individually assessedWeight:25%Length:5 Minute presentation and 2000 word written briefAssessment task 3: Final reportIntent:Apply professional written and verbal communication skills to present research findings and recommendations that meet client needs.Objective(s):This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs):1, 2 and 3This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):B.1, C.1 and E.1Type:ReportGroupwork:Group, group and individually assessedWeight:40%Length:3000 wordsAssessment task 4: PortfolioIntent:To demonstrate reflection of learning to date, and plan for future development toward being a professional engineerObjective(s):This assessment task addresses the following subject learning objectives (SLOs):4This assessment task contributes to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):F.1Type:PortfolioGroupwork:IndividualWeight:15%Length:1000 wordsMinimum requirementsIn order to pass the subject, a student must achieve an overall mark of 50% or more."

In small self-managed teams, students are guided through the early stages of team formation and agile project planning before adopting greater autonomy for the remainder of the project. Teams are aided and guided by tutors knowledgeable about and experienced in software development.To encourage peer learning, all teams formally critique the work of another team at significant stages during the project life cycle. To encourage high technical standards, high achievement and peer learning, all teams develop a system from specified requirements but are free to decide how those requirements can be implemented to achieve greater customer satisfaction.Tutors provide weekly feedback about progress, intended activities and achievements to date. Formal assessment of the project outcomes and deliverables occurs at mid-term and end of term. Early term team formation and skill development activities provide opportunities for feedback about essential team and technical skills. Students are also expected to participate in peer evaluations of teamwork via SparkPLUS.

It is carried out in two phases: the preparation and planning phase in this subject, and the implementation phase in 41030 Engineering Capstone. Students undertake the capstone project in their final year of study.In these two subjects students solve complicated engineering problems that respond to industrial, academic and personal interests, taking a systematic approach. The types of capstone projects that students can undertake include research and development, investigation, experimentation, design, building and manufacturing. Students in this subject develop skills in research design, project management and critical communication.This subject, Engineering Research Preparation, emphasises the development of the theoretical framework and the associated project plan for a student's capstone project. The subject is followed by the implementation phase in 41030. Both subjects aim to strengthen students' knowledge application, and research and communication competencies to the graduate level for engineering practice as per Engineers Australia Stage 1 competencies and faculty graduate attributes. Both subjects also align with Australian Qualifications Framework criteria of graduation concerning knowledge, skills development and application to the bachelor's (level 7) and honours (level 8) degrees.Subject learning objectives (SLOs)Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:1Define a research interest related to their field of practice (major), develop this interest into a researchable question within constraints, and conduct preliminary research2Survey the relevant literature, and review it to establish the potential for a significant contribution to an existing field of knowledge3Develop a research project proposalCourse intended learning outcomes (CILOs)This subject also contributes specifically to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):Socially Responsible: FEIT graduates identify, engage, interpret and analyse stakeholder needs and cultural perspectives, establish priorities and goals, and identify constraints, uncertainties and risks (social, ethical, cultural, legislative, environmental, economics etc.) to define the system requirements.

The early stages of development must balance problem exploration and design with convergence toward an implementable solution. Developing large, complex systems, that must work perfectly, requires software engineering practices to ensure the development happens in a controlled manner. Developing the professional discipline to use and maintain all the necessary practices is best done through experience, for little else convinces us of their need than our failings.The focus of this subject is to experience and understand the longer-term consequences of selected and configured software development methods, tools, and resources, then to consider, decide and implement improvements.Subject learning objectives (SLOs)Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:1.
