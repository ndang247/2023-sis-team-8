## How to use Docker Compose to run both the front end and backend at the same time 
* Install Docker Compose
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/

1. Make sure youre in the projects main directory
2. type in the terminal: ```docker compose build```
3. type in the terminal: ```docker compose up```

*This should startup both the frontend and backend servers

## Running The Front-end Locally
* Clone the project either via HTTP or SSH (preferred)
* Open the project in a terminal and `cd` or navigate into `fe` directory
* Run the command `npm install` to install all the required dependencies
* Run the command `npm run dev` to run and open up the project in `localhost`
